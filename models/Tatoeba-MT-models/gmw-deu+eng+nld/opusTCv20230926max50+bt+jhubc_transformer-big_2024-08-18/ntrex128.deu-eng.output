Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) sparks dismay.
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of the mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the entire group was “not happy” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
Regarding the titles of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) panel preferred, while the MWP option received the greatest support at a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle for consensus for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly can vote on their name definitively in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim to the Greek territory rises, and has repeatedly opposed its admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I was talking to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more both today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives are different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will be back in the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of retailers at 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell play.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who ringed the bell game in July used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by the lay leaders of the church and some by the bishop’s diocese.
In July, the municipal board – the community’s leadership body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would attempt to pass on the costs to the municipal board, although the latter had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old in California Diving After Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been scuba diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries of help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The nature of the shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but they are largely not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks boots, superdrug and Debenhams with department stores-like cosmetics departments staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale advance to the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods turnover declines, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores nationwide, and if successful, they will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the supermarkets’ search for ways to otherwise use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury’s, for the first time, the scope of its cosmetics offering doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is carrying out a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique”, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury’s stores, opening its first store last week in Croydon, south of London, and opening a second one later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the acquisition of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established a number of Argos sales outlets in hundreds of stores and a number of Habitat sales outlets, which has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drugstore's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve redesigned the look of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the enticing environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases, which challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after withdrawing Holly Willoughbys from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "enraged" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The “This Morning” presenter, 37, announced her resignation on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby outraged “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “enraged” when television’s “Golden Girl” admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, not being able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly due to their new business worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure for them their future in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, which is one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby Jones source said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business matters.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “not presidential” and for such positive comments about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said mimicking the voice of a news presenter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. adhered to sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in the relief measures.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country remains unfortunately ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not an everyday sight on other coastal stripes.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning coming into force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new catastrophe in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing denominational tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when bands of Christians and Muslims fought each other on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep strikeout against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge Stadium with an 89th minute goal before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0-1 gap at about 27 meters from Chelsea goal.
He pointed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear pole.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led the Belgian star Eden Hazard to the half-time 1:0 after a 25-minute goal.
The blues striker gave a heeled pass back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and finished with a left-handed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool will play at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
Number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Civil Protection Agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that had been brought down by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was dotted with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspecting murder.
Police ask residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken anything with a dashcam, to contact us and they may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police said that she is in the process of informing the next relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She repeats again and again, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barrier and another vehicle was in front of the barrier.
Inside the lockdown were several police officers who were monitoring the block of flats.
Persons who have information will be asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to the record 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the newest monument to be the subject of the dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of the Taliban, of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was unavoidable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was the target in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The storm of images in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure who, according to many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate presentation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Bites Chinese Farmers Dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a severed artery bloodshed near a pig shed on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had bite the farmer dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin to whom the surname was named “Wu” was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Photographs of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on more people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig clamped a Welsh farmer between him and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to twitch and are very curious ... they are not eager to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is weakening along the way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding-causing rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the growing trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, water-driving debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity in places leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in much of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall, flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions is possible.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly discouraged to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause streams to rip out of canyons, and thunderstorms locally bring wind gusts as well as winds that bring dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation amounts of over one centimetre are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first precipitation of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, and it rains widely on Monday evenings and Tuesdays.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, severe temperature fluctuations are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the US.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
For much of the center and east of the U.S., a warm October start with widespread temperatures around 27oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
Over 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and on Friday, the television stations interrupted their regular program because of a last-minute twist: a deal negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds roughly to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest number of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters loudly pressuring him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood for minutes with a lowered look while being scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on forwarding Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would do so only on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as demanded by the democratic minority.
Flake can be convinced in part by talking to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Using Brexit for Political Purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to use Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a different interview published on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal for the mutual collection of tariffs by Britain and the EU “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released video footage of the battle between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on the glasses.
After a Simpsons interview, police said he confessed to the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reported that the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal engineering laboratory of the state police, the Southern University Police, and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement for “their care and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" and "under shock" over Wayde's death.
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of rumblings and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity on the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the preparedness police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, withheld by the standby police, threw eggs on them and also swirled colored powders, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness," while confronting Unionists shouting "Long live Spain."
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the referendum of October 1, which Madrid saw as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
Voters had overwhelmingly voted for independence, although the voter turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer sees the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention, waiting for their trials because of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament election next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way is to denounce the dismantling of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, it may have been shot with a crossbow on the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas hit proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without a away win and will face the Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his series of victories in the division to six games, which means that head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against openly-playing guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers before a wide variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance at which Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly put Menga in shot position, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but were unable to overcome the host's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unchallenged.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered the Livingston penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalties – one by Halkett against the substituted Glenn Middleton and one for hand play – were denied.
“Phänomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and have again exceeded expectations in this uptrend.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on track throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was to serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also listened, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and insulted by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The clash occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in a driver’s flight accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialized "tornado" officials were recruited to end the riots involving eight inmates limited to one wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, mission officers were called to prison to counter serious riots in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Flood-like Floods (Dryer Areas May Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s probably what will happen early next week when the remnants of hurricane pink pull over the desert-ridden southwest and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada as well as southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and pull directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to 320 kilometers as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with occasional precipitation up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-defining southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are probable and, occasionally, up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to drought in the region.
Although flooding is very worrying, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category.
First, the hurricane path means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and will then move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected to range from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible,” reported weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will move northwards across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move upwards through Arizona to southern Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“The main danger associated with Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert, and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening flooding in the desert and water-driving debris as well as landslides in mountainous areas are expected.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
According to the find of a 16-year-old with sting wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the meanness, the rage” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the meanness, the rage” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said Thursday in front of Congress, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her accusation.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the endorsement of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the endorsement of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t kick in, but in reality I kick in,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resistance and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, number of victims rises
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were washed away when huge waves struck the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi due to a severe earthquake and tsunami.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of Palu City, when, in the dark, waves of up to six meters high hit the beach, ripping many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB, said at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it floated cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had been pulled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive Friday quake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of many victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore, floating buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport will remain closed until October and will only be reopened for relief.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, along the way passed scenes of devastation.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the aid groups began with the hard task of starting disaster relief, some argued that skilled foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible when the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status has not been valid.”
As the second night since the earthquake and Friday's tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family members of the missing were hoping for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in debris next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa-Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who took part in the beach party.
However, his messages instead of blue check marks only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news was not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 while filling an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to invest more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a sack of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the news release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “The Being Formally Known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘yes’ became – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West worked earlier, has written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people”.
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, while leftist student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student support and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased artificial intelligence activities, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this field, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so much behind the US, and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling financial resources could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player, later serving as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to Lees, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to the U.S.’s AI efforts.
“I think people who are promoted in the field of AI should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council unveiled its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to U.S. researchers, however, the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are to be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have not been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this entitles to the Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubts that the voter turnout will reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote result is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
“I am here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of the country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvered through the entire Brighton defence to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defensive players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on that move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the ever-powerful Scherzer hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw, because we know the atmosphere with the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why would I not want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are, according to reports, inclined to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander this season has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation related to Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not going to compete, but in reality I’m going to compete, which is why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as “resistance and blocking.”
“And you see this in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “enraged and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud buhrufs among the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to rebuke me, this came little surprising.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome – just because we are saying our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had been vigorously opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the motion for a retaliation for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "the meetings should all be included and productive".
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised "friendly, more cautious" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is assessed according to whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions I would never have agreed with otherwise – be it on national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – no matter what I say – a social media swindler calls for my vote, denounces the political center and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with that experience, I’m not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, yet never admit small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of no-confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the past two years, I have often been advised not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would "have no problems".
But I did not go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally disintegrated my classroom in the general school, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most – as a councillor as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hole in my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I would just like to say the following: given the fact that the country is racing for a Brexit that will harm budgets, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am not addressing this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many more electoral threats or political intentions will not stop me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
You are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better exploitation of chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, which was boosted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but Melrose was able to let the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a not-increased attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before hitting directly at halftime and then scoring an increased attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the pitch. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Climo increased by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the extra man paid for by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr pack from the penalty lane.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "floating restaurant business."
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, which is enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings a sea-blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
Reclaiming it is a duty.”
Everywhere in land-locked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to drive back across the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice to be made on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will pursue the ICC ruling on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, according to which Chile is obliged, after decades of sporadic talks, to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year, is also at stake in the verdict on Monday.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body, which is based in the Netherlands, is not authorized to grant Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, the ICJ’s ruling is already six months after the final plea, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken on the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric suffocated Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, dismissed the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a “opportunity to put an end to the 139 years of mutual benefit disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore, seems on the verge of restarting the trapped nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North to its knees, as a “brain.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renunciating an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collections of giant headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed on the catwalk a range of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feathery wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were stitched on lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream bag.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with 60 centimetres wide edge, all of which are worn from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation across the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit-wearing model that held the bag.
The reddish orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the striking piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only backed up by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current examination results of this year show that languages with the highest standings are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A in the higher exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved grade A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who studied German, 69 percent of students who studied French, and 63 percent of students who studied Spanish also achieved grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17% of the reasons employers cited for vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equip them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron ahead of Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the pre-season.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet known.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably only play for a few minutes.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallying tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies planned for next week, including in sympathetic places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In light of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. (East Coast Time).
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address hearings by Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct held in a tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate vote on the confirmation remaining in the limelight for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans who face a difficult November election.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that next week’s five rallies serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy election campaign season is approaching,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to name his name, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report media from Pittsburgh.
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Combat Ready to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-part games on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum as a sports concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum in your opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that’s a little momentum for us,” Jordan Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe, of course, has an advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
The Americans, however, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can have three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and sets a good example.
The guttural cries of enthusiasm became louder in the course of his lap as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both, after he and Thomas had relegated after two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar cry, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really have to kneel down and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players in the last two days to score more points than Spieth and Thomas, undoubtedly writing the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" wasn't the only couple who didn't beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey's on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd confirm that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory over Le Golf National when the sun goes down.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of four, who played with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a tight spot that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you out.
The pairs of fours and fours are so intriguing to look at from close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change at lightning speed.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the U.S. with 10:6 after the fours and fours of Saturday and goes with a solid lead to the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The ingeniously playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and thus scored four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to regain the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the quarterfinals, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but failed to catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were christened “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the disenchanted Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance flash, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything ran according to their ideas.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain in the fours and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point gap, but as the title holder, Furyk's team will have a draw to keep the trophy.
Since they have only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken “essential action” last year, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site and committing itself not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see any corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between an incumbent U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks an official end to the Korean War led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes calls for a easing of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even opposed to 'declaring the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a brainspin of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’s speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea’s missiles on the U.S. mainland after “the evil president” called Trump a “missile man” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the “complete destruction” of North Korea last year, overshadowed Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage in disarmament moves, but he said there is still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must in any case be continued vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, when leaving Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made only to be accused hours later by North Korea of having made “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding action.”
He said Kim had told him that the targeted “corresponding measures” were security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn Enough to Sleep in One Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture of keeping up with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had opted to launch the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, students see the image of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee mugs, curtains, training shoes and books, providing information on the effect of caffeine and light, as well as on the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university site with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just like you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a “night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will prompt all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should set up an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emanates from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circadian rhythm out of time, which leads to problems when falling asleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away match when the Dolly Menga hit for Steven Gerrard's unisoning team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the first second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the hearts that lead by far in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in danger of further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr overtook and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts one point last week, and would have to be thrilled as his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes when Menga's first pitch Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot past the rear pole.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not let the complaints of the Colombian apply.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute hit may not have matched the game's progress, there is no denying that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded at halftime and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow shot a header from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick late after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “Actually, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” degenerate cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells.
In the method, a patient is taken from immune cells that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, a patient is taken from immune cells, which are altered in the laboratory in such a way that they can "see" the many cancers common protein HER2, and then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method, in which patients are extracted from immune cells and are taught to attack cancer cells, has helped treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio at Saturday Night Live after lauding US President Donald Trump and saying he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a make-america-great-again cap, he continued with a cannonade against the Democrats, emphasizing once again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimney irade was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the release of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had had trouble behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with the cap."
They harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “He’s going to put on my supermancape because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered buhrufs from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "It was silent in the studio."
West had late been hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", where he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELIVERED THE MASS.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts and adopts an ideology that is detrimental to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Indictment of attempted murder in connection with stab wounds in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear before the arbitral tribunal in Belfast on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong, asking how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who is also a member of Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was “very important.”
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now witnessing?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men clearly something went wrong.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", he has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be featured in a re-issue of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the numerous Emmys-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married at Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases due to sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaking data from GOP senators, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a U.S. House MP, denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MPs’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat felt that the allegations of “ultra-right” experts and websites were spread.
“Lies, lies, and even more hideous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information will include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during the hearing of a Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were endangered by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This dementi is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of doing something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English – Man lives only three times – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The spy who rubbed it” and revived stutteringly in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now quite”.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, how obviously stupid we are, become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glot-eyed, grimace-cutting and incompetent Johnny English to mess up was extended for the second time, his name more than anything else signalling that he is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of something Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a chuck of this fellow who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and thought the rotor blades were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now also offer self-confident comedic elements.
Humor seems to be directed more towards children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and uncovered the identities of all British agents in use, much to the displeasure of the incumbent agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been exposed and therefore she has to get someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but unofficial lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former hard-tested cumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terribly wrong in Your Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously caught in the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque fun: dressed as waiters, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Quite moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan to make Britain work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan that requires the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) to employees in the form of an additional day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that is consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium in favour of workers, as well as with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea, and the Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is currently not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water utilities may not be able to get their entire share back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to corporate boards and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of private company equity to employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the 60 Minutes news magazine whether the FBI’s investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the agency could affect Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that could ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the court that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is certain as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she called could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the 7th time this year, not only to witness the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international stakeholder group seeks to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in poverty reduction.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project when you consider that Global Citizen remains for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of offering a cool free concert a sensible way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen said the project has seen more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce more than $37 billion worth of commitments and strategies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country at $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions prompting the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and strenuous journey with ups and downs.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The U.S. could use the Navy for blockade purposes to obstruct Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if needed so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets, and Russia is currently working in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the seaways remain open, and block them if necessary, in order to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“Using and replacing fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, describing Russia as a “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was in the process of expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is said to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said the board of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidacy, Senator for Massachusetts says
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is heading this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump handles our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for office.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent advocating a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin Speaks Out at the Donald Trump Rally on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Under which Track Palin Suffers
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can imitate other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in the room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back more early, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and D.C. support a remedy for the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a remedy for new U.S. policies that deny asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning politics, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace Against Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, state and international levels.”
"The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," was stated in the court expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that deny immigrants access to the country have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, as immigrants may be more likely to act as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asyl is for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or out of fear because of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It has never been the plan, by granting asylum, to mitigate all the problems, even all the serious problems people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of fatalities in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the ruined downtown of Palu.
“Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their soaked belongings and store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to the ongoing severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the invaded walls,” he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s call for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital Beijing of exploiting the American press for progaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has attempted to interfere in the U.S. election are in line with U.S. officials’ announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a far-reaching trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, which exports agricultural products to China on a large scale, said Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government claims America’s proven tradition of free speech and independent press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of counter-votes at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, and you will find no real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans scold voters before midterm elections with debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
With many of the most influential Republicans supporting and defending the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could be especially women’s.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University’s The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow or even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hallway of the Senate shouted "November is coming!" when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important issue, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the affirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting the panel, final voting or reviewing Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree on whom they should believe based on Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or likely to be convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were definitely or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied about his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judicial Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that the intention behind Inrupt was “world domination”.
“We need to get active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all content is available in a browser at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide on his own who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development of data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not exchange views with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
“We do not ask for your permission.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The Church of England's only clergyman, who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British War award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before running forward on his own with a field weapon and shutting out three of the military units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero became visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine staying awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, audiences in the UK were not badly surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig could be seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to a government regulation, this content is classified as not youth-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take viewers from the UK into account in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved in the repetition game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday in the UK, and we’re not going to solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're on track.
The change was communicated quite a lot. It was quite messed up and it was not always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical failure.
What was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve tried to give fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Subdue’ to Sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said since he became a father, the victories at the Olympics are not so important to him anymore.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for several months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as the love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of being inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games today is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on this issue because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been an issue.
He says if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important things than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of a local audience at Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this, he heard the song in the run-up to the Olympics and still cared for goosebumps.

Mickelson, currently out of shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn’t become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the event as usual, the five-time Major winner spent his day cheering others on and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the tight Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start in the 12 individual games with four points behind, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was completely clear about his role today, gave me a slap on my back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world’s best known personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went now and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to have some fun, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impetus.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was scarce,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured) after seeing the 5–3 win of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10–6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
It's going to be a good start tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do just the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the dots are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said it, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what is facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Bjorn continued: “I’d never rush that, but I’m happy about the performance his players have achieved on a difficult golf course.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow the individual performances are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’ll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform better individually than on the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of that big turnout on the last day of the tournament, and he was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We put our team up accordingly and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to conjure up tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of kicking back, he has to compete in the top match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as additional Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I chose the guys in that order, because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German navy should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but according to local media it will not be delivered until early next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand new frigate of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigate of the Bremen class.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and naval target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate followed by the accident hit the headlines last year, when the German navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and preventing the Navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military officer, confirmed that the navy "has run out of operational ships".
Bartels said the problem grew with time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the Brown Long Ear and Water Bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key locations on the property to record the bats’ activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all images by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and habitat report is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their nocturnal hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echometry to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct examinations, sleeper inspections, and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so here and in other goods we are doing these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nesting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape allegations against him as “fake news” and said that people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news" hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to make a name for themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is good," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for the allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damage at a level that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is presumably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped them anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to her knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent a good guy” who was “one percent” killed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had “fear of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the deal, as she is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and this summer switched to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would ‘perpetually regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would “perpetually regret” losing its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, economics minister Greg Clark said.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should the UK leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit, we will see production stops at our factory at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facility is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars to order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts, according to the industry.
It was impossible for Toyota to keep a stock at the Derbyshire plant, which would last more than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on future relationship with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long the production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they’re gone.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to White House reports
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “by another week,” while the dispute over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversighted the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and a possible impediment to justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the vice justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the president’s impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, as new reports of his alleged resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the Senate Judicial Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine it being postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court right now.
That will show up, but I'm always happy to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences does not depend on a dislike for the TV reporters' "effect-hash" but admitted: "I would not deny that they do effect-hash."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president in front of him," she explained, without providing accurate evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it will be far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this frequently and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he dropped a run-off and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns to EU workers at Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health is addressing people from abroad who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralized public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the exit negotiations between the UK and the EU continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for all of you.
Therefore, I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is totally your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury he suffered on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details are yet known about the nature or extent of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenue will benefit the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in surplus revenue to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with the surplus income intended to benefit the homeless.
This move is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue will be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties left for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the UK, driving prices up and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, became "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just weeks after Boris Johnson has voiced his support for a reduction in the stamp tax to allow more young people to get their first home.
He accused construction companies of upholding property prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "living space shame."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a staggering set of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to the ban on evictions for no valid reason.
He also wants to grant city councillors more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that would make life better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be true that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as it is for hard-working UK citizens.
The dream of home has become too far away for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his “greatest goal” is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the North-East of England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child I’ve often seen Scotland play with my father in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in club management.”
Ross' predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated not to be afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only see my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a management career of only three years, after a period as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny, as I wasn’t doing badly, was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult.”

The heat wave in the summer has given rise to the revenues of Britain’s crippling pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenues from restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s management consultancy, which compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, where pubs saw revenue increases of 2.8 percent, but restaurant hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverages showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted turnover trend that rose higher than it dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with an emphasis on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of the RSM leisure and restaurant industry analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused companies, and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite."
Overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep them secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools has seen an increase in so-called "fake insta" pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they own a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
One mother, who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenage boy who asked others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are being tricked into creating online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes "voice of athletes" in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member to the council of the Scottish Athletics Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that Scotland's athletics would benefit greatly from her election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, named a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for breast pumps that compares mothers with cows creates excitement on the net
A manufacturer of breast pumps provided excitement on the net with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
For the launch of the world's first low-noise portable breast pump, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie publishes a music video that is not entirely serious in order to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail at me" or "if you haven't noticed, these are not udders but my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has sparked a controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it harmonizes the “terror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of giving birth,” the statement said.

Another comment was: “It’s understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added, “Such a non-reality advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that she found the song "comic."
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping off, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to over-interpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use breast pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all the associated challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump enables.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-time mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly transported to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned migrant children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things, as aggravated rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target for expulsion when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Customs Authority, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either themselves caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household are illegally living in the country, and a large proportion of them are delinquent foreigners.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to deal with the children’s cases faster, officials introduced new rules that, according to accommodation staff, require some children to appear in court within one month rather than 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear by video and not in person to stand up for their legal status in front of an immigration judge.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have been reported from the system in the last month, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are aggravated at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could intensify traumas that many of the children already suffer from if they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and “are treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return are given and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prevent refugees from going home.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid will be granted to Syria as long as there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib represents an opportunity for advancing political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey targeted a wide-ranging offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, would be "extinguished."
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, an impeachment or scandal did not end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of any presidency of all time.”
So far, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s top-of-the-line ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that magically attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama series about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of a round of experts using Bob Woodward’s sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket (according to Washington Post a “clothing piece of self-esteem discussed by Trump) or the effects of Stormy’s Anatomie.
I will never be able to see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he’s doing makes it feel like a reality show he’s performing every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three from the Pfandhaus,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily action twists (breaking a fight with the NFL football league off the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his home on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he hid inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen, not when Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was on the verge of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the tightest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the constituencies that led to two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently re-drawn suburban district in Pittsburg takes on Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the wake of a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a much-regarded special election in March around the state's 18th constituency.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won there with 20 percentage points.
Politicians give Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partner threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to deduct the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were penal measures considered, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed punitive measures, including financial relief cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that was to follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled to take place in mid-October, in order to set a sign of the importance the government is giving to the Assembly, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh communications or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed on the condition of anonymity to comment on the internal meetings.
Their statements were reaffirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learning from history
The next big surprise might be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the Congressional majority change, Trump would be confronted with an organ that would force him to be held accountable, exactly at the time he passed on to step back in front of the voters; and possibly in front of a jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein got into Teufel’s kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denies the portrayal of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and falsehood?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that forces Trump to be held accountable?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we’ll fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers received Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“That was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good,” says the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we’ll get three points, but that’s going to be a tough game, because they’ve scored a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can do it with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement for women leads to sleepless nights.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional nursing insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid litigation at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that play a role. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?
You’ve already finished this plan.”
Man in Ilfracombe bombed several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after working with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly, and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 2:30 p.m. in Britain, as an “involuntary act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-strong earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a administrative district in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island, stretching over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s northern Sumatra province of Aceh triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya administrative district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunamis.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and claimed over 500 deaths, especially on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence allegations
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidate for the office of vice president, was arrested for allegations of bodily harm.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and resistance to state power, according to a report published by Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a friend when he wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been levied.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied with “Not guilty, for sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A offences, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being discussed before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 for attributing her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-thick earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time when the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack that cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the hardware store chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which he rushed to a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, driving pedestrians and cyclists over.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" killing the eight ovens and "consciously" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the Memorandum of Understanding for the Death Penalty Claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be sentenced to death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative tribunal presented Saipov with a 22-point indictment, which includes eight counts of murder against the background of organized crime normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires “fundamental planning and intent,” as the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act, described as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnacco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified to a lack of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He was not guilty in all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the indictment not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest action at the Tories Conference.
Ukip’s former party leader stated that politicians “must feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge faced by May in reconciling her deeply disputed party has been exacerbated by members of your party who are in favour of staying in the EU taking part in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping Chequer’s compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage.’
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for that, we would already be out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I’m going to stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is on the rubbish.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied allegations that public opinion has changed since the referendum in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of Conservatives Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public eye, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up chequers and start listening.”
In a pointed message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” should they be in the process of cheating on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them ‘you won’t get away with that.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us to win in the referendum and will never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There simply isn’t a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Examine Exactly’ Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “check the presidential candidacy closely” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election for the Senate against the Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focal point of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of deadly shots at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told sports media portal 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions last season, scoring an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship title after his team leaves him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ stable order would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from pole position and it was almost as if he were leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a narrow wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, risking to endure after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back seats of the field and on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to gain a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri performed great all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double win," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign event on Saturday, which insisted that she did not pass on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter, in which she accuses Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the Supreme Court candidate.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement before the Senate Judicial Committee did not directly address, but commented that the Senate’s actions show that people are “ mean, malicious and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days, is seeing anger, seeing people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
No, we didn't publish it," he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein was touted the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein disputes that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her dementia didn’t seem to get along well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defense of the judge-candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that the accusations would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to recapture power by any means.
You see the meanness, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt if they get under the wheels to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by a 5-3 win in the rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two goals in the lead, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the balance for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard made up for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal was in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a submission by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the submission when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his balancing goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the half-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen secured his team victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controllers died after making sure that hundreds of people on a plane escaped the earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We have deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, the country’s civil protection authority said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks that come with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia has already been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, which killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports A Missing Person After A Plane Crash In Micronesia
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“This is a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby to improve a dock hurried to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the sequence of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old Defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he had received position data from various phones that showed Tellis was dating Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis deleted their messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone some time after Chamber's death.
“He took them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to start its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots in political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after “racist” SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misguided message from her mother complaining that she was “still a black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to an “extortion.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new daymother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEIN, NO BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her faux pas, the “easy-touched” Plasco flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American mother-in-law had done a bad job and she had expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 a day she was supposed to last over six months of the job she was originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she told the newspaper on Friday, "I know that's discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting them, would no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute to a "extortion" and stated that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is "in a difficult situation."
“You want to take care of such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal dispute continues, the couple was quickly convicted in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children’s book, would have had no problem with it if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its publication after his death last year was “bitter-sweet.”
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as "a very important family member."
"He was a very quiet man and didn't brag," said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington the responsibility for his success.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, telling me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly subsided and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who did not notice what she was going through, went aboard the plane.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears were running over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning Women Hanging Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridges
Two women who have lost relatives by suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent; you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at a low point, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to go through it: “There’s a huge hole breaking into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future in the Flood While the FBI Begins Investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this that he asked for, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then we might get a little agreement," Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "break apart" in the party-political standstill.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be attributed to the timing alone.
The November 6 midterm elections are only five weeks away, and if Republicans do badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide on equal votes and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-sug, relying on data from the South Korean Reunification Ministry, stated that last year 1127 survivors were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park cited stricter border controls between North Korea and China as key factors, as well as higher human smuggler prices.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
South Korean citizenship is finally offered to the vast majority of North Koreans.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the migrants to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks revolving around the discontinued denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, however, accused the US of sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for Supreme Court office
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was characterally unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been described as ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied any allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming almost and standing on the verge of breaking out in tears as he talked about his family and high school time.
He has also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated reputation murder” organized by liberals who were furious about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is biased towards Democrats.
“I believe that he has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way he pulled over the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so much: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge post,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Abortion Principle Decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person now who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that when she got angry, she also cried, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts to cry, tell the person she was talking to: “You might think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was awesome.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a men-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was pulled into a stairwell by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager I was always a little afraid of.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're stinking.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with them because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congressman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the election campaign was already advanced, she lay behind in raising funds and vowed not to run if she didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1000 to men, supported her campaign with only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and directly address voters instead of delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, so close to tears.
“It could have been assumed that I had suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit From U.S.-China Trade War
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new fines on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing hit back in the same way each time and recently raised five to ten percent fines on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China vowed to answer any US measure and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic power will soon stumble.
To move Washington to steer would mean to give in, but a public squeeze toward the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit in the long term from the effects of the trade war by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in either Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have realized before,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the insurrection.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, lowered his tee on the 16th lane (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He extends the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
"I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I've been watching on TV since I was a kid," said the 23-year-old.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-profile throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they’ve fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players performed well.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
