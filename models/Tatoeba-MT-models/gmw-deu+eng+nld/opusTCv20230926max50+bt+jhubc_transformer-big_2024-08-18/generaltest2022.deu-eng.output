The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it is not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions which I should enclose with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs $179.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to credit?
I also believe that children should not be forced to assume a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a look, help a little, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can determine for yourself if this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours while falling asleep.
Purely legal, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that’s why the psychologist’s statement comes.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is your discretion ;)
Please help me to find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot but I don't want to think of the title partout maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caregiver commits suicide by spilling food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously asked to go to the place of the suicide and document and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it eventually turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately the patients face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window another drives herself intentionally to death)
This confrontation of fear is called "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is so the rough plot I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this story is known to someone or even someone can give me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has over the entire length wooden splinters under the thumb nail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 drive levels are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read with suitable central units.
For centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 levels of driving at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses allow 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake paths as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC commuting system enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue direct current and alternating current paths.

Omikron: Johnson wants to boost vaccination
New Omikron cases are procuring politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the corona re-vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omikron numbers than previously aspired.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Given the Omikron variant, one is facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's get you boosters now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I sent an application.
Today we received an invitation to a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I’ve googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it’s either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email.
Can anyone please help me?
* I am a foreigner and I do not want to trample any official on my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had a non-obvious defect in sales.
How can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First try on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working since ca.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books via the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me this.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I am more likely to come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims do not let themselves be helped or think we could not help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of pulling the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, in part even very close to the tears, are all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's Next for "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking make-up: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick was relied.
Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, had said: "We still have some anger in the stomach".
However, she did not settle after the game - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the bare result, the way the show was performed was disappointing.
A statistic that expresses the whole dilemma is representative: the three-way ratio was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) on 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted very differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," the happy coach said.
"It has felt like 10,000 people before".
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money’s worth.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team's game.
“The best playmaker I’ve ever trained,” Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team, even the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and reached eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Luckily, there is not much time to argue.
Already on Wednesday (19 o’clock) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to you again.
We originally signed up six months ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage this Sunday in Leipzig.
But nothing will turn out of it.
The planned concert was relocated in May 2022 - "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent period also have to fail, as it is said on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their dates already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of drummers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair stridently combed back and thoughtful of etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent remains affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of rental levels.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rent market is still not relaxed, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.

This is an absolute insolence
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused serious devastation and may have claimed up to one hundred deaths.
The storms leave a 320-kilometre-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear, after a visit to the disaster area, said that everywhere the tornado was crashed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw her showcase #NAME# sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or returned it via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was received or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the German government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccination.
In doing so, they are aligned with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness for corona vaccinations.
He moved into a company he was complaining about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t get stuck in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can, too.
And that he didn’t like you at the time: well, it doesn’t matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screenshot.

Help with your first own campaign
Boron to greet you!
I’m currently leading the adventure About the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations are written, the individual files are devised and now I am writing the entry-level adventure and already stumble upon my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a carriage of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever comes to mind the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
When not noticed, the Goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank the carriage with three left and right arches armed with me, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If it comes to fighting and subjecting the heroes, I have two solutions
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the hero’s aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will later play a decisive role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll listen to many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
If you can then leave the receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

I am excited by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was canceled to start F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the starting accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and must therefore restrict itself to everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in the F1 there was again a lack of regularity with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, the two only decided that Verstappen would be allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this opportunity.
I think you should know such basic rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guess which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally speaking, Roos does not like the artificial commentary style, but admit that the taste thing is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses, which make both seem simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee by (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of restlessness into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes precedence over Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German sound track without comment has to get right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two stations make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very meager and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironically, except for advertising, RTL does a better job in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, it is also suitable to accentuate the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a décor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be to name a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated design and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflow or the like... and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards, the water from running out of the tank through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps
MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, then the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the road, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry... of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate them equally badly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly-chosen astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998) who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961, after whom the Blue Origin missile system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, whose son, technology entrepreneur Lan.
How much they each paid for their ticket did not tell Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his missions and do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would prefer to return to space again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The missile system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object landed braked again by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out trip of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner made world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and I find the subject in itself quite exciting and even standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I had already informed myself about career prospects before studying, but also thought at the time that I definitely want to and will study until the doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear great job opportunities again and again and the job is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your feedback!
I am currently really insecure and may be thinking about stopping my studies in 2022 and getting an apprenticeship as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have any experience, write it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why a post about it right now.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are those even before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Our Lady, which is called "Assumption" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week we had a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails that absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully aggravated.
What is this self-hostage because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays when we can’t afford them properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent so on.
My question is simply, are we the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will tune in to the festival by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, however, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth operation of the mouser and the new plumage formation.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON organic gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of poultry damage occurring in bird husbandry is solely due to dietary errors.
Since the plumage consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with playing tracks and incorrect parts see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the German Reich.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have worked up operationally
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200 tonne coal trains and 530 tonne passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928 six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Reichsbahnreparaturwerk Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseen at the E 94 that the work-up number could not be increased further, the E 95 moved into the point of view of the work-up.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the railway plant Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the hostage valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it happened more often that shooters stuck in shifts.
Then the Beimann with a hammer and wooden wedge, who was constantly driving on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and resulted in months of downtime at the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only one-monthly, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which resumed service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the Halle central station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 as a museum locomotive was worth preserving.
In 1979, the first external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
At the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is supervised by museums.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational reworking of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five driving motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side lines until 1945, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig as a central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks on the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusted, with playing traces, basement smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The center bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct of the mold, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Home fire with two lightly injured and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has been incurred, the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was deliberately set on fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
It will arrive much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To demolish fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccine.
A friend’s illness had moved him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has released a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I get vaccinated to counteract these false rumors".
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe COVID-19 disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask about the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear can be difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was released in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I'm not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
There is a priority in Germany when vaccinating the vaccine.
In the meantime, the priority has been lifted for a long time - and the biontech chief has been vaccinated three times, according to his own data.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire broke out on Friday evening with 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power units were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale fault could finally be completely remedied in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology division, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, since the Westnetz-monteurs were initially only able to put some cables back into operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Electricity flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear, according to Westnetz, in the substation Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply will stand again.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually switched on from 9.30 a.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the most recently affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been in service.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens in their neighbourhood take care of elderly or single people and communicate with local fire brigade equipment houses if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was on the installation and operation of emergency power generators, especially the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary places of care in schools were set up for those people who could not provide themselves or who need power-dependent medical devices or who are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay it in euros?
It is the blanket #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
However, I cannot mount the base on the table top.
This is custom #name#.
There are 3 explanations of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it would not be suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Do you send me the return receipt by e-mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree
Nordic combination: Combinator Riiber wins
The German Nordic combinators Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to give themselves to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big advantage after ski jumping in the trail.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both remade s and use the version 4.5...
You may have heard of problems more often.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be erroneous they report to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly along the line.
Slight overlap of the ink layers later ensures a uniform surface area.
Avoid swiping back and forth quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal loops can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for one day before you install them.
The models achieve true to the original appearance through the decals or decals.
From government marks on airplanes to ship names to trim strips and marks on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easily accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpickers are time, patience and a calm hand when sticking.
Cut each needed decal individually and set it right for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you wet their back briefly with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then slide the image only a small piece from the paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting properly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, crack or even tear.
Suction up excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and sign up and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you so much!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Child-desire treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
In turn:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first trial led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was billed with PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but these did not yet count with the PKV.
We once again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and received another 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more tests than we promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second wish for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have had to point out in the promises that with one birth the further attempts will expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We're not gonna order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously have lost good customer.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I don't think I can do anything for the chest of drawers to arrive at me completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the repayment has been initiated and I have still not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we can not find these with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find ample lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello!
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of stagnation - Belarus does not admit very little, but the EU feels like a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There seems to be a “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot prevail if a Member State sets itself in the head to do its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on the asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have tried again to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned by migrants in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit on the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a leader in Minsk of having attracted her with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania shut down border sections, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not set to have the security apparatus regularly slew thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has appealed.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had roasted to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars driving in front of him.
I'll check that.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again
Thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organises SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park reports, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were free to visit the Europa-Park on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoaster trains lit red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
Since the early 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesliga and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
The first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun together in the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not as originally €1699?

I had a lot of trouble with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord" on Friday, author Judith Hermann read in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Home" and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her doorstep.
I left the contact form yesterday to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your messed up chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake you fix and not all from our household.
Contact woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet been sent.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With kind regards

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like a Afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
I won’t admit it to both.
But Collegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, wow, then you're not as serious as Kollegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
Because of me, one God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just squeezing nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take any further seriousness than Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass to the edge zone without any typing and color defects.
Often magnifiers are marked with magnification indications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact magnifiers.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
When the optimum conditions of use are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sales in Schönwolde: Women choose the Christmas trees in the municipality of Krembz
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations with regard to the sale of fir trees.
Once a man was supposed to have gone home even without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas time a little funny, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise, I am gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
Both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo Dlan/Magic
We have a new fiberglass connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and used Devolo Dlan, which received and sent 50 Mbit with the exception of a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, at the other DLAN module, which sends out the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less arrive (so use a socket, which is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were similarly large losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" via the power line with fiberglass?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate why I created an account here.
That is why I would all the more like an answer.
When it's time to change the current account
Who would have thought that the first time would be rest with the checking accounts, is mistaken.
While many banks have used autumn to get their customers to re-affirm the fees increases in the past with all kinds of tricks, the fees for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group’s Postbank division – to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower exemptions apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free payment of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer headquarters, which even got right in the first instance before the district court of Berlin against this regulation.
Banks are already debating whether institutions should make provisions – in the event that the top instances also declare negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been named the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck with happiness - and is still looking for great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let’s hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula One went even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre contact, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport king class.
At the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen’s biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came on the podium 103 times.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've figured this out once, I'd have to take nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who had two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
It was only on Saturday that he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five-hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed slightly to the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd win in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place after second this time before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after finishing fourth.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the two-man bob on her home track.
After it was only enough for fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday at the German triple success with deputy Deborah Levi.
Two-legged Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded the first podium this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt, emphasizing: "It's not only pushing on, but there is also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn’t get it and therefore I couldn’t redeem it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Because of Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said to have expired, which upset me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipping only started on the 16th of March?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered would be.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
Do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one or the other is like that.
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - sometimes apart from that my dog does not scream or goes to kindergarten he is actually 1 in 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has gotten a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because the hand is in the dressing wg burn).
On top of that, it is cool and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2x week) which makes me very concerned with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid just has abdominal pain, I cooked for him and now he lies in his blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroke for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we have housework, which we naturally split up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I get along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just to...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental clues, otherwise I’ll pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Are you all right?
Honestly, I'm incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
I'm incredibly grateful, I can't put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my ptbs.
I think this also partly has a lot to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought that I'm sure to find comrades of suffering here...
I definitely wish you another relaxing evening, the week is almost finished!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But it was not confirmed.
At school, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about it?
You may also be able to tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something like that?
I hope the question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?I like to write in english
It's been a long time, then I'd refrain from it
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response early, at the latest at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Please help
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern (real world).
The past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live on her own, I mean.
The transition is, I think, also the grave of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other.
If you have any questions, I am grateful for every response.
Our little girl slept on her belly from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can hold out much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around it, no cuddly animals, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it be raised from the stomach?
Or is it with the face forward directly in the mattress?
You can deduce whether everything is okay.
We all grew up too and when my husband was born, it was for example gang and there would be that you put the kids on the belly for sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you only offer me $20?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To put it quite plainly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be held.
I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the policy of this station is now under all duress.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet station.
Arno: You don't want to be a running lithograph column.
What's the matter now?
An 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, this applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A Krogman who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploding rented rooms.
How do you think all this is good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.

Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, because cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and dispense again in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or fire spots and dispose of them immediately if they are present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the information of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
During the first heatings, slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears during repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can cause damage (flame and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for baby suitability (max 43 °C) on your arm strut!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leak, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during application to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents occurring in connection with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hanover 96 is working out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it does not work under the third coach either.
Rejoice in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought it about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough for operation.
Faulty display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite plugged in power supply.
Then I removed the battery, but nothing happens here too.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the mains?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it all in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
In the closure flap there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, riveted stably, into which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zip opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and store both easily separately from each other - and access it independently through the two lateral openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack half and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was waiting for the email from their support.

Order and payment was on 12.1.21.

Please call me
If you renew the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the last year went differently than I thought I couldn’t guess and I just couldn’t redeem it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cut-outs improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered luminous chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called “California Gold Rush” of ‘49.
Thousands came from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were set aside, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You’ll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, driving horses together, and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to beat your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to use your resources and build a tableau that is working more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players alternately perform actions, such as winning resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning gun heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prizewinner turns to a new location and thus changes the available promotions.
This goes on until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gun heroes and are superior in number to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW Mental Violence, Sexual Abuse, Abuse of Power
The ARD documentation appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
Our parents and others in charge must never, never, never, ever be in charge of the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on elimination of test obligation for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated people.
"We countries need quick clarity as to whether and from when for three vaccinated people the test obligation can be omitted," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated people is “not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate,” Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has pledged that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers’ Conference on this matter as early as next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me out?
I can no longer handle shopping via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Purchasing via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sense perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant for this topic: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the abnabeling.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic preliminary interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had ** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the $20 won’t help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver outside the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've already witnessed my life's thanks here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used as cargo carriers, especially in the European area.
You are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria, according to data from Statistics Austria.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria every year is not charged
New York gets MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

In the Eastern Conference final, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn’t that good anymore, but I get it.
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received by me.
Would you please check it out?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is part of Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Now is the time.
We will tell you where you can get another Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller, which can be used to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and the distortion.
The POWER LEVEL controller even allows you to flush a power reserve if it is outrageously loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or during direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would also be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
The negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing, according to Iranian data.
“Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues to be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Viennese talks to revive the agreement were continued after just under a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia take part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to be above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value on Sunday was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new Sars-CoV-2 virus infections and 16 other infection-related deaths were reported within one day.
200 people with severe COVID-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Report delays may occur on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and hardly ever get behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and send it to the post office, wasn't it?
I don't have to click/specify/fill here?
This is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a shame in my opinion.
It's time for change
###MBundestag are greeted by me, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of MBundestag you can see one thing: it is not existent.
We got into a winter starch and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
For the most part, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we generally stand out.
In the last few days, the impression has been made that many people here are still having fun on MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around MBundestag is asked which one wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, heap of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone to participate once again, only in this way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server, on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How should we act outwards in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but what’s not bad, we end up having the discord.
If you want and have time, come on the Discord, work with us and let us make democratic decisions about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also pretty sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will remove the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup date.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She has lived vegetarian for a while, but she rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I replied honestly without much thought.
And I thought for a long time that I would support the welfare of animals as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal cruelty.
That’s why I decided to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that on her side there was dissatisfaction, she then defended vegetarianism and meant to know where her meat came from and to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly stuck in a corner and conflicts arise without which you would put it on.
Greetings to a harmonious vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, this can’t be changed.
Please give me an alternative pickup date.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly to be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the number of missions is constantly rising: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however have synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

First of all, thank you for presenting yourself to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, further I do not want to go into it!
I always find the question of the right and the left very simplified.
Basically, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in special uniform and weapons wear people right of conservative magically put on it should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course difficult to deal with the lived reality is of course also clear, because you have, of course, besides the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and with that I do not mean this not even to the exaggerated female cliché gays, but this is not to you.
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it sounds strange to me in my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. are proud of Germany and feel rather less caught up by excessive leftist politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or means to make them right, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, that they are openly allowed to say their opinion there or even openly forging any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often on duty abroad often start to flatten out due to negative experiences and also sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-wing contemplatives meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such a thing is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply intertwined internationally and that is good in my opinion that we couldn’t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
What I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #name# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more badly than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying, and every now and then it grabs me and I and cleans up and cleans up.
But it’s never really like “someone could come to visit spontaneously”.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly household just loses against work and unlust.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with your child?
We don’t have one yet, but we’re working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there is no visit and e.g. always fresh clothes there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecurity personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I find more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am shy accordingly.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told many times that I am unapproachable (which I think has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I don’t want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
But I don’t know if the actual day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it, and it’s difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about my code ("already simplest things are jammed") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now" / "I keep him from working with my stupid questions" / "they really have to keep me from being a minor".
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by giving back?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat mode with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the food breaks down the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The plumage formation in the nestling and the plumage formation in the mausing bird are extremely complex processes and associated with a particularly high stress on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A coated measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe poultry damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the new plumage formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the new plumage is completely completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community employee in opposition to the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be cut on our property.
So filed a case-by-case application to the community.
One employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your feedback.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Rapid notification: Severe traffic accident at Selb

As the press alert currently tells the police (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into the opposite traffic when overtaking.
There are injured.
Ah, okay, understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is quite good, because my dear head is thinking about everything that can be thought of.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross starter.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I do not call anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and I was sure it is - even if the conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now it’s holidays, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my working night was my working night.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter at the moments.
Now, even the family celebration is too much stress.
And then there are those rigid structures that also annoy me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like the rest of my working life like this - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and together in a team what worked out and not as a single fighter like that is the case most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I didn’t get back to the same place as now and I’m dissatisfied.
You realize it’s all kind of messy, but maybe as an outsider you have some advice or ideas, like how I get out of this situation that I’m completely done and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whiny undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only bubbling.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which has again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists in search of a maximum sound diversity can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of dynamics and string stop, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the amplifier determines the tubular character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a plug-in flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for photo strange things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L also makes an optimal choice for drone pilots, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
The eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared no further forecast when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, the state-run TV channel RTVE.
Damage in the amount of millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new lands of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
Particularly affected was the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, had been a peace-making "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gifting.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas’ Day.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of gifting emerged the custom popular in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially of the children.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made of Nicholas the Christ child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detail issues so narrowly, it is only the least of them that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the practice of Martin with Martinssingen and Martin’s parade.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of gifting since the 13th century on Saint Nicholas’ day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, a cheerful cuddly muddle prevails over the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region, whether the Christmas child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses who pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker’s business.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
There were shots and the man was shot.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police were not from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

In the Hollywood spectacle, they are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in color.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone makes this solar lamp shine intriguing – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself large preparatory work: as a solar lamp, »Smart Stone« does not require any supply line or batteries.
Place the "lightstone" in any place that is illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two included ground skewers provide firm hold if needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« automatically begins to shine; in what color, you determine it yourself: six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I’ve done this several times and it doesn’t work.
Too bad, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, then I will no longer order from principle.
If you think differently, let me know.

Pill problem
Hello, dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this stay again, because I have to take enough medications that I can’t choose from because of chronic illnesses.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples from 0 to 100 on my last about two-year break and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without flavors, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist did not take me so seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
My dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertarian bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodule psoriasis and the acne topic.
I also tried all kinds of foods in the course of chronic illness and stuck on sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed foods, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere you would rather not go looking for anything else that is still going wrong.
I already had everything her colleague semina o. e.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what has been answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But it is generally in large

110kV earth cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This is now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Class planning (EC)
Hello ladies and gentlemen,
I’ve been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I still have big problems to plan my lessons in geography time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the schoolbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy B/W for free (which annoys earth science).
It takes me a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and for me every hour is on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build that up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn’t have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a timely manner.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed.
The trade thinks this is unnecessary and complains of a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the perspective of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of transactions with items of non-daily demand, revenue reductions are to be complained, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
“2G in shopping does not take us further in the fight against the pandemic,” he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required a high level of personnel.
The bill must be approved nationwide, he said.
After that, each customer only had to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the tape received on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in the retail sector, as is already the case in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies last stood at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels, sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "the visitors, for example, at a central location in the center, can once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I have recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks awkward.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
What do I have to do for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range from 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire generates a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work on the movie set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when it is switched on, the known situation stands again - Very practical when working in the studio, for example, when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester the same with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for mounting, so you can directly attach it to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of lockers on both sides.
It has been ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilting joint is included.
Great that is also included in the scope of delivery a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torrential comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular response from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two winless Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga draw.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour the frustration over a full-grown season start from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN cheered and spoke out a "package praise, to each and every one who was with".
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now ranked ninth, still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put the Leverkuseners in the lead with 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"The way the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch again for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go ahead step by step and remain modest" and "go through the tasks at this level until the turn of the year".
Next, a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the agenda on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and place the order again?
For me, that would mean that I won't order again because it's been a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women sneaked off the parquet after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty glances.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection won a tough defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were way too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of all of us, and we have to delete it," Captain Emily Bölk said.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup Seconds next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top with the whistle.
Mistakes and technical flaws in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully kicked back.
However, the initial ignition that was hoped for was not.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early in the 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to play again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection got a little better and reached at least five goals until the break.
The only hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer catch up to an increase in performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

The title is given, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it is then partly continued in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless these are related to one personally (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is compatible with the vaccination..").
My responsibilities include education for vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the corona vaccination regulations and no reasons to argue against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (never happened to me).
Vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have one, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but who can not carry out vaccinations (maybe?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations there myself.

With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television show "We in Bavaria" has been given a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained unheard of by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And also no one who “has to go all the way fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg told the solution and thus probably caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate people.
"The skinler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian TV as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known word "Houdern".
This closed a gap in education - probably even among some who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice on the road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I drove off with my road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is waiting in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud squeezing and my rear tyre didn’t want to join the rest of the track at all.
Because I had no real way to get me a replacement coat and hose because of the day of the week, I had to turn around with half a bad mood and take the first best train home.
It wasn’t too bad in terms of mood, maybe it’s better if I practice this with the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I am facing a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tyres from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike to 14:00 120km torn off!) and who had already described them as suboptimal, because he has driven with them for more years on roll.
But if I think that I have to make a tyre change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unflattering.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tyres now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I currently have 25x622 on the road bike.
These are also available (apparently?) on the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike in general to other tyres?
The Schwalbe page seems to be my absolute favorite! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car hurled against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a central island and then got on the opposite lane, the police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown against a tree and the man was jammed in the car.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get newcomers.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new progeny and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but which is intended to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such a large sound pressure level almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the bundling which is greatly increasing too high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is precisely aligned to the listening place and impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamic that is of its own accord.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start thinking about the final look of the loudspeaker in order to plan corresponding changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, because the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate location, so that the cable can be carried out there later without any problems.
With the help of a top cutter, the loudspeaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° bevel in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The rear wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now glued onto these.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the thickness of the material if necessary, provided that, for example, you want to use finished strips from the hardware store instead of producing them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a matching perforated circular saw or a forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as the connecting terminal on the rear wall is facilitated.
Then a round cutter is used to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded with this.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly bonded to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
The following is the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill bit) of the connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow-out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In the process, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it is also loosely suspended there.
Subsequently, the frequency crossover is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the inside of the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Due to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and thus close it.
Through the opening of the B 100-6 OHM and with a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100-6 OHM is connected and screwed together with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
"Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we will watch the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans on the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
