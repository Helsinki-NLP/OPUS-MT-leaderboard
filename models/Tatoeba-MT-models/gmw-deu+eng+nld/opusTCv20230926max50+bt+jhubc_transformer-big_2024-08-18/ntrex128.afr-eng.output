Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to "look like fools"
There is consternation among some meeting members over the proposal that their title should be changed from AM's to MWP's (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that this could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stool and pwp means stool.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "admissible" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received generous support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus could be a headache for chairman Elin Jones, who has to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's way of working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was arranged in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly capitulated against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
"None of the two are there today."
He says the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize these days in other ways," he says.
"Crows are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people regularly go."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring even closer the day that completely closes these churches, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honorary John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "goes to try to pass on the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some members complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowed up with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's yelling, 'I'm bitten!
I'm stabbed!"
His whole collarbone was torn open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifesaver hijack. Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams battle with department store-type beauty courses manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty hallways in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if it is a success next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique migrating range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one that will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to their grocery sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to split the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean we are now a predominant beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has run away after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing-and-accessory brand name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The 37-year-old This Morning announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothing and accessories brand name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones got on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly, Holly's top priority was by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw from her was absolutely silly for all involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that inflates the most money, could drive the firm out of the bag millions due to the huge investment in products that range from cushions and candles to clothing and home clothing, and the possibility that its launch could encounter even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard words and then we fall in love.
He scoffed at criticisms he was going to get from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "camma newsreader voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' meeting in Singapore, that the North does not see a "conforming response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at sustaining the pressure.
Trump has made a much more optimistic impact in his convention speech.
"We're doing a great job with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to starting a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped liberate hostages, and caused the remains of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tide wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung told me.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it's not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's refurbished infrastructure a key point of his election campaign and spent some money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is thwarted by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sluggish sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced, such as Christian and Muslim gangs fighting on the streets with knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave up for Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team was behind 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking far to the goalpost.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it hovered to the upper right-hand corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and tapped once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea was 1-0 ahead at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal kicker re-entered Mateo Kovacic in that playroom with a rear kick before digging near the midfield and getting into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defensive line and finished with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the furthest goal line.
Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people were trapped under the clutter of buildings that collapsed the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, and caused burners of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was dotted with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, with knife-sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that could be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they were in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are re-entered.
A police officer has been told by one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to dial <0x40>MerPolCC, 101 or dial Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as a reference.
Parliament's statute of Cromwell becomes latest memorial hit with 'rewrite history' dispute
His exile will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sweetness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storming of the English civil wars was also carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure many believe is still commemorative.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder pig torn Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his van, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn blood-covered artery near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring varkhok open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bleeded and torn," said the cousin, who was named "Wu" on his side, citing the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're just playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring tidal rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastwards to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rains of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste flows and potentially landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause site-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially across the largest parts of Arizona.
Rapid floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep gorges to hit wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Total rainfall rates of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth lanes.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains will become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warming in October, with widespread 80s from the southern lowlands to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday watched the gripping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock has continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-flip turn: an agreement brought about by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was betaing her in drunkenness and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to meet people who are looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was always high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught Friday morning on CNN and CBS where protesters yelled at him as he tried to take an elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while CNN was watching him get badly beaten.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered living hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with the understanding that the FBI will look at the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority has requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the cover of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "totally ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the struggle.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge Parish's law enforcement office issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and area citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva resigned from area law enforcement for his " zeal and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "plashed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wayde said.
Volcano spiked as in Mexico City
As what sprouted from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunderstorms and shakes.
Social media images have shown how thin low-gas car windscreens cover neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake hit 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, restrained by riot police, pollinated them with eggs and threw powder paints that caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually dotted with tourists.
A brawl also broke out later in the day and police had to use their batters to keep the brawl in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cries of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
The tension is still high in the independence-minded region a year after the referendum of October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but participation was low, with those against affiliation who largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent voting at the polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet naughty victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressed," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have also been shot at some point after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed without a win this season in the Premiership and will face the forerunners Heart next week, which they are eight points ahead.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is extending their unconquered run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not having suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against bot visitors
Holt's team had to go ahead long before they scored a goal, with their bustiness that brought Rangers all sorts of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but kicked in front of the goalkeeper, then AL could only play wide after approaching and meeting CH's head on the other side of the goalkeeper.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead play moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga a chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turnaround from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow tapped wide to avoid still open play from Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly blocked, while two penalty claims—after Halkett's challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball—were dismissed.
‘Penomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this upward course.
Their playing style and team has been almost unchanged since their return to first-class, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense rankings while Menga kept on their toes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who they find in middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had a fallout on issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also thickened their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by some German Turks and awarded as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and notify his close relatives.
Road closures and bus bypasses are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out on Sunday at around 09:30 BST and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can remain in prison for longer."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the main cipher of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious disorders in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits Floods (Dry Territories Trek May Benefit)
It's uncommon for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings hurricane risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and to approach late with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have retained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Bowl, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possible up to 4 inches.
For those outside of rapid flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land all over the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its power decreases.
It is therefore expected that she will reach the country in the afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north across Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening rapid floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys, a 20-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at around 4:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to emerge.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered under the vileness, the rage" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered under the vileness, the rage" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and ardently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a jurist with a purely record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican emergence in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for this candidate."
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian quake, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival on the beach when burners of up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their deaths and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the coastal city was still shaking.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the quake.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach and dragged buildings and cars along.
Reuters was unable to immediately explain the images.
The quake and tsunami caused major power cuts that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuators still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees are hiding in deck-rope shelters erected in their office's courtyard, they have passed by scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the terrible task of starting the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and overseas personnel can only come into play after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we can open it up for international assistance, but it still hasn't got a status."
With the dawn of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute hovering team, coached two of the missing parachute hovering teams for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Some of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute hovering field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse on social media circulated under the parachute weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with one grey mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refill of ATM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons," the program's manufacturer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use army against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military power against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements throughout Latin America took place.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities draw youth to gangs.
The U.S. must double its AI funding.
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if briefly the U.S. made an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next major AI performance in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged past technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help boost the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically presented to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint Center for Artificial Intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last came under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in elections whether country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bones for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the field and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came into being from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small lift and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a lot of necessary investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said in a statement.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for a pro-Western government's policy since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goaltender received an announcement at the beginning of the series at the midfield.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goalkeeper.
He then pushed a deed to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," city manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest goal angle.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 pm. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which have a one-match lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least a promotional spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point of me this year will face.
Why don't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to having Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing workout on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed are 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump to hold a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican emergence in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big – I don’t stand, but I actually stand and that’s why I fight for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, who they have to walk over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and frivolous and false."
He referred to the name of Senate Judicial Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who had received heavy blows from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you leave the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one - it was really weak body language - the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It's intolerable to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour Party MPs who have been told that we’re not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party MP, that's exactly what Freeday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlier, more benevolent" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there follows a tirade of scams on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes scary.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken, and that I will then be "okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school lapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never been in the middle of my career, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country setting off on a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether or not their members of the Labour Party are: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political benefit will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late-threes may have slightly skewed the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still unconquered, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honour to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, targeted by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before he, just before rest time, had a solo three goal to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, aimed at by Baggot, reduced the lag to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott worn on a portable, and from the reboot, Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, aimed at by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of press game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took Climo to death without the ball, and from the penalty stand, MacPherson squeezed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr loose ground.
Climo meant it, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal kick and sent Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to tackle new career in restaurant industry
Still Game star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's " thriving restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': land-enclosed Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a masonry-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon were plastered with the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – in addition to the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has a lot that depends on Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few will change if they do.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last demonstration shows that the case was "not complicated," says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's case, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric tapped any remaining Chilean kindness, she indicated.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks again at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold close talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political stool.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"This is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless their U.S. can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. captions to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking any meaningful steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about renunciating an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Unveils Latest Series of Big Headwear On The Way To The Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lawn oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the shelf that captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have pervaded Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their staggering creations on the shelf.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple - but it's not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had closed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice chopper.
And if you continue the big fashion statement, it's your happy day.
Stylists predict that the huge hat might be on the way to the stores near you.
The oversized hats briefly follow the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide rim seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social media sent another great creation across the shelf — a straw-beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clothed model it wore.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frogs and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zippered achievements of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent exam results, reinforced only by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 lecture schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have, as subject choices, the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons that employees provide why they struggle to fill jobs are attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
In order to be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in today's children's language teaching.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other will teach languages that are considered essential to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to watch LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening match.
But how many minutes he's going to play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia meeting, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently withheld for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you look at it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 pm. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below via live stream.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearings for the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main point of view of this excess pulls is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five gatherings are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Control over Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to name his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have courage for the fight to keep hope alive when entering Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, the Saturday afternoon four-game teams may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is an all-in-one sporting concept but one in which players believe whole-heartedly, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They've advanced by six points and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum, I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and another twelve that are played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a bit of wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the buff to the cleanfield and guided by his example.
That string of celebration screams became harder as his lap progressed and he sank a critical set to win match four completely equal while he and Thomas were behind by two after two rounds.
His set, which won the match at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You really just have to take it all out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all those players are talking about.
18 pieces to print their stamps.
The only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unpaired but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't like one track score on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one track score on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday mornings.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from these exuberant crowds, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can claim a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Prefer both at once or at different pussies.
It's too early to talk about the European Union.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short feats with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One holds over track numbers and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they couldn't even get almost.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep a close eye on because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and significantly took the lead on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight what some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, had a U.S. team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls dominated, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has offered more resistance in the four-games and won two games, but they do not shrink the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to have scored four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-game to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a little wind south-west of Paris, Europe didn't always get their senses.
Jordan Spieth who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two puppets.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point backlash when they entered the singles game, although Furyk's team only had to play equal to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem that they'll get a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "definitely not disarm" unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "meaningful goodwill measures" in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding reaction from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri has reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to nuclear weapons removal, according to which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes gradual steps, his words have seemed significant in that it has not unconditionally rejected unilateral nuclear weapons removal as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader drew attention to earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party were in this issue of nuclear weapons destruction South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "fire arrowman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy North Korea," praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still need to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "Applying sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there hasn't gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "bending-like demands" just hours later.
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to break down a missile site and also to take a nuclear complex if the United States "conforming measures."
He said Kim told him that the "conforming measures" he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalizing relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-driven "holy afternoon sessions."
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university's health services, said the university had decided to enter the course after it was found that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "studying all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he ran one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to strive for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal wins Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarge of daybreak sadness when Dolly Menga's goal kicker Steven Gerrard's incoherent team scored a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only handed Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had run out of hands in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers are now falling to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object appeared to have been thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nods with the way his well-trained team killed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score points after just two minutes when Menga's first layoff forwarded Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the back goalpost.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to get a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a goal kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Rangers didn't deal with a deep set of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-headed and sent it to Menga for a simple round-up.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his streak to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett palming in long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty kick when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TELL... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Teller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, it's about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to 'See' Robber' Cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject it.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robbery cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West started out with a pro-Trump mock speech after his action on SNL, wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was drafted into the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a lengthy action in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he sailed out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
I talk to a white man so often and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't broadcast, the footage of West's scam was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock for West tried to spot it by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the stage it was difficult for him to figure out what he was wearing on his head.
"They've got me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've been bulliing me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went forward, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment at least twice provoked an outburst in the audience and members of the SNL role division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication, "The whole studio became dead-silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme chatterer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESIDENTIAL BETWEEN THE SCARE."
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was merely "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is FREE.
"We too," she said.
Prior to the show, the rhyming chatter announced on Twitter that it had changed its name, saying that it is now "the being formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecution service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he feels "fairly strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up regarding the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is most likely responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is inborn and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something seems to have gone wrong with our kids."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of these diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the matter work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters sued on Saturday for allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are driven by "ultra-rights" experts and websites.
"Lyings, lies and even more detestable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters's office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false claim - was not at all responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon sparked online criticism, including from former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial bears witness to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently too angry during Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to elevate Waters from the cushions in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spyspottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-inspired film and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spottery franchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new executing opportunity?
In any case, the clumsy Johnny English with his outpourings and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything up for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comedic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculed secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretense of sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean, and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveller and international man of puzzles, leaving chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two fun moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English walking up to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored robe and briefly chopping the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exhibited but the humour feels rather faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy themselves with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perpetual thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a bloated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there are few in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she must summon someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some decent institution, but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English presents a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-amapsic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service and come back to service on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite like children's TV.
It's quite mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to his right?
Labour denies that it devises a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants company bases to transfer savings caused by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in the favor of the workers.
Changing after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profiteers" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make "deductions" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector companies to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Senses. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have shaped my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett diligently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls couldn't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its performances, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the money confirmed so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential," and pledged to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
"It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful because together we have more strength.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use navy for "blockade" to stop exports of Russian energy - Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from ending up in the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure that their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of their liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Moscow's "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of executing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view has provoked counter-reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it "serious" to stand as president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest sport," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren raised her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand up in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn't stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son has been going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the injury that our soldiers return with," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault on a woman, interference with a domestic violence complaint, and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court legal order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members boys" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignoring decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court legal order said.
Prosecutors further argued in the lawsuit that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy, saying it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems – not even all serious problems – facing people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nibbling.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their devastated homes, searching for infused possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-sized quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are treated outdoors due to constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he talks about the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I've been squeezed into the walls' debris, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Mobbing' with 'Propaganda Advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid insertion in the Des Moines Register - the state's Iowa newspaper with the most sales - after he accused China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections has marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to them equalizing tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war aimed at beating exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by putting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Contrary to this, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers shunned the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans estrange female voters from midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans stand at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are very high, and most Republicans are on record that they are already indicating that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s instigation for an FBI investigation at the very least would be enough to spawn vicious voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on its way!" thundered as they protested in the Senate entrance portal as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among swing-voting female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue to confirm.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect.
But Americans seem slightly divided on who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly or likely believe for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively joking during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's instigation, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath, testified before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, do-it-yourself lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it rests entirely with the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to launch an overall change, where all of their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross-Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Kol Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before storming man-only a field gun and knocking out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never stand, but something that's humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night watching Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night watching the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to battle each other, viewers in the UK were left dumbfounded when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke."
"It's government regulations that the content wasn't suitable at 6am and that's why they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," ja. "
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work out something," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried to offer more to our fans and just went over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a "inferior" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not go to high school before realizing that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a disgust on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, the true things that gave me the power and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he relieved his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught him off guard.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at an Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song style – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson isn't on the move and withdraws from Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get his form right to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and fours.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being a racial egg and working on his game on the practice bump in hopes of fixing what's skewed.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long roughfield always punishes the wandering strokes.
And as if the track on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson comes out Sunday in his ninth game against accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the hero's room and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I put more into the prospect, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastical, captivated, likes to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead will soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scrape with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail crabs," Bjorn said in the photo, after looking at how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and was National 10-6 ahead of Le Golf yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the dots on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
"I'm still saying I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: "I'll never be ahead of things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow is the individual participation that comes in the turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to pass on to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to do better individually than they did as game mates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Fury himself had been on both sides of that big last-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every covert word of it," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players on their way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle matches.
We set up our team accordingly and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counter-attack and faced Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the classification.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The German army's latest frigate would have been deployed in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to erroneous systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the sweltering post-delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from homeowners.
But ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships – which will obviously enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disastrous F125 frigate struck last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media has mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also been an issue.
It has apparently reached an unbelievable €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that bite the new frigates become particularly important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are on the rise."
The official said the issue had worsened over time, as old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bats' secret life
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano dwarf bat as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special transducers will be placed on the property in important locations to track batting activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand indicators.
Expert clan canals of all surveys will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flesh isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and dorm inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that's still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the need to search for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that ignorant destruction of a single maternity place could mean up to 400 females and little ones' deaths and could eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo closes rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "false news" and said people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus protagonist has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $350,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearing revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million deal to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will "forever regret" if their car manufacturers lose
The UK will "remorse forever" if they lose their status as world leaders in car manufacturing after Brexit, Operations Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to temporarily cease production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would close their mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us to not only enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's collaborator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "with another week" while the fight over nominee for the high court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible cross-examination of the right by the president.
Whether Trump will resign the Deputy Attorney General or not, threatening Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washington's gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of briefings is not due to a contradiction for TV journalists who are "effect-hunting," although she said, "I will not argue with the fact that they are effect-hunting."
She said direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president in front of him," she said, adding without citing any evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying a lot to do this and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignity advocates.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and with times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP has sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, heading towards expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also tightened their preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers liner Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before resting time.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of collapsed from just there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sidelines before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no details about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving off from Illinois.
He was killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 fatalities.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's effort to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's effort to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to counter homelessness.
The by-tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who push up prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a seal tax cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large building firms of keeping property prices high by raising land, but did not use it, and urged Mrs. May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking series of planned housing improvements, including rent control and an end to "no-error evictions".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
"I got the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that pulls me back.
"I can only do that if I'm successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by 'Can I make this club return to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it no doubt belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only consider myself successful if I could get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years away, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and St Mirren converted from on the brink of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says when he thinks back to how he took over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable living from it, and experienced reasonable highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person has to do weekly.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels the most comfortable I've ever been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, finds survey
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling bars' income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but restaurant receipts dropped by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, apart from restaurants being hit even heavier.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June only exacerbated in July.
Drinking-guided drinking places and bars fared better and rose more than restaurants had fallen.
Food-guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across-run bars and drinking places, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 percent year on year will be particularly difficult above and beyond ongoing expense pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of learners say they have a "main account" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who urged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voting for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having had a short-lived ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said just the time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, learned again how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers with cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company divided opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired ad to display the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, with many saying it underplays the "abominations" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"We must conceive and give birth to them in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discretely in a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another noted: "Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had always been breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another noted: "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discretely into a nutritional bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a great and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking out process and all its challenges into the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can connect with, we wanted to demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvis has made the announcement.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the shelf for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to fierce rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children in sponsorships.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unsuitable for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked because of its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even if the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "handled accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted, is "almost over."
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territories" from both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should be merely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "exterminated."
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "observing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of eye strain.
Since 2014, peak time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There is amusement in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and restore the health of the global economy.
To eliminate is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of it to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ruffled flycoat ("a garment thick of the hubris," The Washington Post said in a statement.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment's chief operating officer and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's varying cast and daily twists in the plot (such as praising arguing with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
One can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll stay behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs at the time and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Out-of-pocket flow after the most exciting mid-term election race in the home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that had two office bearers now landed in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb is facing yet another office bearer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after winning a nailscraper in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then resigned.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the severity of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Studying History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible cross-bombing of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia has cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
Should Congress move into other hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
This is a lot of axes, and I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is being rushed or delayed.
Americans are now staring at several such turning points in the face.
What would we do if Mr. Trump deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, resigned?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this paper reported that he proposed to secretly capture the president last year and speculated on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is convicted to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we follow those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at one time lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath cherries on that table carrying the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimism for Rapid Vienna
Rangers play host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European day.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they've had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there's now a feel-good factor at the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, put past season behind us and be successful."
Women lose their sleep because of these fears.
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal battles at the pass.
Get a health care proxy in place so you designate a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Also consider proxy for your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a windbuck when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed due to a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications out of action, relief officials could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-sized quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were taken to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific's Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit the south of Java, Indonesia is the most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-sized quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-sized quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which resulted in a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A plane quake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn't lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a female acquaintance's phone at her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is detained on a $500 uninsured sponsor, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decided" when asked what he was arguing, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently serving in front of Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had put her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds have died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people's death - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to mow pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, filed in New York's Southern District.
Both of these charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for extortion, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crimes, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and preconception," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "horrible, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnac," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being sentenced for a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were terestationed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo advocates representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a recognition of guilt to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbanker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to unite her deeply divided officers was fueled by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she will push through in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the demise – forcing Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said for the Walk Meaning Walk meeting in Solihull that he "wanted to throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would have been out of control by that time,” he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: “First ministers should keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farge said that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud UK."
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in downtown.
A few activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s an overall smart.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to ‘look hard at it’ to stand for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism from President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump came to power.
A resident asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman very upside down."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, were shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media at 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 lead last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 bouncebacks per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team commanders give him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the very back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes got a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver saw counter-risk-free leaving the inside at risk of endurance after a double-move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the jumping grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he clung to his tyres to finish quickly, passing Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He possibly entered the pits on the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team has done exceptional work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in Western Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you get it?
Remember her answer... did you lick the document - "o, o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a little.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he said in a statement.
Feinstein was sent the letter that outlined the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I tell you what. It was really bad body language.
Maybe she doesn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the vileness, the dishonesty, they don't care who hurt them, who they have to get around to get power and control," Mediaite said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie matched the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard beat Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their win.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth event of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came from a Kendall McFaull helper in the fourth minute at 3:35, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again hit a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure to win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was heavily swayed at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immobile to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he day it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many corpses are still under the construction traps while many can't yet be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters ripped Palu that would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is looted orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after more plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had entered very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the airmen panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said ships working close to improving a quay also helped rescue an inflatable boat to get people back and forth ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analyzers set timeline apart from night when woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night his death occurred.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's draw that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my draw was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information were erased from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing pleas on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins from political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's a black person?!
NY nurse sues couple for being fired after "racist" text
A New York pediatrician sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "neither a black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the case to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, relieved her dismay when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Never a black person," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me Maurice twice.
After finding out her mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice, saying that their outgoing childhood friend who was African-American was doing bad work and that she expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid one day's work for her and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing such a good thing," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple retaliated on allegations of being racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it had been accidentally?
"Your newborn baby?"
Come on now."
Plasco compared the case to "extortion" and said his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you just going to get a person?"
"It's not a very good thing to do," the investment banker said.
As the lawsuit continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and hijack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been furious if his job had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitter-sweet".
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his finite success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't an apple-headed man," she said.
But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he thought Paddington's success was sort of like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, Hartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She died a while before her body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was like unfolding.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head squeezed and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"They always said that she smiled and cleared up some room."
He gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the charts, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death had been very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It's a crack through the family.
This breaks us apart.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still undecided as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that had no scope - we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to elect to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm himself to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'Down' Under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-sigh cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 overlaps last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally granted South Korea's civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the invaders illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the staging negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they broadly agreed to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is incapable of serving on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histeriously" and said he was temporally incapable of serving on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'histeriously'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times almost screaming and stifling while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a ridiculous and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care or Roe v. Wade Act as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of rage that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed at my neck by an older woman - a cold manager for whom I was a little scared - who dragged me into a testimonial.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think about the decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would only give $250.
"Do you think I'll get rid of them?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry with sexism - that she stifled.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China has been overstated and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has taken retaliation in goods every time, and has recently hit tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equate the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with US requests will be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing is playing its cards right, pressure over US trade war over the long term can positively support China by lowering the mutual dependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have confessed before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focused on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation at the ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the raid.
Europe seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari blinked in all his laps and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
I'm so thankful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram, who won U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, conquering Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the cleanfield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke to a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time when we had a little bit of heat in Europe.
We've scrapped it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat.
We have been overwhelmed."
