Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, overall they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tip of the turf.
In contrast, the electoral director of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian provincial chief Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP scored even worse, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially with the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received for the time being 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party made agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it had even separated from the European Union) regarding a common government.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, obviously relies on this development and assumes that he will return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also entered parliament, but it suffered minor losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India for illegally collecting beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then for sure, then there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken out in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reaffirmed, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, before his partner, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to detain and indict these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received the pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter departed the minister.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judge over the wrestling around the seabed
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is the same size as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff team of the UN Divison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the divisional director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it on and on.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The bottom of the sea holds a little-known world, rich in natural springs.
Petroleum can be found here, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of continental shelf.
Simplifiedly, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the surface of the sea.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be evidenced by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success,” Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas, has recently come to an international echo.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
In the future, the profit they will receive from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold-digging land," says Director Mikulka, adding that "the individual areas of the seabed are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, granted it the status of a so-called " groundbreaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concreteness as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary scheme that, according to legend, brought to life the golems.
German special forces were on site during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming known.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the pilot staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Office were at the site of liberation.
As spokesmen for the ministries further said on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed, however, because the hostages ran their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany in order to involve them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged back and forth.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until recently, as did the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets almost fail.
The Dow Jones went into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MEPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
Even in the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure became known, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
For the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire to travel remains untroubled, according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded an increase in sales of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the revenue growth of travel agencies for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these results are figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates it for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the US in particular is in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking increase is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic areas among the Germans are particularly sought after destinations.
Package travel in particular was high on track, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will again increase compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from litre jars and celebrities in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers rush on us and cut the memory cards fully - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap-dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Weißwurst equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited until now.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I would have tied the apron wrongly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right pardoned, widowed at the back."
Secretly I fry the bow from the back to the left.
"Fit," he said and laughed.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch out the naked back to an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "oooooo".
He told me this after he emptied himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbieslers".
Others are not fortunate enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
You can't see who's lying under the tarpaulin in the promille coffin.
"These are the ones that goartakers pack," one of the paramedics called me upon request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in invading deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial aspiration.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building collapsed.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose westernmost access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-stroke in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans lagged during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, largely overlooked by history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all to the east of it, in order to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city for the new secular state project to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP’s main office, a specially crafted, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure, in an evolving suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle-class managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey and its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There is not either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could be forced to decide at some point," I asked.
"Turkey," he said, "would not have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in a figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the same railway tracks eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never faded away for years.
How many times did death make us “let the music speak for itself”?
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never sovereign but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by anyone – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply went “to peddle with one or two well-known showhorses in the world.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA, and a doctorate degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.

An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical subtleties that allow for even more comfortable driving and saving on gasoline.
Changes ahead of the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the aim is to emphasize the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also over the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the head of the brand hopes to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% year-on-year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the release of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 metres, which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, with its public presentation taking place in Valencia for the first time in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading space, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time delivers high-torque performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
“Auto-Bee” that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight dates back to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee’s facet eyes, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which allows her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding collision
"The moment obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the beehive and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90o or even greater angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it weren’t, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, but also not oversized; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide it to the destination while driving, while avoiding the obstacles along the way.
She trembles before being charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to prevent U.S. citizens from getting involved in mortgage histories of allegedly viable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for internet surfers: “Bad Credit Hotel,” it says.
Or maybe, the “hotel of bad credit” or mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house

Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into their company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation attributable to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the price value of the share as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley’s share dropped by 6.79% to $23.07 at 5 p.m. GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, General Director of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, said in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves."
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged within a given period of time at more than 50% above the selling value, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to leverage investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a group press spokesperson refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payability ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said he had “significantly” lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch as their stock market price declined by half, while the price of insolvency insurance rose.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survival’ of Wall Street’s major investment banks following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic re-established around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Evo Morales and equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was that third party who this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, chose the plan of a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the vote, 64% voted “yes” in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'yes', predicting him 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, by the way, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence under the observational detachment of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the "new socialism" for which the President is campaigning.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from foreign currencies that send emigrants to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also intends to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and intact manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport around 3.30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to talk to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all "best health" and the kidnappers "were not paid a ransom," Egypt's Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna said on the roll field.
After being captured on September 19 during a SUV safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special forces, two helicopters aboard, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"On both sides, shots were fired and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled," said the person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is currently, on the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces,” he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a off-road vehicle during a patrol, which included the kidnappers, six of whom were killed, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that starve to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making 3.5 million euros available solely for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all administrative districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, save with a few dollars the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The stocks of Fortis started a steep descent last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The Institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the $700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the decline of the Fortis stocks.
On Monday, however, the prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party was found with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, sought reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, and the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branches, but it also names its own leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will entrust the fox to the chickens" - quoted by the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees as well as the payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and if the risk is assessed too high, the insurance is not even concluded.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer’s identification number, he retrieves the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers from and what his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the aforementioned are not.
For the purpose of querying and processing the data, own societies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and combine them with the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, this was the main topic among other global problems at the Ninth Summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian Summit is also taking place, which will mainly discuss cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic major power that should be given more voices and voices in international affairs, member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to a good 100 billion euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be encouraged in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the number one partner of India, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the terrorism that both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU underlined that it would stick to its energy and climate programme, which is to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives on publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is declining in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Billionaire Steve Fossett’s small plane disappeared a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane has been localized, and a force has been sent out, and now we have the certainty that it is the plane Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (Ntsb) noted that just hours after the plane was sighted, a crew was dispatched who identified the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett launched a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal belongings were also found in California, near the Nevada border, by a couple close to their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by an airplane.
Among his several records is an altitude of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A SUV that falls out of traditional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
It is precisely because of its exceptional characteristics that the presentation of the SUV Glk will be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October.
For example, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to assemble itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of author advertising into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from Triveneto – now they risk ban on stadiums
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has been following the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing milieu.
The conveyors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia came along.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear; however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it now came to a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or in the riots identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thank goodness.
But now, of course, there is a fear of imitators, which could follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be quenched immediately, and that such behavior under no circumstances gives the opportunity to justify it," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the aisle, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
While it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, the behavior of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country of their deed.
So far, this group had been in control, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also speak of the whistles during the hymn Mamelis: this too is not a crime, but let me, because the education is missing...".
