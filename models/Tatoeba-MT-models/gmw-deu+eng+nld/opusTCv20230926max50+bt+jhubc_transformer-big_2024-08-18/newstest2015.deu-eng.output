The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also hoping for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Olds After Fast Motorcycle Hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before taking off to the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal as well as ruthless driving.
He is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she “was unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
“Just like unions die, middle-class jobs die too,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Authorization Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue for justice in a civil court - and to receive damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to union in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their trade unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would replace Adolf Hitler’s fascism with a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting this right or aimed at reducing it are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to form a union - and to allow this union to participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have been under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to re-emerge the American ideal, which means that the working people must have the right to unite and to become heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say probably would have led to the closure of all five of the state’s abortion clinics.
This measure, brought into law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in compliance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his ruling.
Within one month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying that doctors thus gained more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are avoiding an insidious law that wants to take away their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Anti-abortion advocates oppose that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient entry rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would stop performing the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient ID rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homage for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances, she suggested as a possible remedy an intensification of the service of inflicted doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate among women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowners numbers
The decline along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under 35 could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds per year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products” according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting pre-gardens for parking purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, where an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put into sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens doesn’t mean people can’t pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said, "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state television channel PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but now sends again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he rejected it.
The army of the country, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, "to waste time without using force."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already cleaned up more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May parliamentary election last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy business manager and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries spied on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence agency, Ankara, caused much more annoying reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced before 6 pm to 9 pm applies to all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the German Locomotive Leaders’ Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the Mallorca prosecutor’s office.
The head of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was detained by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located, after allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the Mallorca Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners said the authorities’ nephews’ economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a sacrificial Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the unlawful behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the felatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000) together.
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8pm and provided nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The windy weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go through.
At that time, wind surges reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to take off on a second approach and finally set off at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently led to delays in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: It’s time to network big
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switching centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I’m writing this, my look falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, yes applies to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typos: electronic) Sector the rule that today's world first is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, for example, you just say that you basically reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pushing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week once again shows us our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who used to blindly master washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out in front of him with unbelievably vain expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should one talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quarks?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should network our house as we please.
So that the yogurt re-orders itself, so that the fire alarm informs us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our early arrival...?
Yes, however, this requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say to her loudly "sucking!" - and at home the vacuum robot goes off.
I'm crazy.
Everything goes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring", an industry expert rumbles, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, which is of no use, because we are in traffic jams.
We also know from daily practice that when a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar bombings descended on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel marked by rocket launch holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed pomegranate splinters from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of the kibbutz Saad and a native English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, heavily marked by Palestinian bombing.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ call for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
Elected in Saxony: CDU Vice-President Strobl calls NPD ban proceedings into question
In view of the NPD’s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU’s vice-president Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban process before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Vice-President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU's head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that one is fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in the vote on Sunday at the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had informants in the NPD at the time.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first central reception for refugees in Harburg bursts from all sides.
Now the interior authority has three Red Cross tents set up next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little excited.
“These Hauruck actions continue to raise reservations by citizens and give district politicians no way to constructively contribute to the humane accommodation of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, Green Group Chairman at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday’s RP data.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they increased by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending, where prices have only increased by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the properties for sale for the next few months, which would "submit a real test" to the market.
“Considering the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate, and the consistently low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to this, posing "like a general".
The style of the university is not that, the statement says.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been informed orally about the desire of the university.
The statement that the plans were not announced until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "predeterminations or even decisions", but that there are "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for access was also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current stand, it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future does not allow Pötzl to apply.
There is no parking at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the locals
The cr<0xC3><0xA8>che Bergwichtel, which is located on the premises and whose front door would lead along the access to the parking deck, should not be "impaired", according to the university president.
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the cr<0xC3><0xA8>che, but also about the residents at the junction to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parents' Council of the nursery, with the expansion of the street would be one "of the few natural spots of Coburg lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the cr<0xC3><0xA8>che about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking deck should not be via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would require the narrow road to be extended in two lanes on a length of about one kilometre.
According to estimates by the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase by ten times.
There are about 2,000 vehicles a day.
On the part of the city, they did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he is thus retired internationally.
Because the throwing backroom player wants to go on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander announcing his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing players and my successors.
But for my club I also want to be available healthy in the next few years, this requires longer regeneration breaks, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander had even had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass a body without a trace.
I have some health jobs that I can’t ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I realized that although I can control my head, I cannot deceive my body,” Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine “Handball Time”.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes rip, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospitalization in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to winning the 2007 World Cup title and winning the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in spring
Crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was confirmed by the Federal Statistical Office and thus provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013 for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist’s paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour of the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were pleased about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the Wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayoral deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend," the cyclists nevertheless promised to return to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songmaker, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put to paper in "Monks and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought-fetches for thought-fetches, the Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is relentlessly honest: from onanie as a gymnasiast to shop theft and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes up abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he not only influenced music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created “by subtraction,” as he says, “by omitting all unnecessary things.”
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, during which he targeted a tree frontally.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown up when I was a child, went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was that serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s time, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the foundry away.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Henry grew up as a child without testimony of his parents’ love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother went bad at the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since being praised by critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
"I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wished it never happened, but I don’t regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “years of award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “great parody of black people.”
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought to himself, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing time around or stepping on the spot a little bit."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was predominantly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put some of the words in your mouth, and then you’ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello’s last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical flaw and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
A little voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside of me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You play in a play, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was good too, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian – our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts, while imitating people over and over again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as it used to.
I ask him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give up on that again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party said "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shia Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and are calling for the resignation of the government.
The people of the Huthi have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
There are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army in the surrounding area.
Kenya registers officials to contain “ghost workers”
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove “ghost workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
In 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “ghost workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their biometric registration data is recorded, was reported in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the announcement continued.
“This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government – thus eliminating the ‘ghost workers’,” said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be brought to court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was reported by a court spokesperson on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years, he served as a school principal, 23 of whom were in charge.
From this period Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his aspiration to see people in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, he became interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
This is how Richter entered the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers to the nearest station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher position for him, he applied for Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Mrs. Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrading in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move from September 1982 to the present building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had additionally built a workshop and during the expansion in 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who had responded to a lecture of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always work." Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter’s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students struggled, he did not punish them, nor were they doomed to resign.
At the expense of the community, Richter had had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Judges maintained a good relationship as rector with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the unbiased judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as last on the CSU list.
But Judge was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of racers made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour with accompanying trot enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later an outdoor party in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert there by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bike, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, pruning, sprinkled and cheese cakes, which wonderfully mouthed the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the drinks stand of the gym club Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already re-attached bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Head of promotion Tobias Hagen, who has been on tour since the first hr4 tour in 2004, was only able to catch up for a short time, as he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-strong motorcycle squadron of the police of Hesse via three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a nice festive atmosphere and of course they had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly delighted with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was used diligently despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens who were as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists were increasingly mixed.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalder - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
Police did not make an immediate comment.
Among the detainees are 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly establishing an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Gülen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Yazenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud celebrity trawl from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was reportedly almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is solid as well.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk competing, hitting on everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps turning himself over to his job?
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC downsized – power, money and status outdated.
As the competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 per year, the British public is buying into the world’s surely largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says degrading tweet was not authorized
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official user account on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic District Attorney at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry's user account, which rejected the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and deleted it,” the tweet said.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was drawn, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who might be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with triple permissible levels of alcohol ... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry if he talks it out.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with directing the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers applied to the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the charge, arguing that the law prosecuting the eldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is often updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market to be "normal" again
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England had returned to normal levels.
Houses in the capital were highly coveted and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable action environment.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average selling prices at Berkeley’s private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by approximately one-fifth last year and were around <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “villa tax” before the general elections in May next year.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April Mortgage Market Report, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a drop in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise in real estate prices in London in 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening home price awareness.
The transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and as a result, futures sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April – almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, while sales rose by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a communication Monday before the company’s Annual Meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley’s revenues are expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts agree on the annual pre-tax earnings at <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Jennifer Lawrence nude photos published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from “The Tribute of Panem” confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and sued the hacker for “eclatant violation of privacy.”
Authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on photo-sharing page 4chan were allegedly procured by a gap in Apple’s iCloud online storage system, the alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not clear how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are really happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALLED, folks.
Let’s start from the beginning. *Wortspiel beabsichtigt*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They disintegrated, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
Scratchfully, he knew.
He was prickly, like an hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this pricklyness was a just beginning affair that had been more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older accompaniment who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were licked, in the baths there were still spiders, nude snails had left their mark on all the windows and believed that all this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbages.
It was like the house of a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailin, holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass, and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded themselves in the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs had long since forgotten the old song of an entertaining father.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just like obsolete the word.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have achieved, and as people choose the from-plate-washer-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels in books, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing big feet in a coarse-comic serenade of Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn’t been a very funny game back then, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of one.
Jazz, although not banned, was not played.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressive mind.
Although he turned 10 without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent—thankful as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, people were blessed with electronic talent, as by nature, and were supervised with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED, for fear of being indicted for firing, for fear even that the flames would consume them next, had been opened up with the Labneh and Shisha pipes-restaurants.
Each according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be sounded.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge charcoal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of her deck chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm wedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel perversely attracted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes as she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more treacherous according to what had happened when their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
- Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a fat fist if she wasn't careful!
They first cuddled - cuddled was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first cuddled and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the squeaking itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the power of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him move away from a room on the upper floor, as if her companion was looking at him, a man complaining about something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle – why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, worked on a brief lecture on continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country, where its reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be invested in the energy of the extortion.
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seldom felt despite the highly audible church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities turn out to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population cries when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicates themselves with stories of overcoming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only does the former crudeness hold rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute at home, at the workplace, on the streets.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to make the statement.
- Feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and those things that you call “backward” and “raw” could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to drive around what happened, when it happened, as if it happened yesterday, it means taking away the land’s essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to do," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others where we let go of our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angel's patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “if you call actions “mistakes” that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about that they would have left out their “rage” and their “mistrust” to “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as we do in protecting the present, we are talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there were no “others.”
It was a time of mess, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to argue, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
We don’t have to say anything about that anymore – we are in agreement.
And just as no debt has to be attributed, so no debt has to be erased if such an repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.
But to what does the past serve if we don’t learn from it—
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say anything about it,
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had been driven on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Official military officials in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup d’état to overthrow the government and said they were acting against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country’s army had surrounded its domicile and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Forces staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were operating inside the police who actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a collapse.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defense Forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Lesotho military spokesmen said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the administration during Thabane’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disputes in his unified government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other accusations.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Purchasing Managers Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced slumps in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a reluctant recovery in the eurozone and for the impending deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details over the course of this week as to whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“While small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying child, as does Italy’s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer applicable is also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely fueling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchasing manager index of manufacturing in the Eurozone from August is that after that, the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to launch some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed attempting to climb back into the smashed school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she was only trying in her underwear to climb back into the smashed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were believed to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were bloodthirsty.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to have surgery again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says, fighting.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe, and help prevent it from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians going to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her hand and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, in her turn, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is getting more pale in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
It was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They are just like our children.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it – I remember sometimes lying on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His painting was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she hurried off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and went to a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't let that happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences – I must say that’s not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and of course they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes closer.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgie won't go.
It has to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can run, but does not do any sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only intensifies my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaya, 10
The baby so poignantly carried by a special mission command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of driving over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of driving a girl on the crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismissed the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the proceedings for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the humid underwater conditions.
And before jumping in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s difficult to watch this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anaesthetic consultant, he devoted his career to saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and illnesses were important to doctors, while those treated were predominantly occupied with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently blamed his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it immediately than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance", but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from a different era, it seems to be scarcely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the culmination of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliamentary buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, the starting point of this deadly carcinogen has already been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there's a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was educated for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
“Of the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the past five years,” he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I’m the last one alive.”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to a standstill in the UK, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma has already been spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
Few people know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a “big health risk” with possible death consequences.
More dangerous, however, are the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, in which it is shown that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts, he says, are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, might have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work must be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the parliamentary constituents are more likely to meet in the near future.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he still remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had chills.
It happened all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the thorax, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and put on pleural cathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health was slowly improving, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came to Abbott’s practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the rib and breast.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
He is still being removed today.
Students set their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes, such as flooring panels or shed roofs, have contained asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison contained in large parts of our properties," noted Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that came to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So pay attention to how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from a doctor’s position to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very hard to take it all," he says.
I asked my doctor, “How long do I have?”
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism – breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the breastfeed, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is precisely the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos that is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital education.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
Naturally, it has been invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work as well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotly disputed.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
“You can’t cut out the breastfeed,” he says.
You can't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow victims four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he cheerfully introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, lasting four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to be able to experience the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very small burden was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesperson confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace—usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million insurance industry fund for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have granted them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many people affected by mesothelioma, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal from insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone by and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, fast action was needed every day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“That’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is often seen in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-stopping.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma ranks, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the Hong Kong electorate’s nomination of candidates for the 2017 election.
This action presumably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilizing to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
“It’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said Democratic Party leader Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that admitting public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too “chaotic”.
Since 1997, when the UK gave back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow residents to elect the presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong’s citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process firmly in hand through a narrowly Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most public-oriented protests in Hong Kong have taken place in several years.
Behind the Hong Kong pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general right to vote.
On Sunday night, within a few hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should take place only when all opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and tightened security measures, including police forces and barricades, were in place outside the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland intensifies competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressures of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it endangered business operations – Hong Kong’s lifeline.
"The protests they're talking about could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated – more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to the universities where freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to scour their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 a year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as outdated.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NIS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis, as available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize race issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender ahead of race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions in the Midwest increased and attention gained across the country, Perez saw white women’s responses revolve 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about women's oppression" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find a lot of people in feminism talking about being white and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now connecting the issues of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners for women’s suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to advocate for women's suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes powerfully aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to questions raised by Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists played “catch” with the problems black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are distinctly different in public polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are still astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes to the surface again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a rethink of the issue as an essential women’s theme, she just had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had his head placed on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mispublished and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the house’s exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a “unique single-family one-bedroom house.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profits are making for talks in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city isn’t talking about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a win could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a fitting finish for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a Belmont couple scored a mega-win of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked to enter the gladiators arena
Not only the gladiators were standing ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of depictions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troupe of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rainy break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and one by one sent his men into the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "Provocators" were in line with a rectangular sign and a short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who with litter net, trident and dagger competed against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
As the swords collide metallically, the shields crept and the litter lances flew surging through the arena that could become a fear and dread about the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era tangible," Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", explained the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at Roman Day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1,400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft once opposed the water and energy supply and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of then".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, the hot air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the clay footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office of Soil Monument Maintenance at the Rheinland Regional Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
They found the walls of an industrial building with a dare for drying grains and malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations presented her in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the arrival of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children occupied themselves with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards, as the Roman disciples once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and serve a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the nature centre Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
With the faithfully recreated Roman coach drawn by two cold-blooded people, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, which is proclaimed throughout Rhineland and commemorates the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and reminded of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the train station Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from Roman times, and a funny lesson is offered in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf elementary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often but no longer visible at first sight, are to be made reexperienced.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic affects West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely inflicted on the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola will come on the market.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people affected by the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: Only a few merchants leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export rot on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently aware of the consequences of the epidemic: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies basically avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the state's burdened budgets
The disease also burdens the already stressed state budgets of the affected states.
Rating agency Moody’s fears that their budgets will be severely burdened by high spending on the healthcare system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already stay at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations are underway for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. the big Böllerschießen.
Afterwards, the mood evening with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam" will take place in the large festival tent.
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great festival at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festivities with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the Association for "Societal Entertainment by Exercise in Zimmerstutzen and Small Caliber Shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had ordered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on 30 April at the inn Lukas.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting facility.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's records were squeezed every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club room "Leininger" no longer satisfies the requirements of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a workload of 2,700 hours, on 8 May 1988, Pfarrer Strasser granted the church blessing for the new Schützenräume.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work last year, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought it to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in lap competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bock stings, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart Suffers Accident When Returning To The Racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in with pretty good hopes for a good result today," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart failed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash track race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should be charged.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had moved into the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Cars with the No. 18 out of control after the exit from Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-loving young people wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn make the whole day lessons at the secondary schools to create.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now we are increasingly looking for young people for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to 12-year-olds, six in the group of 12- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff into the training session on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
“The training starts regularly with a warm-up program,” says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are performed.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short.
“We also go out to dinner, watch dance films and we’ve stayed in the dance room,” reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and still do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dancing, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
On Wednesdays, children and teenagers can enjoy lessons in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome at the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you are interested in Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, reported the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed the BNR.
The protest of the prison employees is expected to be supported by members of the union of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army gave up the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
At the same time, the army said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have reportedly shot down another fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents reported on Monday to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed for the first time to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine contact group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all the actors used their performances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a sharp breach" of the agreement.
“Today, we must face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, it emerges that “they regard us as opponents”.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A “readiness action plan” to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision by the European Union to also send a representative to the talks.
Due to the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply to Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel Speaks Power Word: Toll Will Come “Very Clear”
The chancellor is now clear about this.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the toll on cars have aggravated the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
“To be clear, it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come,” the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not set herself up on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government program, “certain parameters” are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being worked on.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also engaging constructively in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the issue, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the prime minister in the cabinet.
CDU Vice-President Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to tamper with all the county and federal roads," said the CDU-president of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the issue again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition allegiance from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure gait and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich Ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything took longer.
I could never ride a roller skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a.D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworksman since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has not been shot.
Despite this, deadly ammunition still appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area every month.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown on site.
An ear-deafening bang echoes at the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the military training ground in Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare site has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The company’s state and local tax burden rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenues from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in the property values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 — an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective in raising state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, local tax burdens for companies do not increase evenly in all three locations.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes in all three spheres (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are being demanded in Virginia and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people—a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by—in the District, Maryland, and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-party tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s cut in spending impacts on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city of Guangzhou – this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Li Yiwei, the deputy secretary of the South China metropolis, visiting an SPD delegation in his city this week.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the 12 million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
“It doesn’t take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre,” he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou hit with shepherd gum, but with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight-direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice-party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"The business trade between our two cities continues to increase".
At present, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The province’s vice-governor, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Necessary partnership
Guangzhou’s deputy party chief hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office for corruption allegations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administration corruption enforced with harshness by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW builds a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "Presses the Thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has shown hope that the 81-year-old comedian recovers from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all push our fingers.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that are coming to market from today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, higher nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
There is also more money for scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a variety of other things – bought the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their Bravour pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch, it’s hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching others play instead of taking control of their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 in the morning as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is visited by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have simply swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rains on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors set out for the open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they did it.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings had made it comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were required.
And all this across generations.
While some were lurking on blankets on the extra-carred white sand at the beach bar, others were enjoying a quarter of wine in the wine bar, the youngsters were raving on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But even with child make-up, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had their hands full to master the urge and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he pushed down on the visitors, especially families were looking for the expanse and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not break it down.
“There were more people than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success across the board.”
That is why there is nothing to prevent a repetition of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular vote.
He described it as annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid no more came to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who strolled around the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox therefore canceled their performance in an annoying manner.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tyre breakdown.
"But next year they will be there," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be pardoned the first time, but must be eliminated at the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to put in criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"You have unfortunately taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organizers have a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The final step to complete the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope is put on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge slumps pine
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so loudly when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went awry.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ripped out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing that, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got in their pants with a laugh, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to let the jaw sink again after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon be pulling back together?
The last time there was a conflict between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
The Board of Directors is now considering possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
Until now, the views on how the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could rejoin in the future.
This way, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the Burgfreunde around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye, for the Burgverein around Sjöberg the "opening and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since his death, he has been standing in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we let the club activities rest out of respect" This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think about how to proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make up a current mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find themselves". He himself does not want to run for office because he is domiciled in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much like to continue to cooperate".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl’s eyes in the near future.
He credits Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first, too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward.” It could be created as a “single selling point” for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving a bit at this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first is "important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, Fast Second Semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be different cost reduction options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented last spring, Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price they are available for at the campus bookstore online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com to have for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous editions were permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business you are renting from, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, underscores or traces of use.
Tenant Beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics nowadays can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as one can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
Sylvester Stallone’s The Expendables 3 earned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For earned just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored film "Sex Tape" only earned $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Easily Made 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children’s films may be the reason for the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" to date for children's films and described "Dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and this year on at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming Jungle Book film, told Hollywood Reporter: “I think the times are changing.”
We have to accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated revenues of $1.2 billion in streaming content, almost twice as much as last year, where revenues amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and predicting a "nuclear meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed to tighten the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, those who did not ascend have descended.
Göttingen’s highest-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, but only plays fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedoes remain women, despite their grandiose entry into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs.
Among the women, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
In the district league, the regional representatives of Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, red and white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The SCW Boys' District League squad - Torpedo II starts there - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel are the Red and White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the East Staffel.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women’s teams at the district level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd class circles achieves the target strength, the innovative and bustling circuit board will have to think about this.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in front of the city hall in Cardiff to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments on the weekend for us and spoke to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers Flying Out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushtroopers were brought to safety with the winch after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and emergency services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured herself on the knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were hospitalized in stable condition with an ambulance at Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcaster resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the prime minister, whom they accuse of election fraud.
Police said about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been clashes of around 3,000 protesters with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital information, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters attempted to advance to Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political resolution of the conflict after a meeting at Army Headquarters on Sunday evening, "to waste time and apply without violence."
“The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has fuelled concern about an intervention by the military, which has been brushing up more often in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to persist on Sunday.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially endured peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif’s residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer placed third in the table after the second win of the season.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week has come to an end for Rapid on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the exit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
With the second win of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the international break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent lead volley from the Sixteenth Circuit.
"I thought I was going to cut all the frustration of Thursday and snatch it under the latte," the 26-year-old said smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 Novmember 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
“For me, that’s something very special, I’m from the Rapid young,” Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-inverted way.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because the guests could have written in front of them.
“Thank God we have had some luck today,” said Schrammel, who was referring to the breakup of performance and results in recent weeks: “The results were not right, but the gameplay was always good compared to last year.”
Barisic even said they had been “better in many games before than they are today” against “the strongest team that played at this stadium this season.”
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him no less gratifying: "That we finally played again to zero".
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures have to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting eleven debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"You can't forget that," Barisic, who has lost players with Behrendt and Pavelic in the past three days, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to “lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical field,” said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One of those who is particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks for the team, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "We mustn't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably had a bit of luck, but luck has to come back to us at some point.
It was high time now," said Hofmann.
He said: “You can’t always see it in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
“They’re going to be there for me at some point,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-treffer "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been erroneously dismissed by referee Collegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren’t concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We did not have enough degrees.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner looked the same: "It just started badly, but then we found it and even made a goal.
By and large, there would have been more in it.
Under this tree there is peace.
We showed a powerful tribe at our puzzle presentation of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the depicted specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes by couples, basalt piles and basalt seas.
A little below the quarry from the Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument looks vital, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and, with a circumference of over eight meters, is reminiscent of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheim Archives and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what kind of attitude it has with the cast-iron.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Accordingly, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are said to have rested the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows graze goat herds actually again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, caution should be exercised when entering the stone collections, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place to stay for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a bit hidden.
Other trails are signposted, which climb up towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle that is searched for at our next task is rarely found in height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that the building counterfeit could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Happiness"?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy’s prime minister and incumbent EU president, Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative opposition at last week’s EU Special Summit, has enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reflects, considers the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also regarded as a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party base, which repeatedly opposes him, will calm down, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit more moderately.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk will be, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, thus creating a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been in leading party offices for almost two decades and who is known for her ambition, will face the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 with a doctorate in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which in 2008 merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita to form today's social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election of 2001 to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s over 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The talks in Brussels that the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, so there is a lack of substance, is counted in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltics, Mogherini’s suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russia-friendly course”.
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milanese economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is a trainee who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be active in four training occupations: electronics technicians (three trainees), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary and secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages as well as the instructors go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the inn are on the program.
The company employs 435 people throughout Germany and 950 people worldwide.
The number of apprentices spread over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshape has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a easing of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, shoved Sand into the gear in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “faith in their future”.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant trench fights and said she could not imagine the new Valls government going to last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for parliamentary dissolution and said she was confident that she would emerge as a winner in early elections and would be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise closes deal with $3 billion Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise company in the world, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced already this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to grow in the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed an IPO with the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise company owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mixed company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went on the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking loyal group waved near the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with peking faithful members.
This decision almost made it impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to make their threat come true and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which outlined China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Rongshun, deputy chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, and Feng Wei, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council Offices, were to be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin calls for Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government for equal negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: help the separatists seize territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with state-run television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the reconquest of separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary era of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas are "captured in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start in-depth discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined Russia’s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period gave a broad majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation should consider, after new elections, additions to the constitution that give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal footing followed a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday, urgently asking for actions to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to get to a point where there's no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andry Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal about Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a who is who of Hollywood's A celebrities.
The film city is excited after a series of unmistakable photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacking scandal about celebrities.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "The Tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne reportedly also made private photos public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that those affected felt “injured.”
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying on top without a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' told TMZ, "It's a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing more than selling hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Bikers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for others.
Everyone agreed, though, that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove yesterday by bike to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
He can easily hide the small muscle sore, especially since the participation in the 8th cycle on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) also brought him personally a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
A little noise on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the early thaw and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the good eleven kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-red Green politician from the county council - red dress, red bike - made some understatement at the start ("Every crowd of professionals, there's the goal!"), but then turned out to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also drove through the track in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, to trample on it immediately again to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself in the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
I also had fun with "Fresh Tones".
For the head of the Oberursel Kultkiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg simply include this.
He had scored 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He must be, too, because he was on the "fixie wheel", these are also racing bikes, but without gearshift...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, proved that it was easy to climb up without a bike.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who provided safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel-drive bully and quad, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge trail, only that he stops pulling the sledge himself.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that the route to the Feldberg will be blocked for the safety of the participants.
