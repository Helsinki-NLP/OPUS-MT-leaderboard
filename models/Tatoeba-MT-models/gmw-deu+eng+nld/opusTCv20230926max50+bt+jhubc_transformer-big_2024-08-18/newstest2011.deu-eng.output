The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor do they know the "confessions".
The new councillors of the capital from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has a little "tapped off" members of the new Council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they master the notorious slang that has become natural in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced in the passing era by Mayor Pavel Bém by the Prague political elite, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark with regard to the new terms.
At least they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina – a political veteran – also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term “golf hole”.
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and then."
“Otherwise, I don’t think much of snake.”
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editors picked out six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "biggest golf hole in Prague", "going into confectionery", "stirnacking", "treason of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised to participate in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things, and I don’t judge how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other.”
“It’s important to me how we understand ourselves within the framework of our programs,” he countered.
As already indicated, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor of Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, was mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" does not say anything at all and the only term he correctly learned during the test was "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, but added: "But I rather know that from the newspaper."
And jokefully, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only deciphered by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where this figure can be found and thus what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy business," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he asserted that he had drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that it was his own vocabulary.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be a similarly natural snake among the Social Democrats.
"I asked my colleagues, too, but obviously there really isn't something like that with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - by his party comrades called "Hulda".
"I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (birch) at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that too," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina gives us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is kind to the party comrades the "Grandpa" or less kind the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations in party sponsorship, is called "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
Thus, nicknames are the only one that the social democrats allow in the inner-party use of language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like calling him "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knob Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquired his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are branded witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They rather belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are rarely affected by this fate."
“Young and healthy women, too, are spared as they help with work and give birth to children,” a nurse describes the situation that takes care of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a specialty home.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure to stop the "witch pursuit."
But the thing has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov<0xC3><0xA1> was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum into her and simply lit her.
This incident was also reported by the BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is ignited, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to “expel an evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Women of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president himself did a decent job.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the President's bodyguard, kidnapped indiscriminately detained women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink absud from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant from Bakala: He heats in the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly deposed man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a portfolio with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased the rent as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is expected to raise 4100 kroner next year for a 2-bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he angrily taps the new lease of the son, for whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-voiced and half-resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they intend to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man is just waving.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rented apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-oriented rents.
Actu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning this Tuesday breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device.
"Miete 2011", a special touch panel on the touch screen lights up.
Just typed and the device spits out a license plate.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November, the envelopes in the Ostrava region with the new leases will flutter most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rental in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action is going a little over a week, that is, it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation as the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They could not even replace toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning breathes.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent until 15 December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of," the Schalter's officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," one of RPG Byty's employees says, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 are left to me for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"See me."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rent ends most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, the director of the RPG Byty housing portfolio and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents taken, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, in between, a few red glowing information pops up again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG, the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rents of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG argues.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not drive rents up sharply, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - first and foremost, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw in - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings originate, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
As a wise expectation, most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the projectants and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers to bring their demanding profession and child care together.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The in-house mini-kindergarten is funded by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies amounting to CZK 2,8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment have been procured and qualified personnel and operations have been provided for a period of 2 years.
After spending the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application process.
Fully qualified staff takes care of the children - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and nursing, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, by the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid the stress of late picking up the children from a faraway kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design was thus among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn up fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s Art Nouveau style.
The fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
It is only upon closer inspection that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and twisted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even look holes and strips.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43 was built by the reconstruction of an 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end he agreed to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade was his idea.
However, numerous other painters and artists also collaborated on the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, on the other hand, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house".
It is also said that at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia, was depicted.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed the house with a unique central heating system with venting ducts and typical fireplaces.
A bit bizarre already appears her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was in no way fooled by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the conclusion two years later that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors also objected, among other things, to the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the district's request to do so, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> made a request to authorize the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two further floors through Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s renovation.
Also impressive is Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light, as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard is clad and the light courtyards.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house the highest level of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The homeowners only decided in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, yes, they were also extended to other common areas and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist IDs get a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed grate? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
When choosing, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "warm up".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned on a regular basis.
If they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible to form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high soft-layer mattresses are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low-lying mattress with a hard surface.
"Well, all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their shaved shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, also sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can poorly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why years ago I bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with visco-foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This “miracle” actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it nestles against the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you do not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the height, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of reclining width, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, the guild master of upholsterers and room furnishers, who has been dedicating herself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and who also lectures this topic in specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else is left but to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the molding layer and the fine pad.
“You can’t feel the feathers with your hand or when you sit down,” warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully padded beds with mattress and underlay such as co-grown siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already happening today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, however, it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with all-round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensly important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially on their own, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable slatted slats with 14 to 18 slatted slats (laminates) (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay off slats with a greater number of slats, i.e. from 28 and more slatted slats, with lumbar support in the lumbar vortex area and the possibility to regulate the slat hardness.
Adjustable slatted grates do not include spring-skeleton mattresses, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This concerns a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips or even to be angled in such a way that they allow the pointed sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are treated to these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow to the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a pillow of 50 x 60 cm, as the Scandinavians like, for example, appears.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw sacks.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses, the new magic word is "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils - for example castor and soybean oils - are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams.
Soybean is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
"Bio means that in mattresses, their core consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here, too, you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortable warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to pack.
However, health mattresses are usually taxed with less VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to have this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and rust is not that easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is given for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but generally increases the sleeping comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
The fear about your children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can as well locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently in the traceless disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and terror and so they look for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective way to reduce the likelihood of tragedy,” Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market, said in a statement.
"I admit that in individual cases, it can result in misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we haven't had such a case recorded so far."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply discharges itself from him.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things when they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Although the phones initially aroused great expectations from the parents, they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with which to locate it."
“Today it’s the phone.”
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech claims.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, all you need to do is use special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he will notice that only after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, always the same technology is used as for vehicle location.
So to the combination of locating function using the GPS system (just like with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic holding them but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of ignition cords, to be ignited with explosives.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
In its justification for purchasing this huge quantity of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, this statement shows that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of ignition line is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special forces.
Soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to Defence Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I also don't understand why they buy such a large amount of ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
“For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible,” says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Defense, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition cord by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused as a soldier of criticism of the army.
At the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to determine whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition line.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s delivery of 244 kilometres,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman, told us.
For comparison, the annual consumption of pyrotechnicians from the police, who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherly Army, has been barely exceeding 1,500 metres for a few years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the service life.
Even because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords is thus open.
The Ministry of Defense is already having huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People’s Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords that they have bought so "cheap" today.
To this day, the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition come to me.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun’s winning placement in the “Small Entrepreneur of the Year” competition helped sell the franchise of his hotel.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he created a shattered house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented out to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"A large share of this license sale to run hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," Mr. Pytloun adds in acknowledging.
The victory has earned him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win at once, any visualization is good.
He says that he continues to benefit from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come to him at all.
"With some people I met thanks to the competition, I still maintain regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also reflected a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is given universal recognition."
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is only slightly in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victorious euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst of it.
The prize for the first place of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year was accepted by Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury acknowledged the efforts with which he stamped out a company from the small toolmaking industry in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages myself, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for rent in compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its mediation that it has also entered into the awareness of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to value the fact that they were able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, last year at Farmet was not only marked by victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool making products.
The crisis, which at that time shook the citizens even less, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits, than before the crisis.
For one, the company was unwilling to cut down on investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
It is all evidence that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The "Absurdity of the Year" poll is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll has become the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require excerpts from the commercial register in the event of checks on social security payers," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The purpose of the "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll is to examine all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech business newspaper (HN), which is becoming increasingly popular in the public eye.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to obstruct business activity.
"In terms of the number of income tax forms, for example, we are at the forefront of the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year, a place worse by eight places.
The competition Absurdity of the Year was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders have already been submitted to this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, there are also provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The launch of the competition at Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening that regularly includes political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the peak of the competition.
"Where the state is putting the entrepreneurs in the balance, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year, which still unnecessarily complicate the entrepreneurs' activities today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to remove nonsensical orders from the world have an effect.
In 2007, people most disrupted the duty imposed on entrepreneurs to have to report to the commercial office at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention of wanting to go to an exhibition stand or kermis with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of a amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation to report the second largest number of votes in 2007 – the obligation to report to the Office of Workers for up to 30 days – was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed it on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the conference room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration obligation dropped.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
“We want to support those companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the proclamator and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the “Rebell of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the formation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolat-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also looks after her health-impaired employees, who make up 70 percent of her workforce, for which she was awarded the title of "responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year she took the third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week working time without a proportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment,” said Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>, Managing Director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region, in turn, is concerned with the health of its employees, which is why it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also promotes homework for its employees and for corporate actions using cartering services provided by a domesticly protected workshop.
“In addition, we support the Foundation ‘People in Need’, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community,” says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the company’s representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses, is also worth mentioning.
“We give our employees contributions to food, to work, to increase their qualifications and to leave,” says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
For the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed in the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but they were not disqualified in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
"A separate registration for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Bodenfonds in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a currently taking place public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. paid half a million for this.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent activities in a public competition," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsner Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper Pravo, she could not grant further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated in the light of the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman of the Bodenfonds Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> pointed to Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo’s question in this regard that the police had indeed made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Bodenfonds, and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not one of our employees," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, public competition had the correct designation "invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the request, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, and then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was obviously available information on who had applied for the request and, since he himself was a entitled person, since he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to a property interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankota soil fund, which was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement refunds, for which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. from the Soil Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access magistrate to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste water fees and rents will also grow for district heating and in some places.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of their wallets each month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas will be up to 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating will also be more expensive.
The electricity tax alone costs the households a few hundred crowns more each year.
The high electricity prices were reduced by all major suppliers, so it is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic systems.
While gas will only be moderately more expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for district heating from January onwards, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 crowns per year.
In turn, the residents of Prague face a 9% increase in water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, in which the so-called rental regulation will be omitted from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to interest him in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky, which the father was stolen from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen are most often treated in an emergency.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the chief physician of the children's department at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Central Bohemian Clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell that strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman for the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> is right.
"Most often it's about distance or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Ms Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen-year-old or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital have long been no exception.
In front of the hospital in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the hospital Motol, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first introduced into the blood with 3.5 per milligrams of alcohol and in combination with 'extase'," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing about it was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in pushing with their own offspring that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not about a real dependency in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
Among those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Ms Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, until mid-November about forty children were admitted to the local department of paediatrics and youth medicine.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, there are three seasonal amplitudes, on which one hundred percent is relied: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I also experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n emphasizes.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after that, which result from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-generating infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few thousand crowns.
“Once again, I used this as a means of education when I directly predicted to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete,” added Dr. Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures in order to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS resides.
This is the first time that this type of machine has been owned by a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen at manoeuvres or flight shows abroad.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
When she physically expels the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, according to the Defense Ministry's spokesman, is not yet known.
The single-seat fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, were separated from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the department of the ministry.
"The double-seat L-159T1 was replaced in its current condition and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
He added that the army will not have to do without two-seat fighter planes, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, and the second one will be taken by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter planes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The agreement clearly states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
Last year, the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek approved the exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice, because it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a European call for tenders, and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was observed as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index fingers were longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already form in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he was aware of this study, but he still does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be “completely proven”.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are blocked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks is mostly snow, the winter servicemen were on the road in many places all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents by trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
Novinky.CZ said this to the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometers 91, a truck crashed, at kilometers 93, two trucks crashed, in this accident there are injured.
Also a few cars are in the road trench.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks clashed.
Drivers should leave Brno at kilometers 190 or drive over Brno and drive at kilometers 182 at K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are kilometers of traffic jams.
There was also an accident on the D11 and it happened right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car columns are formed, for example, in the town of Prosek, and the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow blows.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> is closed from Wednesday 11 am to 5 am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno there are several snow blasts and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling for snow removal.
So far, it is not possible to estimate when they will be able to be driven again.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be sprinkled with inert scattering agents for reasons of nature conservation, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
The U.S. forces have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only by its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and postpone the balance of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Your projectiles are guided to the target by a laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say you measured 543 m."
"When you press down, the gun charges itself and shoots the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group should be accommodated there, which have so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, in addition, the open-plan offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of an important company in the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based business director Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was again a "global player" that was won.
This is a “great location confession.”
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the result.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building shows up cooperatively."
The house on the town hall square used by Fujitsu and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago, together with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the areas used previously as a parking lot and because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conuser is the third-largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped layout - is headquartered, among other things, in the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry.
Amazon Blocks Servers - Threats to Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic missions.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in England.
Wikileaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is said to be staying in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists announced via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had relied on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents when the secret diplomatic communications were published.
Wikileaks tweeted: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers through Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman made research, CNN reported citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in the light of previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the statement said.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being searched for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian stays in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said – obviously ironically – on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, a battle broke out.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The White House said it had been appointed as a Special Representative by the deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that would have become necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information checked.
The U.S. government also announced that it would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and most active people should they be at risk due to the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatin and the gelatin.
The gelateria, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making art.
With a spatula, the Gelataio removes the ice cream from the refrigeration counter, brushes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can’t miss the “Gelato-University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also multi-day specialty courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to pack something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
But Luciano does not forget the icing of the national and even southern superstructure in his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately confronted with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own passion for experimentation?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
If you talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", you may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will sacrifice in itself, and the customer bites on noisy ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“Suppliers will all try to get you dozens of flavored additives.”
“You just have to experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs turns into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit ices are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano produces a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers measure the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice cream doesn’t require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only does the device for the automatic production of the base mass help.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns do not go away.
The Brazilian Gustavo hugs himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized rod mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa has been infiltrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now formulating this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked significantly on the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules are, in paragraphs, identical to Ilsi position papers and thus carry the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has been battling a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without restrictions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and I have thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently unveiled human connections between the controlling EU authorities and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, can be used as long as they are of high professional quality, according to a statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But you have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding experiments and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know what genetically modified corn does on the field, for example,” says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" asks Then indictingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
As in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
“Industry controls safety research,” Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It snowed.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators arrived and had begun to break off a large section of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He exclaims: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden coffin that was once a guardhouse.
He was scolded and threatened, he says, when he was in the newspapers in September, that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn’t do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the squares weighing an average of 80 kilos, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, some but also in the hope of being able to give it back in a reconstruction.
500 tons had been bought by Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest is already sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of impulse have long since turned into "walls" or into borders of herbal beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
“Wouldn’t be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road vehicle, taking a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and broke off, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he gathers his treasures.
He says he is the largest stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elb sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The quads once belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart’s Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police presidency, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal if you were to scramble something like that."
He is not rich, he is not rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual appraiser.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There is a huge crowd at the buffet.
16 students rush around for salmon buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they should work with VW developers to discuss the car of the future – and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going into melee and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they come to the job market and are promoted by others.
And because the universities do not issue statements about the achievements of their students, they try to spy on the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company advertises the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them how to get into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be in question as an employee."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new is that the students are so offensively bullied.
“Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to praise themselves and especially for highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering jobs remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even larger, according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, as the high potentials at universities are hovering and piercing, the guns are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Talent hunter Dykta seems to be paying the bill.
"To this day, we have been in contact with all participants in a similar action last year."
“Some are close to graduating and want to apply for a job with us soon,” he says.
In addition to direct bullying on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular are also playing a role in professional fairs in a very classic way.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Approximately at Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
He knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 job postings on the company website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive promotions are not recommended by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large company can often not offer this," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual leaderboard of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also provide advantages for job seekers.
“I think applicants are particularly looking for external assessments about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise to their employer with friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing with gangs,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has imposed a ban on this, and with it it has definitively revoked its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finalised.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which faces billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been discredited after numerous corruption allegations, is undergoing fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the oil and gas industry’s growth,” according to a recent industry survey conducted by BDO before Wednesday’s drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like the gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari says it well.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You're going to get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil swaths float under the surface is not to be seen.
She used to collect shrimp here, according to Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured into the huge wetland from a cracked pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation becomes apparent on the journey through the mangrove marshes, which are traversed by rivers.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat winds up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black licorice rods, sadly leaving occasionally encountered palm trees hanging their wedges.
Bird swarms, as they are common in wetlands, are in vain sought: as soon as the outboarder is silent, the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, spreads into ghostly tranquility.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly, "we are living in constant danger to health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region of the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the wells far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flown into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that entered the sea off Alaska 21 years ago during the disaster of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be disputed.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see barking drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell set significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are splitter-naked and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, some of which are connected with tubes, some of which are randomly scattered on the site, a fire is flaking: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later dripping out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel every day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which should also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tankers and defuse it on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is more to blame for the upheavals of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was so destroyed that only a deduction of the company would be possible: “Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese prove to be better.”
Michael is getting nervous.
“The highest time you’ll disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not threaten arrest, but a painful lubricant.
The soldiers, mainly from the North, want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
“This damned stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect during the investigation of an emergency-landed machine, which could lead to a “catastrophic engine failure”.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in their investigations - and now warns of a possible construction defect.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB authority said in a statement published this Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney that allowed him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had loosened and the wings damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
On many streets there is chaos, trains and flights are falling out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the whole republic has snowed on Thursday at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east there are some 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, the snow spills on the highways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the Meteomedia Severe Weather Center, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was therefore violet - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities also reported major road disruptions.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turns are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks by firefighters and rescuers on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information headquarters, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, almost 400 field beds are still available for them.
Accidents occurred on many streets on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was detected on a railway crossing, because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed a smooth road with her car near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already swirling in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters beautiful: The twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate yourself and then to relinquish it," he said.
Thus Germany’s largest credit institution is releasing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then refurbished it extensively.
The energy conversion swallowed up the information according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning for their dead husbands
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the buried miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the misfortune shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the calamity shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They kept silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were blown to half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to attendees of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit in with the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-examines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience may have been thought of by Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when he shot Walhalla Rising?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in a row with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies has already taken the guts out of the living body.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other characters can be ripped at most times into one or two sentences or a few agonizing death screams.
Otherwise, silence will be silenced and swelled in the creepy hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult cineasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a film has multiple target groups, only a pity if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", director Winding Refn has been regarded as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die out of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, in-eyes break up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and stalk an eternity in idleness and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a fever dream that has become a film.
And there is no escape from it for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly ties his throat to him with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that strikes against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, faithful to one eye, preserves something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes an enemy and temporary ally from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated and admired for annoyance, excitement and amazement.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has released new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is refusing to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
By midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters were attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quad with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that descends from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium – from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By means of computer animation, it blended in where what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from close up or even the interior.
The reactor had been standing just before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known more than back then, indeed the puzzles became rather larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence workers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a “supposed reactor”, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible”.
They lack strong evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how safe he is to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat answered only lapidar in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
Although the debris of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians rushed aside and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from a Member State directly after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it prevents the inspectors from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently reaffirmed the official position.
This is how the investigation of the case has been dragging on without results since June 2008 and "increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area over which the IAEA is guarding.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and still exist differently from this one.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are about, what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, has identified these locations and found a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this basis, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the quad at the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it later, there are at best plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces were stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the debris has remained.
A few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a storage for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria did earthworks at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, diplomats say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows the interest of inspectors.
Damascus, however, also ironed out this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna had applauded that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter is not highly urgent, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been launching so-called special inspections for a few months now, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Atomic Energy Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to think, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
The script she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much about it – but that’s enough for restlessness.
Persistently, the rumor holds that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav War.
Bosnian women’s associations protested immediately, after which some planned shooting days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but there is still protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female War Victims wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic – she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, their organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has given a filming permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating on the web, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victim is tied up in torture servant".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now the only way to make peace with her is by illegally putting the script, as so many before, on the net.
Nothing like leaving here
This evening, it’s finally going round for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are jogging with joy at screaming loud music, they are stamping with their feet.
The Bailey pub in South Irish Cork trembles as players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory prize plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a silly feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a rush, pull her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, while his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: as with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is now once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for the young, well-educated Irish people, for whom it has only gone uphill so far.
Loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
However, three out of ten women and men under thirty are now out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are a lot of letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, walk away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one, please, turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future arise because the government is merely doing eye-witnessing and no longer offers young people any prospects for the future.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her fellow students swinging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to fill the topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan has known how it feels to build somewhere else for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are raising a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home since he makes extra layers in order to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says when he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m almost never again.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loan financed.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he often hears at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – maybe that only makes us feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and see how life goes elsewhere.
He’s been working in London for a few years and why shouldn’t New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But there is one thing left to worry about these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walk-out party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results were obtained by the Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp slump last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents stated that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a bigger problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the past year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic output is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents supraregionally stated that the private sector is indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress for their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelans have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral slap
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electoral helpers who rushed to help the shattered country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Electoral offices opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless as a result of the January earthquake, strove around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the abolition of election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the electorate, is declared the winner of the run-off election by the electorate, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election had not yet been issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, experienced a wave of sympathy that boosted her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you re-election next year depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also directed economic policy after his wife’s election, often drew up budgets that did not fully reflect tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez government lost the majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disputes.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss that,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main goals, not inflationary reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently fined the official inflation statistics.
Can Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez now take a more moderate path?
It called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez may want to rejoin Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government signed an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club donors, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
Last month, however, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step towards clearing the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will be politically active after the end of her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been given to them will be squeezed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly cancel many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, that is 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and councillors in the five districts, which is seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election there were events common in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass parades and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
When a man shot him in the face from the crowd, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Interestingly, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided too much stirring up the anti-Chinese feelings.
She reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working class and the youth.
Tsai, as the DPP’s presidential candidate, found great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything possible to show that she, too, is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea-forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this requires prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a “trustworthy alternative” to Mas’s premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better at insisting on Taiwan’s independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas’s values are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will redesign his cabinet and the local institutions.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a re-approach only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony, where 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was overly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward, and with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory favourite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, which otherwise tends to include albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group, he thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The Classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists and "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati".
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivan's" by the National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt were nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt’s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for a recording of Stravinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpsichordist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center will comply with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others,” said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice reigns."
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides distributed fairly evenly, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” was a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is, in their view, a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously deemed necessary for life.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'strange' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake, California, continues to grow even more when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could deal with the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another,” Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"However, the difference is so great that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, adapting and growing.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it also survives in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs – two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis – disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities say.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide any precise information on the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unharmed, according to the authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s wage will be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “preparing” allegation plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way of anything.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually comes into effect only after JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, is heading the company, and the financing is expected to run until mid-December.
The studio’s restructuring began in May 2009 with the order to help investment bank Moelis & Co, the management that struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial concerns and pay off the studio’s more than 140 credits took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from scratch when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, will receive a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and produced an annual plan of seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gamblers can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law came into force, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, Webkinz and Club Penguin have a wider range of products.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming on the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children over 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, singing a note when you press on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher-price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers alternating games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel-blocking, it masters the Moon-Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-knowledge with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children aged 8 and over). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before time runs out, and it’s great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The newest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of lumps.
And he holds out a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming more gentle
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates, and gave orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their craving for violence – to impress the spectators.
"Still standing!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely outgrown the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood firm.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair with blue and white striped bows.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks disdainfully.
“Models are pretty.”
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with staring: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circumnavigated an improperly set up snack car and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police strips. They have been specially selected for their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly so, critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws using fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone as they beat down a protest action against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how to beat offenders without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a handout with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows China-trained officials in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," China Daily lamented last year after further controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a “really thorough cleanup.”
Skeptics believe the current approach is insufficient.
When the district searched eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonious facial features".
They should be above average in size - about 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," said an unnamed district official on the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
“Female Chengguans are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that, they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, would not agree to this description,
But admitted that in China sizing requirements in job advertisements are not uncommon for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this should be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use cripples or buckles here," said Mr. Zheng.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols in Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that so much importance is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the brief attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than just shying traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many buns and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies in leisure sales.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after rumours circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were toppled or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patronized that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers paved their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbally.”
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start arguing.”
Prosecutor Will Not Prosecute Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the allegations brought against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to get her husband to lobby, the senator’s lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal, which made headlines nationwide and shocked his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict following the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplined sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in their opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first revealed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, helped to lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an election campaign of Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over lobbying for them after hiring Hampton.
Since Hampton was recently still in Ensign's electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on turning-door lobby.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be a deal and a violation of the revolving door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are aimed at the government.
While the Department of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethiopian lawyers said the ministry appears to be very cautious in picking up political charges after a variety of defeats prosecuted by the media with great interest, including last year’s decision to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the state prosecutor.
Prosecutors are “obviously horrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” association (an organization aiming to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, informing him that the ministry would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me, but we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to end the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An email from December 2008 proves that after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "buttoning" at the Department of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
When information about this affair first came to the public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the ranks of Republicans.
After noticing for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped themselves away in the riots in the courtroom.
They sent out their reports of horrific testimony on Twitter every minute.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the verdict on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye’s lawyers have already filed applications to the court that explain the reasons for an appeal and that the courts will employ for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has resulted in a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of insurgent details, so that the jury was inadmissibly influenced by public indignation.
This objection could prompt the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The Chief Justice, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, dismissed the motions by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who is said to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there would have been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court claims, which Mr. Haye’s conviction considers half a century later, may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There’s a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes being prosecuted by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
For example, defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudicial when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her breeders, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge incorrectly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the public prosecutor’s office, and that he impermissibly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a ruling contest they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"Such a daily rush of media pips, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more incisive than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly is a technology-hostile look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to reporting, and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against 21st century Maxwell."
Can politeness connect the separating thing?
After a campaign of libel and negativity, little courtesy broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders brought no breakthrough in the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called “lame duck session”, the session at the end of a government period in which no more decisions are made.
After all what you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observance of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point-gathering.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of them demands from the other a sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partial passions that are dying again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, albeit only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, the optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brookings Institute warns that successful collaboration on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a pre-match, or shadow boxing, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
No matter how concerned the Republican leaders may be about being too high poker, they know they need to try to keep their promises, cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have urged so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and health system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far broader election in 2012.
From this point of view, the politeness shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Kleptocracy" and it passes on some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, as reported in a memo in February by the American Embassy in Russia.
Both the police and the State Security Service are blackmailing high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy—what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority”—takes its share of the money that heads up.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on his homepage on Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow’s mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador’s report, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and to conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo reads.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report further states that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in an interview recently.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Meanwhile, nationwide, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow time, will certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge to 35 years in prison when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, the fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization that is researching the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overrun the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006, waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodia’s Documentation Centre Commissioners that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would indict more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Center said.
“Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering together the broken pieces,” he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Department of Education's history book, which contains less than four pages across the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook, and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and covered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here on a tyre pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will drop a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to no longer collect weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of 47 Nations” of April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)."
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapon-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... We will not make it dirty bombs and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials say.
It has been loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian low-enriched uranium research, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Releasable Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-capable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
It is added that the former deputy government chief Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights-abusing practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero away" and reaffirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.”
"You just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "would not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as these are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense via the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any inconvenient or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discretely between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he had given his employees instructions to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to let the tension quench."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach to this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a hint that the government of Zapatero will tolerate or have deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be construed as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures could negatively impact the U.S. government,” he emphasizes.
The child killer confesses that she has complained on the Internet about the "mustsal" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She held for a year.
Shortly after she disbanded her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex-husband never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she started a different relationship.
The Chosen One was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the job market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to be able to do and let what he wants."
She later mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me; never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A huge kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on email. You see, if he wants, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes on a summer course to learn Catalan."
Of V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, in which she called herself “Muki, the jail releaser.”
"Terror a la gallega (headline) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, declares to have a bite of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe that everything happened because she hadn’t told him that she was a single mother.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica was transferred yesterday from the centre for prisoners of justice on Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
Compulsory defender Carlos Maceda said she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend—resulting from redirecting the PSC’s share of votes and binding the PP’s electorate—should continue, the PP’s analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections falls in May 2011. Even then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, in which it would have to achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the leading role in Tarragona’s reversal, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
Currently, PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the killings in Bombay, which in 2008 was claimed by 10 people.
The Spanish Interior Minister attributes great importance to these investigations, which goes to the extent that he assures that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaida has been "weakened" worldwide and "with their capacity to act".
In the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without punishment.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks on the territory of the EU in the coming days as the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistani Buthar Butayan and Zeeshan Thai were arrested.
They had headed the cell located in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
It is underlined in investigations that until now no links between the detained in Catalonia and the bombay attack could be established, although the author of this attack was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before Catalonia’s assassination, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which was “invested” in the purchase of prepaid mobile phone cards, which were later used by the members of the “commando” that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
Police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally submit to Artur Mas his conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, like a financial compensation agreement, to propose the climax of his mandate.
The chairman of the Catalan People’s Party, with the certainty, addressed Artur Mas, who awarded her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday – a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU bourgeois regionalist party is reliant on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting in his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duckling with the PP, but the talks Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the PPC party leaders are concerned, they demand that, in support of the inauguration, "all discourses concerning Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" and an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to that in the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum be held behind.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are concerned with the details of the negotiations on Mas's inauguration.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the retirement home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people.
The leaders of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot, Gerona, yesterday gave a press conference in which they showed the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés – the caregiver who, during his work, had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible – had done to the facility.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat would like to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the right and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and illnesses were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point, stating that "lack of action could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that there were “no indications in the litigation for negligent acts of any person other than the accused.”
He confessed to eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and that he had murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach liquor, as he had done according to the confession of three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they don’t believe the nurse’s statements, not even in terms of the number of murders that could be more, which is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threat Signs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points, which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB must make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, and the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, with only a one-week indefinite access being maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended “at least until March” and quarterly, unlimited quarterly tenders to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and send a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not met, yesterday’s excellent response from the markets will be thrown back again, and if stubbornly insists on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank reaffirmed that it would not consider the purchase of government bonds and that markets would collapse, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year national titles in Portugal was rather weak.
Government wealth management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets according to the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt gap were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government needs to get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the heads of state and the government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Prime Minister presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and labour procurement measures. Measures that sound to the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate any doubts about our debt restructuring capability.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it counts not only to be, but also to appear."
Only courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the CEO of Eulen is contesting the Vega Sicilia shareholders’ meeting
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not flow off.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company belt, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to get a majority to control the company's administrative bodies - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for corporate services does not appear to be willing to yield in his litigation for control of El Enebro’s organs.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderbolt in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The appointment of the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders’ meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have by means of legal sensitivities, fraudulent acts and misuse of rights the January 18 Assembly declared invalid," as official spokespersons declare.
This reasoning is the basis for challenging the Assembly retrospectively to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, who hid themselves in discrete silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a judicial assembly in June.
At El Enebro - an asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the appeal proceedings, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At first no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, the final sprint last November all relied on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull “in a few hours, almost in real time” can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly qualified young people, who use powerful computer systems to carry out analyses and all sorts of changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
All that happens is top secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the racetracks, are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
The plant’s chief technologist, Steve Nevey, stresses that five years ago, it was still possible to say that R&D advances contributed 50 percent to the victory for racing cars and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, with the technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots’ contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer because they “are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will open its own 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a 20-store sales network of 80 to 100 square meters each, which Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
As an example, the deputy chairman of HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, Helena Herrero, mentioned the converted store at the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been collaborating for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) and Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, reassured that the store opening philosophy is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry expertise.
The North American group of companies advises on this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop personnel.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive point of sale network was intended to "optimize customer service and the advice of small and micro-enterprises when shopping and after, yes, even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, as the large companies already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'claw' its rival one million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell’s executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a drop in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that is still too existing.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - which is the big challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks’ plans around the world.
Sabadell will complete its four-year Optima Guidance Plan this year, initially designed to last three years, but due to the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a long range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities – which punishes the interest margins – will flow, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their liquidity-retaining emissions will already be rolled down to the price of loans as a compensation for dwindling profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans.”
"We didn't turn off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategy is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "enormously increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in capital increases.
After reassuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he disproves the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be circulated, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo transactions and thus intercepted the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of fusion of savings banks
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta rejected the possibility of a wave of fusion of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish Savings Banks concentration process began, several Savings Banks insisted that they do not participate in the first phase, and they reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The bulk of it is completed. It may be that instead of seven toes we have thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process that was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have met the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unwarranted opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed unsuspectingness and nonsense" because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a exhorts us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta confirmed yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” in the world, adding that those who doubted this would do so “without deeper knowledge.”
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have gone through a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the retention of the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers, or the lifting of the 426 euros of support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, who has summoned the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of most of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although this sounds more like science fiction at the moment - is supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the cessation of payments by some countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been going on for some time now, so there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strong tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was put forward by the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it was driving the Ireland crisis and all that followed.
However, their proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is intended to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - there will be no longer the old functioning of the euro from this date on.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area, in which the conflicting countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to pay some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness as well as positive foreign trade balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would be bad at not understanding it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like it would change anything.
Among the possibilities considered, the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of little-reputable countries, is not to be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sports and circumvention
Tricks like that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventive spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed over whether it was an unsportsmanlike action or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but adhered to rules in this sport.
Part of the emergent debate about the case is due to a team from football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem pretended to be noble and honorable and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) playing the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behavior, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the infringing players take unwarranted advantage from the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by cheating or rule bypassing, because the bypassing of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither put in a more unfavorable position nor benefits were demanded for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually retire as well, and with this approach, players get a sanction and transition into the second card cycle, in which they exit with a card less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation.
It is not clear if this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions to make the most of the regulations.
In this case, players did not want to circumvent sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to undergo them.
They made a strategic decision without evading a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the control environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Special offer for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turr<0xC3><0xB3>n and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which supply the restaurant and leisure industry with Barcelona’s oxygen, but as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the large crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, the interviewed entrepreneurs confirm.
To make the accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Summer falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s, chairman of the Barcelona restaurant committee.
The representative of the governing body has so far dared not predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before they reserve."
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand by 25 euros.
A survey in several centrally located restaurants found that the evening of December 17 led to the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu and a total of 23 locales, you do not lose the optimism after the second quarter of the revenues again flourish and good, albeit concentrated, prospects for the Christmas business are anticipated.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus as a prize hit. It has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the rise again.
On the part of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with associations such as the Barcelona pub, restaurant and leisure association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, relies on seeing the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living" overall, although the customers "get a maximum".
However, the fun of partying hasn’t diminished, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Wikileaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns the Pakistani nuclear program Washington is raising.
On the fringe of the clarification and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program—that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack—are preparing Washington for sleepless nights.
The Pakistani ambassador Anne W. Patterson noted the following risks in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area under attack by the Taliban, the suspected dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered by the United States, but also by Russia, to be excessive and reason to exercise caution.
“Pakistan must hire rigorously faithful personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recluse individuals working on nuclear or missile programs,” said Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary unveiled by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is declining and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "Often there is no transparency; on aid offers we do not receive answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, a state intelligence official for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the Chief of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the person in charge that "Pakistan's army has to stop its tacit support of terrorist groups."
Searching for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning on the persecution and detection of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to clarify the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about the "discovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse facing the Australian in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens also assured the police “know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange, "to arrest him for the time being and hand him over."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case for Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be staying.
The action outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities’ questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was given the appropriate approval by the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s security chief.
"This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution," the letter said.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts her son's innocence - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, during which he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "laughing and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism campaigner, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be "murdered".
"Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information into the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is looking for peace in the ERC with a wink
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close associates of former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headaches as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start, yesterday announced that the more than 200 ERC regional councillors could secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss the president’s ticket, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reaffirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod comrades demand more from the President than merely putting his office at the disposal of the party, an insufficient gesture, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to contribute to the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will present to the Council for voting on 18 January.
Its intention is to guarantee Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, which in return promises to move Congress forward into the autumn of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that "polyphony" is detrimental to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s is an ideologist, the owner of Innovaci<0xC3><0xB3> considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which were in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he calls for a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s' team, which has already fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the quaking assembly of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress to address the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as infogle’s internal upheaval of recent years has not been advisable to address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors on the cusp, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.
23 Killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the count of MILENIO, there were four fewer cases in México than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to counts of MILENIO México, which are four fewer than in the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the find of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, a total of 390 deaths are believed to be related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots caused by firearms, the mercy shot was fired at his head and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the Mixtecas road in the Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n settlement of the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, land workers found early in the morning a body with traces of torture and at least three deadly shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal motorway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, a message was found, presumably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man with eight shots was murdered after leaving his house to do his job as a garbage truck driver.
On November 7th, two 30-year-olds were killed in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement in the village of Ecatepec as a result of shots in the head.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the mercy shot in his forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a cartridge sleeve shot down with a firearm of the caliber.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage channel of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
The emergency service searched for the rest of the body parts, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n informed of the discovery of a corpse they had discovered in the area of Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, their hands tied backwards and their head tied.
The man had a wound that came from a firearm shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, reports of the murder of two men wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda of the municipality of Tizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women, wrapped in blankets, were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, who, according to the news that his murderers left next to him, was probably named Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os.
In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding illustrations were discovered on the woman’s skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies were discovered by two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This happens to those who don't participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet were found with traces of torture inside a taxi parked behind the judicial center of the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and confined in black plastic bags, and there was a message next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China upholds its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China will keep its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei reassured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
In the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities have worked with those of the central state and municipalities to achieve the energy saving, energy efficiency and emissions reduction targets.
In addition, he stated that several multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which was introduced over the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another to mitigate and adapt.
Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be generally assumed.
He showed that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a 9% overall contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use, with energy efficiency increased by twenty percent over the past five years, and another goal is to be achieved by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party chairman had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right was to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, reassured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right had bestowed upon him.
In an interview held prior to the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case via the appeal procedure so that a decision is made by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he said it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional emerged stronger from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the local elections, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so “internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional would need for the next three years, so it would hand over the staffs "to those that the Council would determine."
"I'm very unconcerned and open about this, and I'd be proud to give each of the five the position of party chairman."
He predicted that the party's upswing recorded in the last elections on July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, bear the flag and are observed across the country, so "a lot of hopes and longings are put into them and I am sure Gabino is on the level of requirements."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his disc course as part of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI’s supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he said.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like the ones he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama campaigns for law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call on your senators and urge them to pass it,” the president tweeted.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that asks the public to contact their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice waiting for us, the time has come to listen to you,” he stresses.
The news was circulated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except for the expansion of tax cuts from Bush’s time and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule for the other projects can be drawn up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would "apply for the vote to close the debate" so that the Dream Act - law that could allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in that country for the last five years and are enrolled at a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the passing of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet set his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Desire to Language' was a walk in which the participants took a strong stand for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event was the Round Table dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble", the Argentinean writings sweetly spat at the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz then described as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist, who is looking to learn what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but hints for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who robbed her of her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs and concludes that she "only learned of the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented an adorable narrative, which he called "Praise of Invention," in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
In allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turning point and told of America, the great novel that was not lacking in its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo, who criticized the stories of the
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), ridiculed the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even the feeling of shame was lost."
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and there reality and lie approach each other where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the "tradition of Cervantes."
"We inherited from him to be what is being told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of the social violence that invades her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and readers as if it were a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also "heavened this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, the intellectual habits and control of consciousness also run out of dogmatisms, forgetting that "behind every affirmation is a little no and behind every denial is a little yes."
In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to rediscover the world in black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he played crucial games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match, two different styles are also faced by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had crucial games three times, and so far he has kept up well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has advanced with the medal to the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played successive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put in a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to put in his title, but ultimately missed a player's eleven.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be pursued again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I'm giving myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," he said.
"The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two penalties, and I believe that this is not a lesson until the game is finished.
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, does not disturb him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate has prepared us for a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervosity, this time, we will be able to hold the final game.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer be just the second champion and for the first time to taste the fame that the titles bring.
The U.S. amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves to the consulate for visa application before their conversation with the service agencies; costs will be shortened in this way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and in the Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application service bodies (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their conversation in the consulate.
The ASC staff shall record the applicant’s biometric data, which shall be reviewed by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter value to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors.
Those who just want to renew their visa do not need to have a conversation in the consulate, they only need to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference tomorrow to present a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference at NASA’s Washington headquarters tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
On convening the press conference, NASA reassured that it would present “a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life,” triggering speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in hostile environments that were previously thought to be uninhabitable. It was hypothesized that if their living conditions improved, they could turn into intelligent beings like humans.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment considered too toxic to all imaginable life forms, as the lake is heavily arsenic.
In some way, the microbial uses arsenic as a survival resource, and taking this ability into account, the chances are that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different life form, a second life form that is different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) on whether its chemical composition is similar to Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent, had already been installed. The four questioned the introduction of the "two-party system" into the chamber.
Before the introductory session began in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a "two-party system" would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the bureau headed by panist Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginal position with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, based on their political will and if they did not, they would be subjugated again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this point I (the opposition coalition) come, that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which don't even take into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia stated that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that after being monopolistic, Congress should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the start, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more," said Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, in allusion to PAN and PRI, stated that Congress has currently turned into a 'prey' for two.
"It was only one party before, now they divide it into two."
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo asked to respect the deputies and to give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five, which are currently seen as split into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because it is because of reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check of just over 200,000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last November 16th with the purpose of "invoicing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount owed to it and, as a result, the number of cheques still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debt is paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal as required by law if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be re-used.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010 during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, had paid the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
Businesses also took place with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist sites need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the burglary of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourism industry applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the dealer association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions, it was demanded to care for the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had a negative effect, as tourists would come to stroll and see the clutter, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don't worry about how much money you're losing, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work slowly and planlessly that way."
The hotel owner José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the tourist’s fall had alerted to the city’s lack of prevention and lack of maintenance work.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid such a thing happening again. How to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, also we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration has to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It needs to be a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Promoci<0xC3><0xB3>n Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s tourist sites, because they would not be used properly and would create a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore along with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural sites that would have to be cleaned and cleaned in order to make them attractive for tourism and supply them to the inventory we are promoting for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s corporate sector calls for a worthy parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes up a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and to not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurial Coordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs really exercise their right to act free of any agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning them into carnival comparators of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions."
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in any way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to allocate the necessary importance to the state budget to support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second-least means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is Seeking
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are eagerly desired by the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on the next day of the Trinity, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so desire.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes hard times are hot because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go to the street with the goors for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive,'" Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Elf-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe is 12; ten-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as is 10; eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out as part of the breakdown of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have served mainly in drug making.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of which were from Sherbrooke.
The detainees are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke Judicial Building hours after their arrest.
They could be accused of, among other things, the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information obtained from the public has allowed us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel clarified.
Around 70 policemen from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be easily tracked
The bill of the Conservatives, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is likely to be tampered with after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I'm holding a party that has put fetters on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person identified as a seagoing ship for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian law and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill as it turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will wait and see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demanded that their party did not behave steadfastly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce by mediating another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes affecting Canada and treating the country like a pedestrian."
"They expect Canada to take tough measures," said Kenney's response.
“The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A Conservative, however, has told QMI that the government would convene a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit conjured out of the hat" and "a solution prepared at the end of a table".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to form a committee of inquiry is to resign from Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
To get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the auditing authority so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He is also of the opinion that the Quebec could grant the same powers as Commissioners to audits, which would also allow her to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have poured on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The river flows in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, become an object of flood monitoring and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, the heavy rainfall has caused the passage of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn down due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, said Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Flood Center, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday about the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) due to his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians as well as his failed speech about radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements "have contained inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such a rude speech that is not appropriate for broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which involves the spread of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts in the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was made as a result of a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the questionable consequences of the Dupont le midi broadcast would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had come up with a media-effective dispute in this regard, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favor of Haiti aid, since one would not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already paid off my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unflattering form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted “beyond its obligations”.
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing and in Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges on the tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
“I started fighting sports like kung-fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago,” said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop among the pros.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the man working as a security officer and employed by UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
“I have won in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
“I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China.”
"It was those fighters from each category who were among the first four in the last World Cup."
"I babe got bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I got behind in Vietnam in 2005."
"I finished the tournament in fifth place in China in 2007, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, in which fist strikes and footsteps are allowed as well as ground throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence in the King of Sanda, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China," said the sympathetic pound guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a companion to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important, $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" got the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that evokes the risk of distortion of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a game that's off-limits the competition."
“This means that instead of playing games in a secret way, you are now performing in open form,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said in a statement yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract would have been a discarded game.
“I remain true to my line,” she watered, reinforcing that the PQ had gone “unreasonable” and that it “lacked her hardness.”
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its working size.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be completed by 2012.
Nonetheless, the contract was awarded without a competition being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overfly of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozen, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the fact that the contract for the project management has been approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will rise."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and you tell them you're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte reiterated.
This contract granted to the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After reviewing, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and advisory contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had said that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that “financed” it before clarifying that it was their leaders.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but unequivocally skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but no confidence in the labelled brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
It is a pity, even though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it swarms with information in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is identified as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admits that they do not believe in the company’s environmental commitment as much as they believe in green corporate advertising, according to the measurement tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s responsible consumer center.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Nevertheless, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently nurtured by nearly one third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another announcement, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprints left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the carpooling centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and the company Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The development company Angus and the company Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, which had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have requested.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could create a viable solution on favorable conditions, at least according to sources extracted from the state-run rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the petition has since been summarily corrected downwards.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
A few days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counterproposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le and Angus now have until December 31st to respond.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec-owned community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he had not also given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, complained of substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the State Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients on the line.
Société Angus and the company Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le with Christian Yaccarini at the head, in turn, are heading a privately funded campaign, of which they hope to raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le.
The aim of the future purchasers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not dismiss the newspaper Le Devoir and ignored what he and his group thought of the downwardly corrected proposals they had made.
Secret of Complexly Shaken Canada Unveiled
The new U.S. diplomat leadership, spread through WikiLeaks, uncovers the secret of what the United Nations considers to be Canadians under the Canadians’ inferiority complex, but they reveal the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada with the same blow.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election process, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantive content you have to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports from which point the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian-inherent inferiority complex may cause Canadian, political leaders to much more likely talk about everyday internal disputes than to push the United States in this election to black Peter (as in 1988 in the Free Trade Campaign)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it."
The ambassador understands this "ear-deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot process."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the communication sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa business executive, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s continued confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has arisen as a result of an invigoration program of between $30 and $40 billion,” Breese said.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties in this way would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another communication dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative picture that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading by the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or kidnappings can be observed for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA through muscle prostheses.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file again".
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had spoken here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCC) equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs emitted to the earth due to lighting, if the white-hot bulbs, which still represent a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans designed to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt would still have to be deducted from this balance to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-hot bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice as much.
The compact phosphor bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as the ones that the manufacturer Philips launched this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, suggesting the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely novel light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact phosphor bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact phosphor bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after the expiry of the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a U.N. chief of press.
"He asks all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had let the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have been heard that the CEI may finally pronounce the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara who is leaving office.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of "fraudulent" voting charges in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-Rebel Forces Nouvelles (FN) camp during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo’s actions are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North, who disavows any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in promulgating the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he has lost; and submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations had warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that it could be held responsible in the event of any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of elections on October 31 with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% with the participation of overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
Looking more closely, 3.4 million people in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points seen within three months, +0.5 percentage points seen over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the people over 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) versus 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne (PS) region, was investigated and sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of social assets, misappropriation of general property, cowardice, corruption, illicit bribery and arms ownership, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading brains."
“It’s easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made a point of justifying the judge by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but to keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
He would never have known about the area of business competence or the destination of the related funds, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then set free under the condition of keeping away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other people had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to deputy prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal company, is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "evasion and misappropriation of general property by a public service official", the other on the basis of "compliance with misappropriation of public funds".
Jeannie Peretti, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, was also charged with “healing and embezzlement of social assets”.
Among the people facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained for a similar affair of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company has helped to wash money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the field of waste disposal, was carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the procurement and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affair Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage" held the French public in breath, put diplomacy on alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not involve the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American judiciary for trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss into a flashlight.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on the way to dealing with hostages".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy, spoke with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything they could to bring back their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without interruption" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do this."
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in avoidance maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "hostage for the purpose of political extortion."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to come about on August 16, the day she flees to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée is anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that “will exacerbate itself.”
“In the near future, the Iranians could arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On the occasion of a re-discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier reassures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant picks a phone number, re-issues it, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings in Paris headed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe through proclamations and media-organized "flight attempts", Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influenced media role".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 summoned "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that caused the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "are aimed at reaffirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "perceived by numerous critic voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Syria seeks to bring to light what accolades can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to “seed discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them for everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our country's mistress".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Cinderella,” which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials pointed out.
A bill to ask online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of cult and family ministries described.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency Agence France Presse's ministerial commissioner responsible for this bill.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also contemplates asking manufacturers to cut down the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint the organizers of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the swindling for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) specifies the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC had re-introduced it on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that fired on three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had primarily engaged in intense lobbying with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a re-issue of the move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort suffice to enhance the image of England in front of the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repression against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadions, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the undisclosed hint of the accusations made by the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You're throwing them with dirt, you're trying to compromise them," Putin wettered.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, the headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s much-awaited 2026 World Cup grant for China, which will make Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar pulling all the registers with the upkeep of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time shift) acquitted by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the openness
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made him think he was stumped.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be Ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidency function is not good.
So you have to act as if the doubt existed from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas assured Sarkozy in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians he would let the perspective of "two mandates" sound, had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You have at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they make comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS are admonishing to fight earlier than assumed.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," he said.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled with the publicity.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to a close at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly cannot afford to distort even the current, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, in order not to cause their exacerbation.
The political costs are far too high.
France’s Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it thinks the central bank can do even more, for example by boosting its program of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not shown himself very talkative about his plans, but rather satisfied to point out that the program of buying government papers on the secondary market would "continue to operate" and that we will "see how the decisions are going to be made at the meeting on Thursday".
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled the ECB’s bond purchases last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, she made new purchases yesterday on Irish and Portuguese government papers.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of €67 billion since May 2010.
Among merchants, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is in no way questioned (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a significant change in prices.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to make ample use of the unrestricted reserves of funds, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already confident that this measure will be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine the ECB changing its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank, suspects.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, the ECB “should maintain such a purchase volume of bonds that will revive the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone’s sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It has to come at all costs to the players of the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states,” a key bond holder testified yesterday.
Because if the interest rates started to fly high, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday with the drop in corner rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the region's president, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and expected to hear an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "seriously concerned" about the "market turbulence" and a potential risk of contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In clear terms, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dizzying tax revenues that put the state at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecast was a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate budget is expected to reach 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against the forecast by governments 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of Italy’s economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time,” Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF, said in a statement.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term, as, despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.), less stabilization progress is required from Italy than from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no-confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could already be organized at the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period for decision-making regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoons and in the evenings: Europeans are clearly together, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency territory.”
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the feet of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot yet be mentioned.
Rating agency Standard & Poor’s had announced that it could reduce Portugal’s debt record, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly affecting the banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas said in a statement.
Especially since “political time goes much slower than that of the markets”.
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying discussions to reinforce the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The EU Stability Fund’s first re-issues of paper are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the agency entrusted Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilized through the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are, in turn, seeking to implement structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to austerity measures, but are expected to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other, at all costs, is to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have established their own budget corrections and decided on indispensable structural reforms that will bring them back their trust in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-engage in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, which is at the forefront of the European public debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of doped financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are on the rise.
Snow and Smooth Ice: 24 departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic problems, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alarm stage due to the imminent risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already in Orange alert level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangent the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, in some cases also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is significant enough to cause traffic congestion and impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads of over 7.5 tonnes are closed for heavy transport, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who refused to use their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses was cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights departing from Paris’ Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining for billions.
At least in the discussions.
It is worth mentioning in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which will be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend in the markets a portion of the financial sum to its double.
Today, the first calculations have finally been made.
The supplementary budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, goes "in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quoted in the text.
Of the 4 billion, it is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation raised by the state and gradually made available to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e., you can cover the project planning for three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually subtracted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four billion promised will be sought for a long time, is in danger of causing a fairly moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and embittered spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirming the fact that each file created by an intelligence service (an x-any nation) is made up exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read in any X-journal for months anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's terrifyingly caricatured profile has been providing cabaret artists with fabric for their sketch for a long time.
The rule that the secret dossiers can only consist of known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism do not believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
As well as the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, an editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such an uproar made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into espionage centers, with the exception of a few small representation tasks.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an X-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries the significant blow against the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal puts less the victims, rather the "sharp judges" in trouble.
But let us dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction you make, the hotel you visit, the highway you choose, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you consider what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control gait ceases to be unilaterally directed and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing any secrets of Hillary Clinton's power to be empty secrets.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this resentment that has been inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future – that would be equivalent to a signage glued to the street corner.
But it’s just as obvious that with current technologies, it’s in vain to hope that confidential reports can be kept secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds science-fiction and romantic at the moment, but I see myself compelled to introduce myself to the government agents, secretly moving emphatically on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in mere memory, and moreover hiding the few written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film band by band by spinning from the back to the front and uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing more than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane, including transfers.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France makes its financial promises beautiful
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the fast-start (also known as early-start) financing promises implemented by developing countries.
And already the coarse French fairies have been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report from their Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to respect its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that additional use has been made without being detrimental to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the indicative value that they consider best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen as a benchmark for those of 2009: international financing will be maintained, and will add 150 million to the Fast-Start funding over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of “all new projects” of 2010 was “new and additional”.
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of French aid to developing countries may remain stable (or may decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, include 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often emission mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is received as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan should be counted as a commitment for the lender country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses large amounts of loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% committed to donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfill its obligations, France only spends 10 cents and understands a comparable commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: in part with a further development of the action over time and in the other part with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why the other member states continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let themselves be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't the case.
In any case, it is indispensable to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and of balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, decisive and currently debated topic): one does not escape the question of "accountability" or the accounting method of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive in matters of dispute as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “accountability” as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemical substances over the course of the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent an illustrative character of the problem addressed", had bought the foodstuffs usually consumed by a 10-year-old child at meals between July and September, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit portions, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – have been studied, as have laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinin disruption factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the approximate totality of cases, this survey shows very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinin disruption is alarming," notes the association.
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were also spiked.
In tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "richest", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "poison cocktail" for the consumer "will likely be undervalued," the study said.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV), in turn, has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified references to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
