28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim’s brother said that he can’t imagine anyone who would want to harm him, “At last he went uphill again.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco judicial department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things were finally going uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, to prepare us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of argument.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
“With everything going wrong in the world, he was that uncut diamond that glowed brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s note phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and the reality."
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, these things are rather scary for me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about being considered "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current Cosmopolitan.
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of TV with a loose shower and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
“We don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” she said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be released on August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their work night, they hunted home in a quick gallop to the feed troughs.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And with that, the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany’s best golfer of all time – 101 tournament victories – was again close to horses.
He was guided with his family over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swing himself for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has already made it.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bobsled driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and the posthumous Erhard Handballer.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society migrated to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
It would be very different, Trump said.
He will massively reduce regulations, and he stands up for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and needs money to do so.
That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they have to invest in it almost in the same way.
The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the state-critical Republican Tea Party wing.
So Trump could still have in-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energy through her investment program, calling for “a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in terms of infrastructure - also in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, the two do not want to isolate the US from international trade – they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They should also be better paid for, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics accuse him of making the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost everyday for women who flee on their own.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby that is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in his arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes she is being watched.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and is working on the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
“Men are fleeing for wars because they are being persecuted politically, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as carriers of hope,” she says.
For women, other reasons predominate for the escape: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
On the run, that goes on.
“The fact that smugglers demand sexual action for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon,” says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mistaken, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and at worst abused.
This results in about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich being traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly did not arise voluntarily."
Many women are so used to it that they say nothing.
"Or they dare not speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great".
Since they often don’t know how to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some responded with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Refugees are also not accommodated separately in Swabia, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, some communal accommodations have floors or their own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it states: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be - continuing - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, according to the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be seen in the crowd that exists on the house in Munich.
“Since talking about the existence of us, we have a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new labour-fighting measures
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire council to approve more labour-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to address ministers’ concerns about the treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” to problems, resulting in the treaty being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour-fighting measures that begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failures in NHS history.
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed slender and he barely exuded warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “love friend” Putin – according to one report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was raging.
Putin said, accusing Ankara of falling in the back of Russia.
The offense was even greater as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could have achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is furious with the West because it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment over the snail pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d’état.
For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glittering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent, as an analyst once described me, an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel displaced by the West and ill-treated and now align themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they hadn’t even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to talk to each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori wins 3,000th at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000ths of profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the cheer as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern era and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has inspired fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been a winner in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vivid personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had trouble returning from his six-month ban, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from over - Dettori once said that he wants to continue at competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was for many years part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin said he had ordered, without giving reasons, “the release of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin’s website says (in Russian) that he was later the protocol head and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking of his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the government is to support your activity as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
At the moment, no one knows.
But the official claim – that a man who was once acclaimed as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once – met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it’s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post — one could almost say — for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.
Once, it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to the presidency three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised publicly on Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysteries about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaals that were spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, released a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers", which are approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slanted ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, finishing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is in place, and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering civil engineering and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
Heikel, because the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be still alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat continued to move on its own.
“We saw the boat spinning around her and imagined the worst,” said the head of Moelfre Vince Jones’ rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it go to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: “The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but it was released from the person who was driving the boat when the boat was patrolled.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously Injured - Man Punishes His Ex-Friend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
According to police yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut off his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When he came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
She couldn’t get him out of the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the man's ex-partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken on a much stronger duty in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting a "acting concept of housing".
Disputes are programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should build the cheap apartments?
So far, there is no regulation.
Christoph Bratmann, chairman of the SPD Group, said: "We agree with the Greens that if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also arise in stock.
However, the main point of dispute in the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing on such areas."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, will provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The left wants tough conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is intensifying.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the building administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how to compensate for the loss of another 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expired ties should now be purchased by the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price tie.
This is possible in the West City.
In one fell swoop, the problem could be solved.
In the western part of the city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price tie for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically again, one distances one from the goal of the so-called mixing.
A concentration of socially weak people in only a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to go on board."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
However, this does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teens and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs emerged).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest decreased slightly before the game was released in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries has been postponed due to the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on their phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the “average” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of tracked people exercising 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes," "get off the sofa," and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's the matter?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the bar.
Breathtaking on the floor.
Brilliant all along.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympics.
Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the hover during the women's single multi-fight final in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall as she consolidates her reputation of being the best of her generation, or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that didn’t go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the Spring, Texas family with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-fight finals in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a proclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long journey to the top, never planned the future, that’s not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-competition competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceiving.
Floating beams and ground gymnasts - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were lurking.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman gently embraced her as they expected her finale—a pure formality—and tears flowed on Bile’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims killed in serial killer case while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard's police spokesman said the shooting had led investigators to get a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two more injured in nine attacks within four months, predominantly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to be the serial killer’s work.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can’t do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't agree with that.
What's not true at all -- of course they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know people were still doing that,'" Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was 3 years old, and he still can’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk with assistance and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented for "Please sing me something before."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says, Edmund invented some characters on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores, threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the Tangipahoa community alone would have requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only slowly flow across the stepped rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The River Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another step-son who lives nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the nearest fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread "fast" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly full since Wednesday due to the rains.
Authorities stated that heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subordinate in Tangipahoa reported 200 homes flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed away by the flood.
Emergency shelters were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the city’s administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but no were reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the lumbar, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles oversaw the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were sleeves.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police skin man Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm as she played outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds out everyone proud.
This team is finally reflecting the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual women's multi-battle event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that’s not what gym classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have more affordable and accessible gymnastics.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to the youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, capturing so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to begin their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a “no-man’s land” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said: "Assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by means of talks met with the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.
That was the promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the suspension and address the concerns of assistant doctors".
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further labour-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April envisaged a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director-general of the NHS staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work combat measures do not achieve anything of the very few, but already burden overloaded teams and service providers and only cause the patients, caregivers and their families to worry, distress and interrupt."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training kits, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave, and gender pay gaps in medicine – was a sign of how serious it was for employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to be in compliance with the agreements with the February B.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form coverings.
When the topping breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE’s draft guidance, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said, "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one-quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Makes Electoral Fraud Bloom in Muslim Areas
Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread election fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
“This not only serves to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way, and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.
“Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him.”
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He spoke particularly alarmingly about the fraudulent postal election - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including running IDs to prove identity
“As evidence, pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from editing postal election documents to stop "worn ones."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider asking voters for your ID before you vote.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they’ve cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Perform systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic mail election.
Prohibition of political activists handling full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations.
A law amendment that facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photographer ban in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (except for Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electoral booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal complaint was filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check-off" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
As the mother of parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of certain authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's biker doppelganger and other famous doppelgangers from Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have fallen out of line this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doppelgänger - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s doppelganger on the racetrack, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A- celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures of him looking eeriely similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see a great similarity myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good looking guy, so I'm going to take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more focused this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another ongoing comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user stated her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist at Turnen Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for Olympic Games apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer has died "like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staff outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to add more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like a miff, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squadron 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China has died “like a pig”???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many called him to account.
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the remark via Twitter.
Scott Russel apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on TV and to our followers on social media last night.
To be clear, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance and not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympic broadcast," he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged over woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she sampled what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she put on again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as she took off the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressing up again and going out.
"She didn't seem to bother anyone watching her - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think someone would take home underpants that another person was wearing and that were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I have learned, employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing her and taking off again and she wasn't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 at our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapon Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.
When approaching you from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker crumples with pain, hit him with the run in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends to be.
But remember that in the event of a robbery, it is most secure to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a travel guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and gag reflex - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and disgusting places.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his trains on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the rinse button of a pull-up toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repugnant, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling around the world eating peculiar and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
As a child, I was relatively worried about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.
In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample smear showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after her luminometer number exceeded 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in various places such as the bathroom.
In the movie, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equip Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say it like this – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I'm glad we've included some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed in particular associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they used at least occasionally products that included lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Delogation of Social Housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a delogation with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing cooperative employees found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family has been relocated and is believed to now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don’t think people have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said that the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, quarrels, and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order in June for anti-social behavior.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
There were cracks in the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delocated her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "You weren't worried about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the town hall
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as deloging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors to watch.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogation
Homeowner workers will now have to remove garbagebergs that surround the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug on commercial intent.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone was her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without a home, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will defraud tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-denial, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet crosses the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft made an incredible crash flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes across a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within reach over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to nearby area fires, but the air forces insisted that security was never at risk.
Fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Super Cup away against FC Seville, the rematch rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner has to do without Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, among other things, in terms of strength with the defeating cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
In addition, goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament sprain in the knee during the training, which at least for the time being clarified the one-on-one question at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and Ter Stegen have been competing for the number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique renounced a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions the lead.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated by 0-4 on Saturday in a Liverpool test game.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince at the 3:2 in the test galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after being extended in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and is aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4–0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
With this, the world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final as expected and made up the title among themselves.
It was thus clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and left their protégés alone in fair competition.
“I’ve played the matches so far for my country.”
“I play for myself in the final,” Zhang had consistently said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really struggled with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace at the record and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-fourths in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits "major problems" in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-track and self-confident multi-millionaire voiced something like concern, correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida, or Virginia.
Guilt was false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds shaking
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same level.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I’ve done so far.”
This will either be successful, or I will make a very very nice, long holiday.
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is okay, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to scrap funds in support of his election campaign if he cannot present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress want to be more involved.
Olympics: Third Fraud in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are in danger after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the team management of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The World Association IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed," Kenya's chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi said in a statement.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of training controls.
Ferguson Rotich was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target controls before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out earlier that particular athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the Summer Games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympic Games.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fights are compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a big runner nation.
The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a number of ARD television reports, accusations have repeatedly been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently demanded a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been doped extensively and systematically.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year of Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
And then there’s Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria.
In the orchestra trench, the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he boasts.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful blend, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony with sadness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl Joining ISIS Was Killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to keep people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for Supreme Court in case of election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s endorsement since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland “with a certain degree of certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he hadn’t spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause restlessness with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, being laypersons and helpers to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because "playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nudity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation for Dialogue and the World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", the association's chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Due to the harsh actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, chairman of the association.
Because the government has already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are fleeing within Turkey.
After the failed coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
In Germany, too, a “witch hunt” against Erdogan critics is taking place.
I don’t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, also the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation for Dialogue and Education, of the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany who were recognized for political persecution before the coup.
As of the 30th of June, this number was 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
In 2021, the state elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's stupider than it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites itself.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting votes are hard to find.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how much newcomer AfD is cutting off and what remains in the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is running an almost inconspicuous campaign, one sees away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary prolific predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s blossoming.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to run an election campaign at the wrong place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel’s Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, secretary-general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it is not a shame for anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeastern CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are breaking down the base in the country, that you have to make a lot of effort to find a link to the people again.
They are like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: scarcely present in the vastness of the country.
However, the council of the CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-explanatory: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the social democrats were last, with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They make the holiday emergency a modern virtue and put their election campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online electoral campaign", the country's president Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curving through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also likes it.
Your impression: "Election leave in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blockade
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished.
There is everywhere praise for those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends around 8 p.m.
"They've done it all pretty jittery," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet fuel station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be moved to the south as planned at half-time, until the end of October everything is expected to be ready.
It is also commended that the people responsible for the construction work are welcome, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy chief executive officer responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain struggled with more traffic noise, because many were looking for sneaky paths and were more familiar with their navigation than with the signs.
As a result, some trucks were smashed into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not complied with, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant excesses," says King, who once informed himself about the situation on site.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it had become calmer.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue slumps in them lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that of course "the customer base is missing".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The decline in sales is “well over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has “returned its operation by two years.”
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, at the request of Göhner, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.
Göhner knows about other counties, where such things were handled more generously.
In all the complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to its long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now pass by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice elsewhere too.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the completion of the refurbishment work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being screwed up.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerant status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the conciliator.
All of his proposals are “politically reasonable” for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, further issues would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is interested in results and in an “achievable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had some time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
A lot is already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is launching a second start for proposals that were not yet to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and jihadists with double citizenship unbutton the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chance at all with the coalition partner.
A few new ideas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re presents as well.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought specifically into the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than hitherto - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things still seem unexplained and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of the patient, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins from Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people could not be excluded even in election campaign times.
Internal security has come to the fore immensely.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly addressing the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, there has been a lot of tension between the two parties.
First there was a frenzied dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn’t think of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Re-opening them doesn’t make sense.
And in a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a dispute.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the party, said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to increase security.”
Volkswagen is still coming through with a glimpse.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries worldwide are rising.
However, it is not going around in all markets.
In the recall process, there are swirls around a term.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year with a modest start.
Europe’s largest automaker can continue to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
With 449100 cars, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries declined by almost a sixth.
Head of brand sales Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a restraint in purchases in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been strained, a spokeswoman explained.
In the US, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a downside.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony is already further glimpsed by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler continued to show sales growth from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, with 5,904 million vehicles worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issues a "guarantee-equal" certificate to the customer after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now gives its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Department of Transportation confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA."
“Deviations from this will not be accepted,” said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has taken on the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to type-approval will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself, however, does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, half a year after the conversion, come into a workshop with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interest of the customer to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal causing uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding criminal interest rates from rich savers in the future – as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: normal savers "should not be afraid to pay for their savings interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Starting in September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand a refund from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on current or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year,” Paul said.
For some time now, he has been guarding 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
“They’re in my central bank account and they’re causing 0.4 percent of the costs,” said the head of the bank.
"I can't put down 4,000 euros for every million."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't like the fifth one!" said the bank's chief executive.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few went to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association said: “The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs for all banks.”
It is not possible to carry them on their own in the long term.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thuringian People’s Bank and Raiffeisen Bank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, but the competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong".
A banker said there was "a clientele that is a little more luxuriant from wealth".
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if they keep money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
“There are currently no other banks known to the Bavarian Cooperative Association that charge a reimbursement for private deposits,” Ernst said.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), said: "The threshold to go negative with regard to the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to see it under the pseudonym Not AllSeparateMenMiddle-aged with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are probably between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk amidst a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stalking wildly before I stop, holding my hands and saying something defining like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I guess,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hippe, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves getting to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I’ve had, people have usually emptied themselves of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom in supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took an impetus to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record envelopes, of items that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with a lot of people.
It’s an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" an employee flutters from a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don’t have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, who dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around the age of 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roaring from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more of a shopper than a big buyer.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is...” she drifts off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be patterning the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them—perhaps because they’re just purely decorative, some so high that it’s impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Although my research has shown that YouGov’s results are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street’s record stores and browsing through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a sinister, 30-year-old false presenter who protrudes over the shoulders of unaware middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says the record was in a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer for demolition of stores in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by Calais authorities to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to demolish 72 provisional stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of Calais Prefecture "are absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tearing down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to let himself be undermined.
“I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons would have led to the debacle.
At the World Time Trial Championship in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed recently.”
"That also counts my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on the 54.5 km on Wednesday against Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympics: Tennis professional Siegemund misses semi-final
The victory move of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world ranking 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Mouth of victory, which was plagued by back problems, was only able to make its impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis professional to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend – Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology company buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam was launched in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players, confront enemies, and provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to a global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
For customers, nothing should change as a result of the takeover.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google's mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s razors have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transmit speed-savers particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Vitronic Enforcement Trailers from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, in areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway construction sites or bridges to be rehabilitated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained there with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the raised state, you can move the trailer with any car with a trailer coupling, according to the manufacturer.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered during measurement operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, also fireproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
UK wins silver in 7-yard rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance at 7-yard rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, trailing, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path ahead.
Eight years ago, they lost to Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and made GB's attacks bounce off fun.
The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner, and it felt like they were walking in buses.
With four minutes remaining, Jerry Tuwai added another right-hand attack, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rematch and there was still over a minute of playtime ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through other weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at halftime and closed the fijianic gap...for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interlude of fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long gone in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-tip with another try in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked crushingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forwards in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row by fighting with the coach's cancer
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hieves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed for the second Olympic gold in a row in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of the British sport, who set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th undefeated bet, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in the helm is a battalion of willing helpers that contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and it was nobody more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start his treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if in such circumstances that is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary provided for clarity
Ruppert Göller, the managing director of the Veitenstein Group, is retired.
The association is considered "Bayern-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia recognized the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "by Bavaria as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water manager in 1985 and was appointed as managing director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they have ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
As outstanding events it mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high-rise tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipes.
There was no stoppage and innovations were repeatedly taken up, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked hard for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He received a lot of praise and recognition for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman and he was a loyal handsome man.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the pipe break at the high tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was once only maintained because the high tank was filled with hoses from Pettstadt.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with her son Tiago's autism - and addresses other affected parents: "You have to have the courage to talk about it."
“Medicine has made great progress,” the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
However, the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at the Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relational status in Bargteheide - man shoots on life partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner around 10:45 a.m. on Friday in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after which he is publicly investigated.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a baldness.
Meanwhile, police have released a photo of him.
It's a few years old, though.
Meanwhile, the man wears a bald.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry the gun with him, the police said.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police speak of a "relationship state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
“We’re not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-laden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the amount of millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green electricity are off the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge at the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to check-in.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will there be an EEG surcharge of 20 percent.
However, this is not the case in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-power generation.
This largely sets the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
“With our ‘steel is the future’ campaign in mind, this is a first step.”
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate as the world’s largest producer country China massively threw steel on the world market in view of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry premier Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as announced by the Stahl Economic Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year’s level by two percent.
Thanks to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in output in the coming months.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching degree she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.
In doing so, she does something good to her health and to her spirit.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together regularly, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.
Seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs don’t get out of the puss even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Seniors Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia-sick people remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone, practice so that they don’t just focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing yourself: If I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating – that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can detect the degree of arousal of cat babies on the miauen of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens that are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University of Applied Sciences and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miauwing of less and heavily aroused juveniles are either intangible or irrelevant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten scream differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more aroused kittens, which were raised additionally.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
“All the females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the screams,” Konerding said.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this call of the very excited kitten played.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans several times.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the match between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is required.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted overthrow in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be impaired.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one blames for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping before football.
The prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group now living in the United States.
Sükür is said to be a follower of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact, this has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy guards” in public places across the country, Erdogan declared on Wednesday to be over.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Besiktas workers’ club traditionally do not belong to the president’s friends.
What the majority of Turks are united in the face of dramatic experiences in history, however, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the cup winner "Gala" it will especially again come to Lukas Podolski.
With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" applauded him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season came to a conciliatory conclusion for the record champion.
After the preliminary round-K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired in the Europa League early.
In the Süper Lig it only reached sixth place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
“We did that, and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 season hits as the Süper-Lig goaltender king laid the basis for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old’s return.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and only loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman quoted.
However, the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Opportunities at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it – they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had claimed her start right just before the games after a doping ban, was ruthlessly whistled out and bowed out at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scene: with an attached smile, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it became clear that she was not going to get gold, the audience burst into a rush of cheers.
But there are still many other athletes who are starting at the Olympic Games in Rio despite the doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in 9.80 seconds over 100 m and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown to be taking the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 were tested positive for the banned stimulant drug methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the intentional intake and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go into the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
One means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give Olympic silver in 2004 due to steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a ruling of the International Sports Court CAS.
With 80.04 m, it is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a banned dietary supplement, the ban on the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned her return home for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a night out area on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up, killing another person, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the early morning.
During the detonation near the popular Patong beach, a taxi driver was injured, according to police.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police area.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin.
“The bombings carry the same handwriting,” Army General Danai Kritmethavee told journalists on Friday.
“We expect it to be a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or to international terrorism.
“This is just local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence alerts in recent days about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always small bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not recommended to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years as well.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military una, which took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits itself, having led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get to grips with the rebellion of Muslim rebels that has been simmering in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the Confederation also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications for efforts against the free democratic fundamental order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, the head of the German Constitutional Protection Agency, of the German press agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitarians".
Maaßen said his authority had agreed closely with the state offices in the decision.
“Groups like the ‘Identitarian Movement’ are trying to pick up their target group where it stands,” the head of the state said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a publicity for one’s own cause.
Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming that plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
“Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who have elected, for example, the CDU, the SPD, or the left, but who have then radicalized through right-wing extremist sentiment.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habe becomes the internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habe at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In the social networks, Habe subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and took 59th place from 59 starters.
However, it was rather his not-so-sporty figure that caught the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a special starting right by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habe is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the “Robel of the Whale.”
Based on a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani’s run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters freestyle.
Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition.
A seat in the front row to the stunning architecture of the Los Angeles Central Library
Learn about the history of the central library in downtown, as the Society of Architectural Historians/Southern California Chapter hosts a salon with Arnold Schwartzman and Stephen Gee, the authors of the new book "Los Angeles Central Library: A History of its Art and Architecture".
It is planned that Gee and Schwartmann will discuss and share images of the 1926 Bertram Goodhue design as well as the 1993 Restoration and addition of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.

An open industrial loft in DTLA gets a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th anniversary of the central library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin had left her business on Monday around 5.30 p.m., forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the imminent election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he wouldn’t care: “Ultimately, it will either work out, or I’ll have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a phone interview with U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle appears to be high.
Post plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
The company will soon start trading with the transporter.
From next year, the Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market.
"We want to enter into the sale to third parties," a post-speaker said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies.
Post-CEO Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and was aiming for a long-term complete changeover to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s streets since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann would become all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised would be absent.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five of the industry faces a new start in staffing.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management board took over Gerhard Hausruckinger, the former member of the board of directors, as of September 1st, the company announced.
He is to officially take over the function of a "speaker of the board" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to mention details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that the shareholders were the last to be disappointed by the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-Spitze since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent bad GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the quandts would do the same," he said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With respect to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter have mainly weighed on the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of 139 million euros required in the Consumer Experience business unit led to a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK still generated consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident in a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evade, according to her information, an accommodating truck, which partly drove on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the street to the right and slipped into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency medical car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travellers were taken back by a bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl sewage plant area from 1 October 2016 instead of 2.10 euros so far; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
According to an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that undercovers for these sewage plants were accumulated.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal bases, to operate the plants cost-effectively.
As of October 1, 2016, citizens, as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the wallet.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-covers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater supply, which ranged between 6800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants declined slightly.
Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three plants had incurred considerable refurbishment and repair costs, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage at the Azendorf sewage plant.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged out, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low wastewater in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance "strike through".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared the last 20 years from large maintenance costs for the sewage plants.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater purpose association could not be expanded by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria registers inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% as measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month of the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
As in the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education remained unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is already bordering on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past, accusing them of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when it suggested to some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, wrong teeth, and dazzled cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely circulated over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensibility.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “so it’s much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account prompting others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in Snapchat hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren't in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on under-represented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will have her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I'm wondering if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not OK."
Military leadership fakes ISIS intelligence, Congressional Committee notes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee reported in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on American efforts to fight the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership flaws in Centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that Obama’s government leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State’s threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it meets the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican Congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the Republican Task Force’s conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging morale among analysts and "given excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with the Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published by The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were taken after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the Inspector General’s investigation is still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the defense ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has had repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).
Last year’s allegations, however, raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresees only a small occupying force in Iraq and little time spent thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government officials, the team around Mr. Hooker noted that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth women's field hockey match, a showdown with Britain ahead
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a Thursday match against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever having done that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I am not one of those people who remembers their doors.
However, she knows that: the American women are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the same level in their group with the British in first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will avoid the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising swirl through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three had a hockey stick in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to turn for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn’t have the workload in London that we now have.
We were able to pull the rudder all the way around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the torrents in the first half of the game with a backhand blow from the close area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed themselves surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and dipped the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games so far.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
Amidst the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a frenzied relay race between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from crossbow to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a women’s swarm of dimples, could well have been among those well-known names broadcast at Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV ads if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fenger.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely over the last 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outer arm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than that for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "jumping board."
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (turns, pikes, and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopers have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground in their quest for gold.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but in the television broadcast also another ridiculous goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring even when watching these games.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaulting in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as competition at the Olympics can only be.
Women's qualifying and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; men's finals on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the targeting and objectification of male athletes – as the male US runners recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley expects his air-worshipping, new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia met with violent government resistance.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in gunfire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was merciless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led government repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or jail, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this timid, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones became more common and internet services improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that too is changing right now.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which make up around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representatives to handle opponents and render them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently messed up by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge hike."
Donald Trump declares Obama’s claim that he founded ISIS was “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump backed on Thursday’s allegation, insisting in interviews that he really didn’t intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was totally serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is coming down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling poll scores.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared, “Of course I meant it sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the reaction is going out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than defuse the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more edifying tone as his poll scores have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But as he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal associates in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he says is legitimate political comments,” Mr. Giuliani said, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He ridiculed the “poor, miserable” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t do it!”
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once displaced by the price of the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay for cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
Soap Cherie, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted, and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, then it is also a reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything-ball with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business had taken over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we’re going to go into their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and a prune pudding as a dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman, in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells about living in a home on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be released Tuesday at Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity as they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the shrapnel country.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense issue for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: mysterious foods such as breads and cashew rolls became staple foods, the cashew roll being a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which for years was the center of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen comprehension.
While researching the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at midday," Coe says.
Ziegelmann goes on to say, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many household recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 – so fuelled the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and meet the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate prepared ones.
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple stated that when they wrote the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how she couldn't throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windshield incident.
After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe produced a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes with a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glide.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a lookup three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others’ lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far, according to the Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horrors of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the image, "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die saving lives, I think God sees in me a martyr.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, and seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only have offspring at 150 years of age.
The Greenland shark swims slowly along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average distance of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
However, this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a recipe for patents for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" on a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrate animals.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks become stone ageing.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea, looking for carcasses torking down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres long.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lentil core of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is formed even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth, therefore, should be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark, while the record shark at 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation obviously leave at least one and a half centuries time.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrate animals at the moment.
The fact that such methusalems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon a 120-year-old harpoon tip was placed on the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame.
So they mature later – and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of an elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible,” explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on building issues.
With relief, the board accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential buildings can begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying were made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential construction areas "Straßenweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and elderly people alike.
As it was said, construction workers can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the parcels at its September meeting.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly created only in the spring of this year, in sub-divisions.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, for example, the already designated commercial area will be expanded by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It’s very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets competence field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they are sufficient for admission in the UK.
This is what major US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they are moving jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the Risk Council ESRB.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“Being close to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, the infrastructure is worse off.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“It’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a Mercer management consultancy ranking, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33th and Paris 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while 62500 people worked in Frankfurt at the end of 2015.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the Hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages to Merck for violating two patents related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to release the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equate with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership on laboratory work that underpinned sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have regained complete control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing cleanup work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which resulted in an income of $10.75 million for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State reported a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice-presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, along with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton campaigner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retractors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for his refusal a tax audit by the tax authorities.
“You’re on the train,” Clinton campaigner Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it known that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business behavior, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republicans call on Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday as saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is located here, called on Trump to attend a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fear” of voters and not tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return of 2015 showed that they only sourced $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilipeper, fireworks promote Tanzania’s elephant protection
Protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-occupied settlements – they throw condoms at them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for it years ago, along with U.S. conservation, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without hurting animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confidence that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant,” said Honeyguide Damian Bell’s managing director.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned upside down to the ignition line.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
It's usually a bit of a blow to get the elephant out of here.
A final possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold-rained fireworks fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk new building on the St. Goarer Rhine bank
Normally, St. Goar’s investment projects are accepted by traders with kissing hands – after all, it is precisely the retail trade in the core city that is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director beats Berlin hotel because Israeli dialling code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upheaval after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix because it had “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great shame,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and appalled by this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel had “received” the alleged requests of Arab guests.
“Shame you,” another post said, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the allegations and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a direct instruction to not include Israel in the quick election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to separate the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters marched on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate for her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran rose 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
“One could say that last year’s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
On the basis of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded the delivery of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been seized, the police do not inform.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the raid, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations about the robbery at the time of the crime (before 7.45 p.m.) should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Playing and having fun in summertime
The children and young people of the social-pedagogical day group/social group work of the children’s protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers on their summer holidays in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located Freizeitheim Hardtwäldle, the lively group was reunited during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
First, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invites for jumping, swimming and splashing.
Culinary, children and carers were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the Saures Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels were made of pearls and stones or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Bunte Abend".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in probably two years, the Higher Administrative Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally the Bishops of Freiburg decided to visit, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of Mercy at Freiburg’s Münster, which was opened for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Holy Rooms set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrimage blessing.
From Horb, trains were taken to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage route from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were each framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.
But also on the way, the minis rested at crossroads, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from specially compiled pilgrim's songbook together.
For the overnight stays, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the final stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day they started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, because in muggy heat they had to descend about 500 meters and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little momentum we thanked God.
At the Evening Fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home as Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to home a victory from the favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did so in time when hinds showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes was driving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, most importantly, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start, he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England’s rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stands."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that’s a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that’s where successful five days in the velodrome await.
With Kenny’s form, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this just for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted.”
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had fought with officers before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and get a bunch of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland melting plant questionable due to repeal of energy contract
The future of the Portland aluminum meltdown in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to the plant’s operation.
A 20-year subsidy is due to expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelting plant consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s melting plant in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue operating in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity from the smelting plant," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called “security transactions”, which should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"This is why AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL as of GY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had written down the value of the contracts as early as its annual close of $187 million in “expectation of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to debit the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the smelting plant or to ensure the power supply to the smelting plant".
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts a year and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity a year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
And for us as electricity producers that would not be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover’s unveiling was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn’s problem cases and in the presence of the ever-popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they all forgot about a classic cover of one of a surprise:
This is the cliché-like plot of almost every birthday episode of a children’s show (Seacrest brought the phrase, “You thought we forgot you?”, with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting station at 8am), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a circumference that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the Wälzer there were 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been leaking before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more " celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner – who is described by the magazine as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the craps of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the misbehavior seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She runs for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises her Estee Lauder primer.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she can be seen on Reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s aid needs are rejected by community law centers every year, while the industry is focused on the impact of further funding cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence, and those who have no means of unjust decommissioning and the like – are already dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the community, which are already over-utilized, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the community law centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the latest survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already being dismissed each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the Federal Government’s decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away from important services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed – all of these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senators George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centres and their client communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump indicted election campaign after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a firearm at an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that “this would not happen.”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"We don't have to fire weapons to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun lovers — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign clarified that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damages.
Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The trial is called Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: SPD and CDU lose poll before country elections
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red and black government coalition could govern slightly further in the north, this is not possible according to the poll values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to represent the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party is only close to the CDU, which could reach 23 percent again.
The third place is controversial between the Left and the AfD.
The Left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
In spite of slight losses, the Greens are retiring to the Landtag of Schwerin with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was launched 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into the stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
Lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet for a few euros, but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have imagined in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finnish cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by vendors, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere, that’s everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple accounting for 555 million units alone.
Worldwide sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there is the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
In the meantime, an entire industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s triumphal move began, and even today, the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the respite.
They eventually disappeared, BlackBerry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is in charge of personnel at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like it was in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built amidst the two most frequented catwalks in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time to steer that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and Former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are like a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on social networks again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been underway since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; nearly four times as much as in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has targeted ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s social networking and Instagram mobile app, a spokesperson said.
Advertisement on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be rewarding to invest in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preferences tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people’s hands.
Woman overrun on Swiss highway in case of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was hit by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, which asks them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after driving over and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued to rotate.
The model also highlighted the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate lives and protect them from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the Sun for almost two months,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading an inadequate right to participate in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative president/general manager of Colorado’s Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I’ve been thinking long and hard over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his 2013-14 Avalanches debut season as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Work struggles on remuneration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all the parties to the dispute sit down at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," the statement said.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to address the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has fired thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been reinforced by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, created about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
You're spinning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a damaging effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.
In three newspaper reports, Rebull and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversial Baseball Star Resigns
Alex Rodriguez's tears ran faster than the U.S. baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
“I love this game and this team.
“I say goodbye to both,” said the 14-time all-star Major League Baseball (MLB) player.
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of baseball.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the court.
As early as 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, due to an entanglement in the so-called biogenesis scandal, he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could have even done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be in the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy statements from fans of the Yankee arch rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first cases of doping
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.
An athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases were announced at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, these news comes to nothing.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the 50 m freestyle preliminaries.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekova was leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is already positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Bojko Borisov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" also became known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the Danekova case is another severe blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from launching, except for an exception due to systematic doping, the runners-up Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous crimes in China also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang peeling purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese Championships in 2014, but only had to sit a three-month ban.
Data Claw: How perfide hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in this.
According to a recent survey of anti-malware specialists, Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been victims of at least once, in some cases multiple times, of an attack using extortion software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already targets of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators are increasingly specializing their extortion software in attacks on corporate networks, according to the observations of Malwarebytes.
If they succeed there, the potential ransom to be blackmailed is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in a conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
Initially, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks took place in the past few months horrifyingly quickly.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the extortionists.
In order to get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money – mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is at a standstill.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in the operation.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything they can to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers examined user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build some sort of customer service to make more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual extortionists.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
“It comes with a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies who are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations instead,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damages is therefore many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not look narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top is slightly off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l available with raised and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and therefore offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk is easy to load, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.
The steering is likely to be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane-holding assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" during maneuvering.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, slows down the speed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest as much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emissions standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is conceivable only in the case of hazards typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it's a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Illness: When the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was deficient – and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the sea water was in order.
He has not violated his information obligations, according to the judgement.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to contagion among themselves - is a general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must react cautiously and decisively to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase the security and also strengthen the public’s approval of refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in the medium four-digit order over several years."
Sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
The aim is to improve video surveillance and to revise the law on weapons in such a way that it is especially difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
According to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re, the last much discussed duty of silence for doctors should be maintained.
However, he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical community on how to reduce the danger to citizens, he said with a view to psychological abnormalities.
To counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has spoken out clearly against actionism.
"This was a blow to the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on burqa and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be problematic under constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules such as in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens chief executive Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate force and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway accessor
It is regularly piled on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the right-hand lane should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic traffic on the surrounding road in traffic jam every evening when they drive via the motorway accessor (A 43).
The state road construction company will extend the right-hand lane by 700 meters next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße.
Drivers can then thread right from the hammer road.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up more early, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 pm and 7 pm.
On working days, the backlog reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is steered only one lane across the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled well three quarters of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated workday traffic jam will last, the responsible national company cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand lane, the state company deliberately selected the weaker time in the school holidays, because handicaps were to be expected.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the traffic will be one-tracked past the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's Association, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the staging at the Kleiner Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the youth in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of the action anyway, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-shooting guckers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was ill-suited for observing the celestial spectacle due to clouds and rain, said Welzheim Observatory Chairman Hans-Ulrich Keller on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: tips for sleeping disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the alarm ringing.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not restful.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
It is precisely sleeping through that many people find it unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German House Doctors Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another condition.
"Very early waking up is especially common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours, and you may start to think about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: one is tired, tired, unsleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center at Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the GP, advises Weeß.
He can use examinations to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, physicians advise to investigate in the sleep laboratory in case of snoring with respirators, in case of morbid daytime fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Just don’t sleep for lunch,” says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nose glasses, a chest strap and a probe on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws that you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and waking up times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
The former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now defended himself via Facebook from his criticized ex-teammates.
"In a country where an Olympic champion receives €20,000 in prizes and a jungle king €150,000, nobody should be surprised at missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at or even operate on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is the same with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS is not allowed to participate", says the Hamburger Wahl, who now operates an ice cream parlor.
Airport: gangs of baggage thieves arrested
Professional Thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators of the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years.
The suspects had committed several bag and baggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had taken part in it in a joint, part-time and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four crimes to the thieves who had come to Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they had captured over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a rest of cobblestones: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it as one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a gray house.
Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain mentions, are preferably illustrated in the last few weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: it was once occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Henkel, the Berlin Senator for the Interior, has repeatedly advocated a harsh police action against the project, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared on 22 June with 300 police officers, the police reportedly patrolled with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site for three weeks, blocking parts of the road and preventing visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others chat before Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez who, for the most part, wanted police protection from the vandaling left.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between occupants and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the residential projects born from them have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Riga River.
While the Mainz was evacuated under a large police command in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited today by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them now residents from the GDR times and former squatters share their neighbourhood.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by cast-in windows or freshly painted fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, which have been tossed with colour bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year together with the words "left-wing autonomy violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily harm are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are material damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there is no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who probably weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not been around in Riga for quite some time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That’s why it was so important to her that the residents got their street back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation authority over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not of interest to many here - people who are not so well immersed live here," she says.
“Violence and destruction are absolutely unacceptable.”
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, refugee aid workgroup, administration, authorities and anyone else who is involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-legend wool milk sow, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mockingly than aimed at the multitude of desired responsibilities - had meant that the administration wanted to write out the position.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying wool milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent position for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße
For some time now, it has been a serious problem to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It hasn’t worked so far, but it depends on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, community homes need to be built, as they say so beautifully.
So new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and outreach activities for refugees and migrants, which must be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the Bauhof or help caretakers, do charitable work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will have a positive impact.
This is not “employment therapy.”
But work does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, the administration and volunteers jump in.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, is not allowed to work and is useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people with whom nothing goes at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
This is all a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: Do the two fear radicalization after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
However, the helpers are already aware.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would put them in complete disrepute.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, chief and volunteers on site and in the region have to look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to provide them with helpers on site.
"We have not yet reached Urbach where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy with integrating the previous people in a sensible way.
There are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unidentified men entered an apartment in an apartment building in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at around 8.50 a.m.
The inhabitant surprised the two and struck the unhold in flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to investigate.
The search was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the unknowns were noticed before the deed near the apartment or when they fled.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigated after rocker attack on snack

According to the investigators, it is about a dispute in the Ulm rocker environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
