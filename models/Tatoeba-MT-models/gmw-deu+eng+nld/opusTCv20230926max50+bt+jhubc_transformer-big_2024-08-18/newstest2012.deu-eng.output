No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request to abolish, in the context of a amendment to the Penal Code, those paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-premier, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the request for mitigation of penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicted will be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised suspicions of the bias of the court.
The request to remove Paragraph 365, on the basis of which the ex-premier was convicted, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council declared itself to be the customary right of the Sharia, of which one now has a certain conception with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you cut off your hand in short.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, and any faith-refuting people will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an in the future from mutually defensive tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be conceivable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively speaking probably not the best and would hardly fit the variety mentioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even allowed to be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apology, the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a change of shots, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians stripped themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are left with a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the oil companies get the black gold at a mock price even without occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can at last rightly boast of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
If not, the Shari'a representatives will destroy them.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe are the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm blew through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France grew.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and several other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP was expected to grow by 0.5% and France’s by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had originally been expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing economic performance was thus confirmed.
The results are thus worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to experience problems...
The return on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, voices are being heard that the ECB should become a creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the toughest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they were able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who fired two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes onwards, very combative football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so were mainly played around the middle line.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide knockouts in front of the penalty area were successfully resisted by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday noon and subsequently announced the deaths of the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to announce that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has long since apparently not given up its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and subsequently proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan’s target would also be from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It does not eat breakfast and sausages for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, it shows how important for a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had French fries for dinner on the day before the education campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence".
In families with thickets, sport is not exactly one of the favorite activities, but as far as the majority of today’s students are concerned, only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of the school year last year, during which almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic were interviewed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adiposity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with obesity or even obesity.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, reported eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper dinner bread five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
Worst of all was the finding that one in ten families does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that people in the families of overweight children consume much more often unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do – only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own dietary options according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report to this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was also very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get proper information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the enlightening lecture 'Obesity is not a coincidence', in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are quoted.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed poultry or fish much more often as the main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit of a quilt that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn’t even know what was yet to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the apparel of problematic figures and a seminar on how it "runs on the pitch".
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the examination comes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not a single man attends the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
After all, most of us are.
Some have one too short neck, others a too young figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to conceal wide shoulders visually, to extend the neck or to enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a female type like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with a big bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-focused, without making her look too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don't fit, you should at least have a piece of tailor-made.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the rods that always slips up and down, stands in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, thighs, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I’m afraid that given the homework I’ve been assigned, it’s almost impossible to do it.
Each of the students was awarded a celebrity for which she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its type of figure.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently probably increased to a hundred kilos (well, that is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about character types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent in stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But the most important thing for me was the following advice: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to pause all these teachings, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing variants than he ultimately shoots.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to reckon with all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something I look like it is secondary).
And if one of us is already being styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to impose a very different (smaller) size on us than he or she actually needs.
Then all you have to do is google to determine for sure that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assembly" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a sophisticated psychologist.
Assess people without sacrificing themselves and standing up to their opinions.
"If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can't put out the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
“You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what to wear,” Mario says.
He also showed us quite concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, hair removal dispensers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to take pictures of products, such as handbags or hats), special clips, with which the clothing is pulled back in case it is too large (pins or other clamps are forbidden, of course, so that the fabric does not break.
But so that we not only have to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly underglue shoes.
Even when taking pictures in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside one.
We glued and we glued...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be skillful.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me - dedicating yourself to styling on a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree journey becomes a routine journey to the early shift through a series of completely avoidable, dilettant mistakes.
Although it succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions for the most part, what good is that even if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he got on the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged game series "Need for Speed" to a new dimension again and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as one is already used to at NFS, much is in the end different than one expected.
Sure - they are potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is narrowed down by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have the impression that the game would offer the same thing again and again.
Some environments are quite nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But driving through the desert, through autumnal landscapes or high up through deep snowy landscapes is visually very pleasant.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, you have to be careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also interfering, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in concrete terms only three).
Ultimately, this is more of an advantage to the game, because this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above mentioned.
The driving model steps in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is to say, from today’s point of view, although it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, one could not say that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed race will continue to do well for the local driving model, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only appear after a certain amount of time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
It is hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea of how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: when you overtake or pass by oncoming cars, you "strip" the other car only easily in some places, but in other, almost identical situations, you get to sling and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far off the track, you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you have exhausted them, everything starts from scratch.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart does not help, there is nothing more than learning the critical section from the mind.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don’t fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing by two cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparties have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same place and again here without regard to the time.
Most insanely, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to get out of here on devil.
And if he is in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump at first.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly forgets the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost no longer know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilty" it is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change over the course of the races.
Don’t miss out on the petrol stations on the route, because this is where you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American sedans for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of game history, the task mode (challenges) also goes - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from history.
Here you can not only win medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, different items need to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also connected to the Autolog online function, which compares, among other things, the own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you get by car into a subway tunnel (my way), where you rest in the dark on the rails long (my way).
On the speedometer there are numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (meaningly), but there comes a subway from behind and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editors, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to reach as wide a scale as possible to young audiences, a soundtrack was created a l<0xC3><0xA1> "something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren’t diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have asserted with the chest tone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
This is how the game seems unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared to see these mistakes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with vocal ensembles of the Charles University
For the third time, the Festival Festa Academica is offering the interchange of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this, together with the music experience.
Over the course of the festival, the twenty choirs of specialist and university choirs will present themselves.
The main focus of the festival is on the two concerts that take place on November 17.
"The Charles University has a big part in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies is also represented among the participants, and in the festival committee is also the rector V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Hampl," said Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun, head of the organisation team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of technical school choirs, which takes place on November 17 from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazz artist Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".

EU Ambassador Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the individual institutions out of balance."
I didn’t expect such a tough war to burn.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and for everyone to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
In the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the new Permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism got loud that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who didn't grow up to play such a role, but I have to say that it took everyone's breath away from how well he took on the matter.
He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e., as an important step towards the unification and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil hats quart
Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also devoted herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lived and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the government’s case during the presidency as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently in full swing.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And there is still the need to approve the EU’s seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which economic sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which less funding - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's grayish abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know whether you really think of crooked or round cucumbers and different-sized bananas in Brussels or whether someone actually wants to ban us from the quargle?
She would have liked to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in sight
In the opinion of the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and there's a Slovak nearby, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you doing with the heads - is that your V4 again?'
Ms Vicenové said the EU expects tough rules for Member States’ budgetary policies in the future.
She sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more real than a "European federation".
“We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those that don’t want it should stand quietly apart.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately result in a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Ms Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> expects.
In this respect, she also acknowledged the role played by the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you were looking for a suitable word that characterizes IBM’s strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern enterprise, although it has been a century since its inception.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which was started by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and also society over the course of our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director for the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
In the 1930s, Watson was already socially caring for his employees – in a similar way to the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid leave as one of the first American employees, an insurance policy by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out remuneration system for the best newcomers and traders.
Similarly, IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are ingenious.
The company was ingenious in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies in the world to lift any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will be alternated with a woman next year at the head of IBM is also – by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, because almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM isn’t a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems with technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to directly shape it through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo for its familiar "Big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM holds the most patents, and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the floppy disk.
With approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (equal to Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you can’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leaving them again.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely driven by services, software and hardware, each contributing one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still the strongest with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time, it has invested $58 billion in purchasing future-oriented technologies.
IBM continues in these investments even after 2008, when the current financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today’s crisis unharmed.
Since 2008, the value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in a rocket-like manner and the company’s net profit has grown continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is that everything can be changed – only the values don’t.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflights
Founded one hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous linchpin clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the rival company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader even overshadowed IBM’s founders – based on Watson’s ideas to date, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all sorts of machines for trade – from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four decades when Watson led the company, he doubled its revenues to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of the time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered fully into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of “Smart Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas that have not yet been planned, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in the city administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Headquarters is located in Prague and is also home to a top-level team of world-class researchers working on the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became a lover of the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with the patience and for the further life she has set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> offered refuge to singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in her own house, she probably wouldn’t have even dreamed of how this would end with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days at her insistence, Joseph immediately went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, yes it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a human being with whom I still have certain ties," Ms. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> revealed; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and consisted solely of mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Joseph so far bears with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes that."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company is still running, I'm taking care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'm making the purchases."
"With Darina I am talking normally, only we do not share the bed," said J. Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he does not want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: what about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female vices, they shake some out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we pass a few unsitts revue again, which let the men swell the blood in the veins?
Purchasing addiction
Does their husband accuse them of being shopping addicts?
Do you need to buy at least one Hader per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more for promotions?
In your case, it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire half under control.
But hand in hand, what woman can stand looking for a well-fitting outerwear just to stroll through a clothing store and not to try out all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - you better stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Oh, yeah?
Then you are probably one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This doesn’t mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly whining about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and do this at least twice a week.
Do you grumble with your partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, do you scold the children, because the just shaved sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, where the polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviant" then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This excessive purity fungus can ultimately also harm mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty gymnastics pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that that brings him to the palm.
Clearly, that's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and kick, they get hugged or even slandered behind their backs or they forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to haggle through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with claptails of the coarsest caliber, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which pose a considerable danger, especially for women’s collectives.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr played a big part in the NHL Monday match with two assists in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the same match were also recorded by Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr claimed to journalists after the game that he had prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Before the game, I'll tell him that he's going to make a hat-trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"Secondly, such a feeling comes over and over again," explained J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the puck behind the Hurricanes’ gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the start of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr said in a statement.
"I wouldn't have imagined in life that at the end of my career, I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as with him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I'll cut my game to myself."
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates set their game on me and now the skewer is turning around," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr smiled.
Carolina made the game a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellently acted Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up ride and (Read) pulled to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the match from his point of view.
This victory put Philadelphia at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also suffered an undiscovered lead in Penalty Shooting 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to transform one of the penal shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they played the game with only five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We ended the encounter with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing to do, we have to deal with that,” said Jacques Martin.
"With each change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec fired thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and only select people were allowed to go to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge snakes or also sleep in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good friends" in the travel agency.
That was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for an exit to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West without the commitment of foreign exchange.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox that is no longer known today is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation in the neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park when they traveled to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or in a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to freely buy the Western currency.
Our level of living and, as a result, the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips through charter flights, making air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currencyless payments with all the advanced countries of the world, making travelling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-samten" travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter planes with Czech passengers fly to far-away sunny countries; this year you fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday, including the costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is expected to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement on which electoral order to be elected.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his position, prompting his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old rallies between the two chambers of association broke out again, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result, and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
In this single point, agreement was reached, at least in part, to which also the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law contributed, whose opinion a representation on a power of attorney basis was not valid.
However, the disputes over the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring more clarity to the matter, and in principle nothing else is on the agenda at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary.
Even though opinions about the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a patting situation?
"The issue concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side in turn insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees with this, even if it turns out that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical replacement variants are invented, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements mainly distinguished himself from Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which, among others, Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not even start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the Barrage play.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is to show the Czech sport the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsner football team before the extraordinary general meeting, could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of Chairman only for one year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football.
“I spoke personally with some of the people in question.”
“It’s hard to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football right now.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is seen behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate voting at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to have Pelta hold the position of Chairman.
"In his victory, the current state would be preserved and in Czech football there would be no progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, gets football twice as bad," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that some time ago Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone interrogations for investigation into a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees a little more calm.
However, should Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k win in the Thursday election, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could well imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who had caused a stir in September that he was behind the dismissal of the referee's commission with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela at the head, replacing Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels he has grown into the role of the association’s chairman.
And he relies on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
As one of his priorities, he would see the consolidation of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should dedicate himself to."
“When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also have to cling and clearly say where the money is going,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
“But it doesn’t make much sense in my opinion to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which will rule out a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make a strong effort to ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will receive new statutes that will in future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely defuse in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the extraction of funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it's high time that the association is led by someone, says the man, who is primarily affiliated with the Jablonecer club, but who also served for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That is why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is responsible for today’s problems with the election.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Union that he used as a lure for the delegates.
“If I should become chairman, I would take it personally and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
"It's a fundamental thing he can't be without," Pelta said.
He does not attempt to separate himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could envision a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, which he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also stopped attacking Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been around for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"His attacks were degrading, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the causa bohemians to the resounding corruption scandal of last year."
“I would then rush to negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football,” the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel clearances.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is comprehensible nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If really the only contentious point is how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
"Football needs credibility, and it only wins it back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta said in a statement.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly avoid the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in case of his choice, you will start to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to youth performance football."
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything on my own,” Rajchl said in an interview for <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and I therefore want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will be distributing hard tasks so that football progresses in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted with this, because instead of merely criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he considered not to run at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me that I shouldn't give up, because otherwise others would."
"It's trust that you can't waste," he said.
He also allegedly motivates him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw it away.”
"Proceeds have been launched that probably only come into effect in a few years and I would not like to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
You can blame me for something, but not that I’m biased.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even though some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then each rose to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl says.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
“I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” Rajchl said, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to give Czech football new confidence," he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated, and the staffing in the commissions would obviously not fundamentally change."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl judges his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
by Julia Stanek
Ufo-optic paddling pools, pompous pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, swam towards marble putts waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
Liked a bath, she quickly recorded it in her notebook - along with interesting details about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": folk swimming halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn’t have much on her hat with sports, says Meder – only in the water is that different.
It’s just annoying that swimming fans have to settle down with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chanting in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based medical doctor.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashes in the plunge pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And when the builders have put in effort, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "In baths, instead of a floor, you have a water surface."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
On 190 pages, the small-format book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in J<0xC3><0xA1>zs).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you can watch the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
It vaporizes from three upwardly open shells in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, while the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells so strongly of heating oil that it is hard to believe that it has landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose sluice sticks to your skin as soon as you glide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds swelling between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decline has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed this bath; you can discover not only Neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite bath of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It is already a feat to merge such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agro-Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business scrutinize
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank quit its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the chief executive wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and the banks therefore bear a co-debt for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Initially, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand – and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to review the allegations and said no business was “worthy of jeopardizing Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks today harm the common good."
Ackermann is now particularly in duty as the top banking lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank has to remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann's concern about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to avoid possible losses, he hardly needs to shear himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers facilities where prices for food are wagered.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and a happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and perished.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up in the Swiss Garden near the Vienna South Railway Station after the World Exhibition, rebuilt and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21 house" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a bliss in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has made the new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with considerable careers, among others in youth as a figure skating artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, insisted on the reconstruction with politicians and conservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop were to exist, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “enormously important place” for him, where he had seen the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in generosity and ease when he moved to Vienna and re-used it.
There were far greater problems with the current renovation: the building was "an energy thrower," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for new use, a lowered light trench between house and street provides exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown anti-rust shade.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office," says Krischanitz and points to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It had been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz has recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban development happiness: Around the Swiss garden is the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another lucky case will perhaps occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Train plans million-dollar winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway lines and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches within operation.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with the government and industry, Bahn-Chef Rüdiger Grube warned about train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railways Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making it happen for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne’s main station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fine in the United States
After the turmoil over chief Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars in fines there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant now also catches up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of misleading cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value during the financial crisis and plunged the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any debt with the comparison.
The same goes for Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in on pleadings to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the resulting billions of dollars in damages replaced.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also tapped other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a fatality to a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers flipped over.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years now, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the US.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek reparation or punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
She accuses 18 major international banks of over-benefiting two state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in around $200 billion in mortgage transactions.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, which deals with several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters face "substantial losses", without mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, American investor Warren Buffett had always said that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could only be predicted poorly.
However, he has now read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly provides services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's blow in the financial world.
Accordingly, the IT-origin IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a shareholding of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which, even in the economic crisis, had still made good profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders, for example.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and turned it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM stock rose pre-market by one percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange in total, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now resurrected.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded to in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, a ghost has long since been believed dead: Since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" titled the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted in a wise manner: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, this was staged together - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media acts like a slap in the face: "Germany's Gift to the Fiftyth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which talks about the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken away from this mental connection.
“It starts to stink,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their later search success are discussed extremely critically.
Why the German authorities did not think it was much more likely to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some of them are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: “If slurred here, the migrants will have nothing left but self-defense and armament.”
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the inner peace in Germany," writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s illustrate.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks sharpened our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral ceremony in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive enlightenment and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time open words are needed.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let's judge a German.
That’s not what Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity, and left friendly comments about its future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything was going to be different.
A UBS dealer in London had circumvented all of the bank’s security systems and swindled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as a challenge - and everyone is asking: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012 onwards.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the Board of Directors as early as May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and certainly would have needed a training period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it deserves the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, UBS is huge – until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world – and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She combined the image of the secretive and solid Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, as an investment bank, she advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I always presented UBS to my students as a pattern of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you wonder, how could I be so wrong?"
He made a huge mistake.
In 2007, it was revealed for the first time that something went wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment business had cheated on subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion.
For this, she actually found investors, however, which, until recently, would have been the nose over: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so silent that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second best paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS faced the collapse in view of its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland’s economic output (see graph).
“Once again, we could not save the UBS,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have undermined taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million – as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty charge.
Thus, the UBS more or less openly confessed to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both key business areas: investment banking through misconduct and asset management through tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as it was thought, now UBS will get it back, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single trader cheats 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out: Risk management in investment banking obviously still doesn’t work.
"With the Adoboli case, one had to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it has no control over risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the world’s great fortunes: no too great risks, but security for money – even beyond the Alpine Republic, if the world were to collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewels such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, in addition to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has supplanted both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to CHF 68 billion, or around EUR 45 billion, was granted by the politicians to save the large bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined forces to form a massive group.
A bank emerged that was already too big for the small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS helped to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, humble, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that excess came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs kicking off the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go to the top.
A few steps had already been taken.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the top.
However, management consultants who were hired highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banker language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It evolved into a massive machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks had long been looking to quit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS became a slingshot seat and are wobbly to this day.
Those who run the big bank now have an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking should shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3,500 jobs are removed.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to ask.
So far, he has only said that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe strains U.S. stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Throttled industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was considered half-full last week, not half-empty – but now the problems have again come to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values recorded at the close of the trade by a minus of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer commuted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is set to end the upswing.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” Goldman’s Steve Goldman said.
Europe will not be able to liberate itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
In his view, it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and made it at first slightly one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silvered almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and scrapped $6.6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institute primarily wants to boost its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the company had collected the largest order in its history.

719 values increased, 2281 declined and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, sowing crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural escape of the specially protected crows: the chemical use in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others, in Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the trapping of the animals in bird traps and the killing with bats as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grumbling, does nothing," the urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer noted.
Spraying nests away with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Exacerbation is only possible as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable to combine the abrasions of the animals from sensitive living areas and lure offers in order to resettle them elsewhere.
"Infoboards instead of chainsaws", the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, promoted a completely different approach to the animals: "After all, we can best endure a pimple in the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, on which signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticizing the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested at four crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without a lot of training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire to them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do so right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will be present at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have made the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship participation perfect after the 0-0 out of the first game.
The Czechs reached a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off back against outsider Montenegro, after the first game (2-0) had already been a clear matter.
There was nothing left to burn even Croatia in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored further goals for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trading meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to the early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a header to the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, the focus was on referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion made everything clear with four goals.
Petr Jiracek also finished the final doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the European Champion of 1976 has been competing in the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second of terror in the initial phase.
Finalist Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty limit just past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get above a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to vacate his place on the bench of the World Cup Third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the second of terror, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his way to Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with the 4-0 success in the first game.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) made up for the guests.
Ireland pressed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian back team prevented the possible leadership hit.
In the 32nd minute, it was time.
After an accidental defense of finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on his way and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

Police officers arrested the drunk for a short time, the boy had to be picked up by the grandfather.
The tram driver was slightly injured.
Garbage container lit in the wedding
Unknown people set fire to garbage containers in a backyard in the wedding on Saturday night.
As the police said, a neighbor noticed the fire at midnight and at the same time watched two darkly dressed men flee across the adjacent cemetery wall in Steegerstraße.
The fire brigade was able to quickly extinguish the fire.
Hungriger Labrador turns on stove top - apartment fire
A hungry dog probably triggered a house fire in Brandenburg/Havel.
The Labrador probably jumped on the stove to get food, police said on Friday.
He probably moved the switch and turned on a plate.
Paper on the stove caught fire.
The apartment on the fourth floor of an apartment building was on fire on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died of flue gas poisoning.
The 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is being investigated for negligent arson.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, will invest billions in China in the next few years and almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) are expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," Co-CEO Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP plans to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had saved around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathically and generously begins Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Terror: A History of the First World War, Narrated in Nineteen Fates" with a long list of main characters that goes to heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do it: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund’s romantic narrative, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like Englund’s, are lost men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not inaccurately describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important contracts, or famous battles, and there are few ambassadors, raging reporters, or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost combined the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund’s book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee hives, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"False facts," Englund notes, "were furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in Englund’s in-depth collection of small moments.
Many of them deal with deficiency and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in barley fat (and most recently served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes soaked with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own urge for ferocity and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all this, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and pretending that such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade means civilization and that there is no barbarism behind your own reinforced and battered shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
“When you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beastarium of the still young century": "the word skillful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in dimensional suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexual disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal eggs, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like that," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read in a non-fiction book.
I'm not giving it here anymore.
But it is as if he had snatched us away with his book this page with the main characters in front of his nose and lit it with a match.
After an early failure, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing mission helmets.
The night had been chosen from Monday to Tuesday because there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, all others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the diocese and gave the occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing occupations being handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials intensified the so-called chaos training – counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke of a declaration as "exercise."
“The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” someone who wanted to remain anonymous said.
"The only people who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then withdrew when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including deployment commandos from all over the city – hundreds of mobile officials usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people go in and out in the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages, which roared from the speakers, seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue windjackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson for the president of the police, said this had been done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they were trying to stop them from observing the police actions in the park, and they said the officials’ handling was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
As the police moved to the west through the big mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, her employees followed the city cleaning, which picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park's position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests, he said, came because of "unfair behavior and resistance to an arrest."
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not conduct the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed that from these locations the police expanded the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s worst-paid employees and lost their jobs in a move on 7 October, have described the union leader as political revenge for denying the city access to a health fund that the working groups maintained, with which the budget gap was closed, last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing by the City Council, School Director Dennis M. Walcott said last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that the budget did not specify that employees would be fired from school aid.
City Council officials said they had and warned the Department of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will feature Mr. Walcott and the city’s education ministry as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Justice, said the city would not face the lawsuit and thus could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in the city’s poor quarters to support a lawsuit for inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
She argues that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were fired.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of underprivileged parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were lost as the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred," the lawsuit said.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations passed a resolution under the leadership of President John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their “courage.”
"This resolution honours the brave people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House debated the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the US military’s role in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, the bill was passed in the Senate, and the Board passed a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory—with a congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama’s missionary approach, but not angry enough to finally pull the floor under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board, or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The last version comes with the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double – the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate – others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet budget change in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish up their resume - the opportunity to brag about having "committed" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex couples, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As diligently as members propose changes, so do they move much faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Affected but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an electoral event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening, singing alone for the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ran for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, “Very good.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the couple's release of the new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8 assassination.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Gifford whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congressman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy a day, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read to Gifford an article from a daily newspaper about the assassination on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged Sagittarius Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forcibly treated as he waits for his trial.
“Many people have died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife’s recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, “I was hit.”
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated'?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, who was watched, among others, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really, it was pity.
The very contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were harming the people in uniform.
“We were by no means a victim,” said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the rage that struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “enraged, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and, upon his return, took over a senior state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly due to the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely picked out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as was absolutely common during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack through rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a military court of rape.
If it does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit they have brought against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and violated the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn, or prosecute an appropriate case law.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of having all plaintiffs put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department team, led by state prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss a lawsuit.
The court’s files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be prosecuted by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
When women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three other complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a women’s hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received to dismiss them from service – a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, in which it accused her of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted independently to Congress through a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Department of Defense.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole range of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge and was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought the labors would begin. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is advancing is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first called into question.
I have always been a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them that they try.”
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will start with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a July murder in Norway in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it was not difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – as marketers have for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking up with a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, their attitudes towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don’t reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
"With Facebook, it all goes away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full intoxication on Facebook were significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent about this subject.
Moreno suggests that peer-to-peer students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you didn’t realize it,” Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook is also constantly collecting data from its own people.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data find available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. In order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined students' public pages on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the details in a user profile and in posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research needs to take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway,” he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, he said the authorities will closely monitor all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was behind the lock and the lock.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would end up in a lockdown.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I've seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre hint that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
It may please some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” the victim’s relative said.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Deceased Steve Jobs Showed in a Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the tech genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans find perhaps most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer who diligently crafted diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialist Idiots" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used in expert idiots, he says the interview’s copy templates were missing at delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs appears here surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side actions of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow eeriely far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and represent his own vision for the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs, but seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who’s on the brink of grandeur is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this, he moved on and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
No one knows why he does what he does, no one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astounded by how costs were recorded—usually starting with “standard costs” that were calculated on the mere presumption and then adjusted with “deviation”—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
As the Pope was proclaimed:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, as they loop through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times and when you grinned into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs says giggling.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were as good as they could to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brownish tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember persuasive arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are declining:
Long before resurrecting Apple, Jobs predicted the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, na and?"
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so it’s those people who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft had been in the 1990s.
You've got defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether to listen to a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became the buzzword among conservative activists across the U.S.
The judges agreed to the hearing, in fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to boost the result of the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be tipped will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under George W. Bush’s government.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the Federalist Society’s annual dinner, an established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that contests the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is heavily involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted on the case.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events close to law and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, honorary guest or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
“This astounding break with morality and the opposition to the Code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dine during a beneficial event with lawyers with floating trials at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor-general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case for bias, as she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any arrangements to do so.
Boeing to land record $18 trillion
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record sum of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest ever commercial aircraft order on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-run Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, according to Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show, an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which is usually damaging to airlines as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“You have a natural security,” he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership in the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus’ competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Seems to Lose Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for the governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied ballot booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently still in office governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unfortunate left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates left the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look bravely into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downtrend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking “passionately” at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support from Europe’s leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
“If China and India can help, then by all means.”
Europe’s monetary union has been experiencing a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest costs have increased dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fuels fears that the global economy could plunge into the recession and has led to cries that the leading emerging economies must join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing big challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, more than 800 million of whom live for $2 or even less a day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-inducing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth rate of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/now threatens "the risk of gradation" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downtrend and a significant capital outage of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress cannot close its spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts, as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certainty limiting probability in order to reach the target."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who uphold our military and seriously harm our alertness."
The cuts were ultimately to hit the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the confiscation does not directly affect the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism struggle, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings were being shortened, which would lead to delays in attitudes and attitude oversight that would support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a Department of Defense seizure would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly not one that should be forced on us."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly voiced the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be coming - a military with shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is an armed force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to engage with potential opponents."
“She really makes you angry.”
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and eligibility, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter aircraft F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If the F35’s further development and testing were stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but supporters say it’s an important next step towards armament so that potential dangers from China and other opponents can be banned.
How to Debunk a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, and both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of perjury, allegedly holding back reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, nobody who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have specified the exam responses to their students so that they could stand up well even in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a societal game such as Sharaden, where the goal is to call “Hab dich!”, debunking a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They don’t always stutter, stalk, blush, and twitch.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years researching the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing field of debunking, and it is clear that debunking a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find our way around in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing one’s own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arouse their interest and master their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more likely to go on "self-orientated" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others"—usually, they want to protect the feelings of others—that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat."
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an offender, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of that person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for evaluating changes at a later date.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
They should know better when someone usually constantly triples with the foot, so they don’t wrongly accuse him if he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of debunking.
People who are deceiving may solidify when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often mistakenly signal that an interview is over, only to keep an eye out for this relaxation after the interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slippage is famous when he used the past form, when he claimed his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer becomes perceptive rather than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to scream.
There is no magic tool for debunking lies, but you can learn skills that enable debunking.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can rarely fall victim to fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline to be revised after endangered by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, annoying the unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to replan the project so that it can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course that avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, was reviewed.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the State Department and promised his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline became a link between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who are opposed to the plan, weigh up the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer region, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State’s current environmental impact study found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy says that the Ministry’s principal auditor has requested a separate probe of the review procedure that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had been given a rabies attack that so frightened her little daughter that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the “Lady Marmalade” singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from “personality changes, sleep disorder” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to set off for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter off near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you're saying or thinking.'"
She became angry and began to grumble - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'See what you did to my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle rushed to the mother who still wore Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her accompaniment and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he doesn't charge a fee and the family is planning to donate the money they get to child cancer care.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is presented to a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change has slowed the economy
In the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez is in the government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history. It is the first year in which Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and fuelled great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, due to climatic adversities, growth cannot be talked about, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused million-dollar losses in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the national economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, of which 78.03 percent have been completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent have been partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity up to November has steadily increased unemployment in the Mexican state 96. The Instituto Nacional de Estad<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geograf<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the first working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 6.28% in the following quarter.
Lower liquidity
The economics scientist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Aut<0xC3><0xB3>noma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the budget cuts passed by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally pile up dollars, it is not easy to make them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration Stopped
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the immigration problems and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
Black labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 per cent of the country’s employees who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Security Institution) and the Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a del Trabajo y Previsi<0xC3><0xB3>n Social (Governmental Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesos by September, which is much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the strongest drop in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011, with ADI of $630 to $597 from January to June, a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Desarrollo Econ<0xC3><0xB3>mico del Gobierno (Governmental Agency for Economic Development) for its part has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debts
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied for a loan of 3 000 000 pesos to the National Congress in July to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be detected by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdé’s government incapacity obvious.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, Chairman of the C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n (Mexico State Chamber of Manufacturing), said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the various sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year, and hard work has to be done to regain the land lost this year, and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and especially the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez commented that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the economic development of the country.
"The low flow of economics is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Re-defining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, declared that the state must be led to more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to re-determine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government’s efforts to a better path.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the commercial possession of marijuana.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road opposite the guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer rode in a white van, storing a black bag in a box in the car and a small backpack in the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the detainee is still in the detention centre.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings provided for in the H<0xC3><0xA1>bitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 programmes for migrants run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The head of the city’s Social Development Authority stated that although the building programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it has to pay for the three programs exceeding 11 million peso.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federaci<0xC3><0xB3>n and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and although they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, which was the amount that the central government should have raised.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, and the programs continued, and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not used to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had been requested to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The court approves the 2015 transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and House of Representatives against the Presidential Order, which require the transition from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to contest the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Legislative Decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order for the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality, thus the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, it was proposed that the Legislative Decree be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are governed by the Comisi<0xC3><0xB3>n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Legislative Decree would be inconsistent by the hierarchical principles.
In favor of the project, only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree.After the adoption of the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action filed by the Chamber of Deputies without taking part in the debate on the project, for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed his disapproval of the project’s arguments in the sense that the state government is not allowed to regulate by general regulations the measures that the public administration should take.
"I don't think that if you do that, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body." She also recalled that for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because it is the government that manages state affairs.
Replacing the analogue signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better utilization of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal, and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which was a decision in the public interest that not only had technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transition through the government, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in the powers of Congress with the issue of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th, the Electoral Office adopted a series of rules to harmonise local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his electoral justice law to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this round of elections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and assessed the voice of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" because he does not have the right to "determine or veto it."
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the ballots.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes of counting and calculating of votes are not available, or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee, or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed ballots can take place if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the one who is in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman who is the second of the aforementioned candidates.
Vote counting can also be carried out in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the electoral packages subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés flooded to Saltillo, his birthplace, on Sunday evening. On Monday, the show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant's last will was for his ashes to be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force, taking part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel landed on the mourning hall on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technical Institute of Saltillo, which was prompted by his former fellow students of the technical high school and his American football team, to whom Felipe Bacio was a member during his preparation for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck, but he was always striving to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n to graduate from his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A Last Farewell
The lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was greeted with honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, honoring him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, head of school and student of the technological education institution of Saltillo, where he studied excellently as a sports student in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew crashed, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were also sitting.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the outskirts of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his pupil Cristina, his mother, and his teacher, were waiting for him.
The abandoned corpses were found on a plot of land on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The event had taken place at kilometer point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide open.
Looking into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him lay another, dressed in a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information obtained on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, since no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions that write an organized gang of criminals to another, as well as several shots in the wall and door were found.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor, who was part of a criminal gang mainly in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (hunting of humans) and secret funerals.
According to public information, eight people were first arrested and one prisoner released on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured and the detainees confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6:00 a.m., soldiers found a car with no number plates with two inmates on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military saw him.
They are charged with secret funerals in the towns of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
He is expected to introduce a cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
“I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner said.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Europolitics in order to regain the strained confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hasten, which weighs on Monti, was further exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7% interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would fully support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a government made up of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on Montis with its statement that a failure is a catastrophe.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
Tuesday evening, the session will be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief breathing at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a hint of their concerns over the process imposed by the pressures of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bult.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 contestants has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match, which takes place today at 3.05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection matches, the three-coloured team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish Fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cups are added.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We’ll see how the Spanish team draws their last record: Iker Casillas, who reached a tie last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play today against the tricolor team and Spain will set a new record of 127 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The number Hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He was followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five out of over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
There were fewer than 30 matches in Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var recorded only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet made their debut.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was confirmed by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they perform at the National Stadium starting at 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve been playing in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted and they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry for taking so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played at a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we love the jungle, which is why Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set ourselves any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we're going to play isn't easy.
If we add two or three songs that we haven’t played in a while, we can keep our focus better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years, which looks like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and love to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all value ourselves happy to be still alive and moreover, we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better off.
Your relationship with fame hasn’t always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it created without being obsessed with being a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built up the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh and to share a lot of themes and music.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her works, especially Eddie Vedder, and have chosen the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he remembers.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are some songs on the new album that might seem a little lighthearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them, they were very dark songs.
I think as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neopl<0xC3><0xA1>sicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want it because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated on four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight, along with other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Direcci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la polic<0xC3><0xAD>a detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n next Wednesday, which, according to the Uruguayan president, will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "suits for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries, and since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has been trying to speed up the concretization of tax information exchange agreements to be removed from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s “grey list,” which includes countries that have not implemented all international tax cooperation standards.
On a business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The moustached installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the store counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be used to play three-dimensionally without a special pair of glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the person responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain, said in a statement.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the very beginning" because hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations to existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesperson underlined that, although it is three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less talented users.
Afterwards, the experts can "turn a second round" over the various levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The moustached installer has to overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of Portillo to the United States
Guatemala’s president, <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom, announced Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to be held accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
This is how the trial of the U.S. request for the extradition of Portillo ends, so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision was based on the independence of judiciary and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his administration and had accepted all requests for extradition that he was informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n is extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which was prior to extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during the election campaign periods demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councilor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalonian Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the La Caixa Savings Bank, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation.”
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was vacated
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they held illegally and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to desperation. The eviction took place on a court order without police intervention.
After evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The occupants, who occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them, painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, lasting up to two days, driving tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the line-up.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the occupants made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been reported by the neighbors for trouble with rest, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the occupants and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, became more and more in the last few weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the Popular Party (PP) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, demanded that the building be vacated immediately and that the problems of civil coexistence and the demise of the district be dealt with.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in recent months, the squatters had penetrated all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in some even theft.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral Street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people invade the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The city tender on the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-disappeared Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its libel on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the downfall of the CMB in 1987, the park, in the eyes of many, became the upper limit of Barcelona again, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread north-south, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a model now served no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of Yogibear.
So far, in September, the city issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's going to put gates on the land.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
Not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city is the topic of discussion at the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n "it is necessary" to talk about the "front at the mountains" after the attack on the coast, insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who over the green apples, has not been carried out.
“One should assume the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," the architect, for whom the title "Tor of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not "imagine it as an access to a park, but as a limitation of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with urban development experience, considers the proposal to be an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty that the design of a public space today entails" according to the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one’s own limitation on what may be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” i.e. crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who adheres more closely to the question, says simplified that the side of Collserola, which is heading towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not heading towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "spoil on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment on".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guideline that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("exactly the right one," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the axis Mountain Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective looking at the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this resulted in him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length is equipped in such a way that a soft transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino awards Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red representative freed the mayor of Monterrey's brother from trial for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is released after the Casino Red’s representative has pardoned him before the District’s Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico had dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention centre for allegedly bribing the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while remaining in the middle security tract for only a few hours because of threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an inmate of the city prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretary of the District's Second Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, sent him a detention order, finding that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to blame Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
On Monday, Casino Red’s deputy, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, requested Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to release the sentence, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer withheld the name.
According to the case 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is free to speak, nor can any objections to the proceedings be made in the following, nor can any compensation be demanded.
After hearing the representative of the betting house about 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, drove to the city prison of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come announces details of the plane crash in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretar<0xC3><0xAD>a de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter, with its entire intact structure, could have crashed directly to the ground without the pilot causing an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions had been suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing its hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, director general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and relief services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at a speed of travel during the impact and that the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at launch, and during the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds were rising.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match, and there may not have been a loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Distributing the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter was impacted to the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
Aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level during the on-site investigations, with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search on an area that went beyond the locked area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had been impacted against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institution) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Unidad de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Médica en Bioqu<0xC3><0xAD>mica (department of medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigaci<0xC3><0xB3>n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to take part in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and will continue on the sports ground of Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he declared that it would be aimed that three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of six and 14 should fill out nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on the Saturdays mentioned, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was monitored and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health personnel about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican on average is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would be determined whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and on the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
UNAM asphalt prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, developed polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention was paid to the signs emanating from the pavement, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico) breaks out, Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warned or assured that the number of potholes would be significantly reduced.
In his lecture "Battleholes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthens.
Tough-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., it is very viscous at 120° C. and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible road surface, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on to it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a last layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water, "because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates into the layer and only difficult to exit, causing a softening of all layers of the road surface and consequently the appearance of potholes.
When a impact hole is created," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only impaired afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico’s National Research System) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be relative to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example about asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be happy to be on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico took the crown (1989), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Gir<0xC3><0xB3>n Gar<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Gir<0xC3><0xAD>a Ospina Benoit (1947), Gir<0xC3><0xAD>a Dom<0xC3><0xAD>a
The big question that many people are asking themselves today is: What was missing?
After all, the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite, who had shown at every demonstration that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she was elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles also given to the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the crown of the Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is crucial to the jury’s decision to appoint her as the First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?” asked by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing myself, in the end I think that the book that most shaped my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather profound book.
I am currently reading 'Debt and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
A response that met with little anti-love, first because of the concept of “civilizing” and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each book mentioned by her had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all the people: Please read a little <0x60>The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A Bogota-based journalist suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience voting on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage."
And that was noticed in her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed safely with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not eventually become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury regarding her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derrier and fibrosis, which were noted to her in the stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queen's coach, Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the abdomen, which was frankly hard to notice for me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she had undergone.
"Operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to let her do them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and that place she had to pay for it."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was supposed to come true at night. It was tampered with that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had missed the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lophoscopist from the prosecutor’s office (CTI) in Cali entered the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): “Alfonso Cano” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had been on standby, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in communities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is subject to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two corpses, and that there was suspicion that one could be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was supposed to take the ten-finger print of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his actual name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the examiner, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, because this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, was not wearing glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body’s fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He said it was “Alfonso Cano.”
That same night, this Puerto Tejada man was in charge of informing the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a dactyloscope of the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n in Cali, the tribute given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identification documents or they do not have one.
We take the fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprint removal, but in this case we were able to take the whole hand's print and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a planting cell or ribbon is used to take away.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, the criminal database, or to the registry office.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without IDs,” said the CTI’s expert.
He said not everything was the same as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, so not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The "indignants" challenge New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters crowded in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Much followed the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this Tuesday when they tried again with a court order to enter the Manhattan Square after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "indignant" to re-tend at this location, while another part of the movement held to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the pitch, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesman for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of their camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent eviction of the square and authorized the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "Emperors" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have arrived at this location, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will analyse the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the out-of-court protesters carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, and even gave them to some policemen guarding the place, resulting in “some small clashes,” Bray reported, who indicated that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear in front of the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of the Zuccotti Square carried out at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators "violate the right."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to clear the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people," because "some businesses had received threats" and residents "feared for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not the interests of North American workers," the movement's spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "disrespecting the freedom of the press."
Occupy Wall Street officials informed that they were thinking about organizing “great actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have now lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is on the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on December 1st in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
Today, CTV shared pictures of the television program in which Anderson - which is also used for the distribution on the internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that Jesus is supposed to portray.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" appears as a Jesus Child.
CTV’s Christmas program relies not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently described North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still recovering from the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s first estimates in Tokyo estimated the property damage to be $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three-quarter cases, the figures for the gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The resurgence can partly be explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - turned into one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the cloudy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the export companies' accounts.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen’s listing.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes would have been pulled at the greatest economic potentials.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further straying into the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly being demonstrated by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days agreed upon at his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would by no means withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos said in a statement yesterday, announcing the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not clear doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The Conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse a commitment to the fulfilment of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu’s referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties “were not signing a clear written agreement as soon as possible”.
Ministry of Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said that the Troika inspectors were coming back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government what "needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a predominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide".
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the past two decades, Spain has become the world's second donor to this means of international cooperation, whose "being" is based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in people".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "particularly the goal, therefore, the number of people living with incomes of less than a dollar" must be below the "limit"
Spain "continues to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have seen many successes" and "have faced many challenges."
The summit on micro-credits is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the impetus of "two fundamental goals".
The Queen said it would aim to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe continuous development," the Queen explained, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday's assessment as "the head of the family" in Valladolid and as "the advocate of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical requirement” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez felt that microcredit was a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty,” and that the governments of the industrialized states would now have to work “more than ever” according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success of" "marginalized" people "who are always at closed doors" "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the present in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14th) was held in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's presidency proposal, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, and ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and was initially valid for Angela Merkel and a few hours later for Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention regulations, leaves no doubts on the part of the three European-affiliated finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, as well as the motions, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which reinforces the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the eurozone; but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote, "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the motions adopted by Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal of each country’s weighting on the Governing Council according to the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously entailed a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is looking to calm the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer attempted to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European request for the importance of "German-French friendship" dedicates a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud in disease reports represent?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family subsidy fund and to present a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy under a tough test, but on the other hand represents no less forerunners of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is targeting the introduction of a fourth day of nursing before taking into account an illness report to employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days without the specific company’s permission, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to evoke anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", but would help to raise 280 million euros.
And this was accompanied by another rather symbolic measure: to grant state officials an unpaid cardinal day in case of illness (so far, unlike the three days in the private sector, there is no cardinal period for them).
While these issues are in the discussion, the majority are also once again sparking the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and beyond that, they will be repaid if demanded," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, before the RTL microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports seems somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no more likely to be ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
But first, let’s look at the national figures.
According to the state health insurance company CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, the daily allowances in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion, representing 5% of the health expenditures.
Among this amount was 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health care expenditures.
In 2010, the French received an average of only 14.5 days of sickness compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
Another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, Career Planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers said they did not take a single day of sickness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to be incapacitated no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the case of sick reports represents a very small proportion in terms of black labour.
With regard to fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 entails that there are systmatic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, under 1.5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease reports realized, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days, less than 1.2 million were 11% of "unadapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a sick report.
A number that represents only a weak dimension compared to, for example, that of black labour.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of an expert report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, November 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced before Parliament that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were insufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the prime minister said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence of Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the eurozone was "at stake", as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to lower the country's government deficit "to lower the 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but forwarded that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at a meeting of members of his New Democracy Party.
He had agreed with the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic upswing.
Olli Rehn, an EU commissioner entrusted with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantee by all parties on their support of the planned measures, had responded to Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanying death must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, even beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude to death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts linked to each other in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, in patients deemed to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries across the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th in this regard, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to cut the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite Canadians’ majority desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
The rate is highest across the country, with 86% of hospitalized deaths in Quebec.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed its intention not to make any changes to the penal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts, who have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanying suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanying suicide of incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such violations, especially in those countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already evaded in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it allows people at the end of their lives to mitigate their sufferings.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia does not mean conveying the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
For those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or stopping the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the penal law should state that the withdrawal of funds for which a legally valid refusal has been made should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life depletion without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the remedies already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions for pain relief or life-affirming measures, the panel calls for at least to consider them, since they served as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures.
reservations of other experts
Some healthcare experts have already made reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the report signing experts as "extreme", among other things, because they set no limits on the euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is life-tired and over 18 years old asks another person to assist him in his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility over all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the report on the non-existence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Bashar al-Assad partisans demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which however, thanks to the support of Russia, opposes it and rejects a "complot" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League shutdown of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, had taken a position in favour of President Assad’s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab Prime Minister, who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his power in Syria," in which already about forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"If Bashar was concerned about his country's interest, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave,” he explained in reference to Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily tougher stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, and countries like Turkey have made an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dara region in southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "Shootings and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "controlling towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not give in,” he added, under the guise that “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers into the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from regime repressions that encapsulated him in his "Paranoia".
An extra-planned new meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the exit of the crisis, decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities, as well as the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday declared the Arab League’s decision to be “incorrect” in order to avoid any possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian prime minister, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that calls for "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, MP of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the incumbent Council President.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, waited for Mario Monti to cast a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to make sure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a list of deletions presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock and bond markets demanded their time.
In “a democracy, there are certain deadlines” to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, remarking that “it is certain that the markets will be vigilant and prudent.”
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should set up a staff consisting predominantly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians" as well.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of the parliament by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself since the inauguration of his function to work with all urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus "because a country that has no growth whatsoever that cannot respect deficit indicators".
M. Monti, known for his competence as well as his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "Challenge of Trustworthiness" as well as an "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, since Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA reported its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991 he is said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that manufactures "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that Iran's development of a nuclear explosives system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency said, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, have either declined slightly or only increased slightly over the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a global 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in very weak terms, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed.
“Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
“The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, urging that this could be done with improvements in police attitudes towards the “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" is represented in American federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King’s death to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or ancestry, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and is becoming more and more similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their posts, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow you to better read live the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being tracked and who are tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested on a small percentage of users before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esotherically-appearing wording (RT to referentially repeat another person's post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large grand un maniement plus a comparable.
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and is too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
"The Activity feature will help me track certain elements of my Flux tweeter better," said <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria
Incorporation of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The government of the major social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-bonity (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, that is, far above the criterion of 60% established by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s ability to pay were not reduced to AA+ at once, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros of interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also holding a call for the Brussels summit of the eurozone member states on 26 October: At that time, the heads of state and government would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The action taken by the Austrian government for this is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eradicate budget debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese power would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did the last time," M. Noda said.
On Tuesday, the yen again sped up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollar to lower the Japanese currency value, which is in the process of hitting a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, doped by purchases from investors who view the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, as it inflates the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as these exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region," said M. Noda, who fears that the yen's cost could kill the weak upsurge in the bud.
The third world economic power has once again gained traction with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the sudden export increases and consumption of households "plombed" by the catastrophe.
The prime minister, however, estimates that the price of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has informed the BoJ that it has already initiated "suitable measures", making it apparent that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to pay off the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates are rising, stock exchanges are pulling back
The risk of contagion in the debt crisis is constantly undermining European key figures.
Despite the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are still drifting a little further into negative areas this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions in government bond yields in the Eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and too well aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants about the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichioshi Investment Management, said in a statement.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency that continues its bait on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollers, so it declined by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, approved an application that envisages, in particular, the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, the one of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investors’ fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is on the verge of markets, as parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate shear ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
Expecting growth figures in the eurozone
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter driven by household consumption, ergo a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the base of the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an electoral meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is propelling a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, we must mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substituted source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intending to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States has decided to add another unit to its park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant that had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is oriented towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, especially on Russia, due to the increased use of import gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness as well as a stability pavement for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys found that this was a price that the vast majority of French people are not willing to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export nature, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual €6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is as little a miracle remedy as a devil’s work for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing factories, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction and indefensible human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a design that enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that equally determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had shaped the weekly shows from the official side, the interior minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a far-reaching consensus on this issue between the right and left.
From the right side, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not absorb all of the world's poverty".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided from both the right and the left in 2005.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity to which one is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his program, is limited to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron tell us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration on jobs, immigration, and immigration.
Restricting immigration would mitigate growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they mainly pursue professions in sectors that are unemployed in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not excite local wage workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where the training is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also between locals and migrants has a positive effect on wages and the national labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants leads to a co-involved, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the variety of ideas introduced by the immigrants is beneficial to economic growth (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about 1% of the total household.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; it is also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the whole 20th century from the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some may have believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy conquer its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become as good a "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change in attitude of the Greek true-fake referendum would have had a double-disclosure character in this respect: on the one hand, the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its impropriety.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from pushing for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in the wrong order and depending on the needs.
A free-kick for the European sole ruler or a jump with eyes closed into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, of full right, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, you don't know where to end the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and this is the one in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows down to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe, and it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations that are affiliated to it.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
Because it is up to the whole Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts, to free themselves from the markets and to initiate a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level, which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly leading us to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought over for a long time, today everyone is pushing European economic management to do so.
I agree.
But imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisages the citizens - would be a new folly and another dead end.
We must embark on a new stage of European development.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European People's Sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common good
The world’s smart card trade fair opens its doors Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic stance.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share was expected to increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
Consumer markets, however, are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards with contactless chips to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a very small percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
"They're in delay".
"But they should have a real upward trend at least next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
Banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday that it would prepare for the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contact by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relationship between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty" about this.
“The way in which both organizations proceed, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, indicate a clear cooperation,” he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has brought interfaces to light.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French Special Forces.
French and Nigerian investigators have reportedly found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the led telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"However, it is conceivable."
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that this is increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more noticeable in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the pulling of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start with Washington, has since then put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of Illuminati who need not be given special attention.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – meaning “Western education is a disgrace” in Haoussa – pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the commissioners.
However, Abuja’s response is, as usual, indifferent.
The army encircles the city, counting 800 dead.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations’ local headquarters became the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worrying all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem on the occasion of a talk with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed himself ready to "send all the hints".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
Over China, Iran, and Israel’s aid – often in no way underpinned – slogans fall.
The highest-ranking Mitt Romney in terms of the appointment of the “Grand Old Party” threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of “currency manipulation” – a leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
“It’s stupid if it means starting a trade war,” he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost squeezed the air as to his emotionally flattering behavior.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb".
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-ranking candidate, in turn shows a shameful file ignorance.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military strikes against Iran, for his part, is willing to hire the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 ban on resorting to torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the Michele Bachmann candidacy.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political heavyweight.
The current presidential counterparts oppose that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War in spite of all this.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as the issue of anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive negotiation with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so unconditional.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has eliminated.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more adequately surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt in order to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It will supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sounding and at gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the wheel of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on its own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any traffic through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: for them, it is now becoming more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, had not hesitated to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by advocating this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a depletion of European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the wide smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state-owned company settle at the level of their coasts in a permanent manner.
"In the event of a disaster, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be little likely, as the weld seams were estimated to have a permanence of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a naval vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures one meter in diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their forces to realize this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, who holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported is," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are prepared to recover their expenses, as Gazprom bears the liability risk alone.
The gas pipeline emerges on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal is supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent at candlelight with writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, the egg shell-colored sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinctive design notebook at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is tasked with launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton coat, which is used, for example, for upholstered bench covers.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artist until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Sales increased by 26% between 2006 and 2010, with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook delights business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is committed to asserting its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of emails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural zeitgeist and managed to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% versus 9% of the total population unemployment.
discouraging?
"No, emphasized <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high.
"However, there is still a lot of work to be done."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed people, numerous obstacles persist before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared to 38% on the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back into work, and that form the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes that are certain, yet slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneurship Association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed had “a weak level of knowledge about the disabled” that was “overrepresented” by “persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as defined in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is tasked with collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "paying" flats has decreased, as has the sum of deposited amounts between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also expresses a real realization, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of permanent establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled people, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before the Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 a.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure in the friendly game.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace well and gladly.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in club and national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought in Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "gloss".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of seven, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he said.
This inevitably helps to reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked over the road."
"To be able to play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, resounded with good-natured pride.
"The Pride to Perform a Galamatch".
"Proud" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbor" - that France "has again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he stressed.
“We’re planning something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games". The match against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams lacked professionalism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve off an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the outgoing game (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to push the matter to the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly glowing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that should be just as hot as the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being in the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz, the successor to the team.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can suffice the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal," Bento said.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are planning to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset to "give them no time to think".
A good idea, provided it is implemented this time.
