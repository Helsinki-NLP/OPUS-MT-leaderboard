Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A cemetery chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Small gardeners cultivate the former grounds of farmers.
Munich’s oldest official map reveals exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Everyone knows this, who has ever had to get upset, because the car navi indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer of the Bavarian geoportal of the state government, are far from up-to-date - but precisely for this reason very revealing.
Especially when comparing them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich’s Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project forward, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bayerische Landesbibliothek).
The comparison used/today is the most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridors from the so-called "Uraufnahme", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the Schauplatz of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of the current district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once imprisoned.
The Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there in 1858/59.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chaining of the so-called fools.
He also forbade the staff to use force against the inmates,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
There was room for 280 patients at first, and later it was extended to 500.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular debris facility in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Institution, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the madhouse, which had been destroyed in bombings during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs ripped many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a medieval chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn main line takes place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Citizens' rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in a statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies that are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that people happen to.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances earlier this year after he had no more gasoline while traveling through the state and was detained by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be ready whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranked the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws that require local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Meadow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU parliamentarians Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest Milk" is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot profit from such steep areas.
The grassland area takes care of a lot of work, much has to be worked with the motorsense.
"We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography," emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic business.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At a cost of between 3,000 and 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this would allow the reforestation of the land to be extended for quite some time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they can move their businesses forward," the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced by means of the meadow fence promotion.
The open area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71,500 euros, half were funded by Leader, and a quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job, you can't do it without farmers and farm women."
Peter White also said, “This is where the best food is produced.”
The Landscape Maintenance Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows the state to support pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be managed by tugs (hanging inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbach pasture fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence, is currently running.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House Takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually right, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There has never been a time when the "wretched waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s U.S.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract – she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exileants.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame into the overnight world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Pretty unusual, Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that’s not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy at the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's top total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir leads the way and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says she is “enormously proud” of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
“Obviously, I’m very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, for sure.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away – and, stupid and mute, we are led to battle like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing to debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the side of the governor – which is a public forum called official and of employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “foreword.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
Loudoun County’s Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents pressed for his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that downed Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stance on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are part of our nation’s foundation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next door at the Archerfield Links last year to the finals before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
“Players will see this course at its best, it’s in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It really feels special,” said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little bit more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy with how it went.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time", says the head of the construction farm Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since much is hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and shut-off grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand poll before the occupation forces.
An existing movement that rose for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated sheet metal roofs, which have been transformed into various yellow-brown shades by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt, and her bright skirt.
“We used to only have leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesia’s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains an choking presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became a genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of previous year’s atrocities, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-ma [the women] of Papua - her market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the verandah of his colourfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, to the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day 'filtered'.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” says John.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he is still living in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
“After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there'll be revenge," said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injuries quickly brought in here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by instigating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty.”
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papuans and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group’s allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokowi as a “debt” he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gun victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never receive justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which is coincidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who stated his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units were extinguishing the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (0:00 a.m. GMT) and cooling the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodations for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the system of panels for insulation and disguise at the London Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has failed with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two win sets was not sparsely supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54% of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work on improving the competition.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not been put to the vote at all.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: For example, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the plane, a survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent entering the aircraft while accidentally wearing prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to disobey the rules.
Of those surveyed, who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately taken banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many intentionally did it.
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to carry smuggled goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through safety were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the consistently triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed for the first time a different, less glamorous number when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: that of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk has frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Musk now admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders in total, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros ($1,000 in the US and <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 in the UK) "reservation payment" in full.
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that cancellations of around 12 percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth goals lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be - all models combined - 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines with maximum utilization without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-committality of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for near-surface ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone on to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround to ozone standards simply reinforce the EPO’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and agreed to set the deadline for execution," Pruitt said, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO’s statement said that Pruitt will eventually use his “delayed authority and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policies and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to address environmental polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergic document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church at Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, there was on the Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, also a royal court, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858 shows, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can now be seen in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" was the third, the royal settlement center of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The patronage right arose from early medieval self-church law.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in World War II in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumling Hilarius Cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffige Rentners" maintain the Hilarius plant as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.
On Sunday, 16 July, Tumlingen’s friends and sponsors invite you to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The head of the town, Hartmut Romann, speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink in front of the cemetery takes place.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic views.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reiterates.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier due to a change in the land use plan, the district government had not approved it due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision issued is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends itself".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not likely to result in the procedure being stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists itself".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households will be able to be met - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all Viersener households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens city council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis) around 10 a.m. on Friday morning.
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents to shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize the customers for what offers the own city has off the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the business association and the city are entering another stage of the project "Attractive city center".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the fountain festival, including sales open Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-developed or re-developed.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was a good idea to use a network to overcome the lethargy that had partly spread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was later recovered as well.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of misfortune, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, vowing to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that taking a trade for U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was “laughing”, “measuring” and “stupid” and that the existence of the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “dip” after proposing a ban on relocating refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, “That’s the most unpleasant call for all day.”
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists reinstate racist lynch act as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and romped toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long pull on his cigar and looked testing through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, played on July 22, is just a remake.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience burst out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey – were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
“It’s really incomprehensible that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested – even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the follow-up.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia State Congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the repetition serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical examiner lays a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions across the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for the blacks in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom killed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight – allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom’s wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence, and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
“It was an electoral massacre,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you get registered and if you vote, this will happen to you.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual Moore Ford Bridge Lynch remake.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through".
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors—a dozen whites and the rest blacks—pressed themselves into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and oppressing him, furious that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona reciprocates the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think that white people at the time said a --- he."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that is where the energy in the room shifts, a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning gown stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praise speech "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple travelled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s oppressive humidity for almost eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels haunted.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children crouch on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters as if he wants to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then cries in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispers.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sat down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted excitedly about the repetition with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words, what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone keeps Brooks' yard at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already begun planning the performance next year.
“The recital is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorfully frivolous production with a gigantic six-storey backdrop.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) either shows a shabby street corner with the rest of the wall and the Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
An open Mercedes oldtimer parks in front of it, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf’s leitmotif – money, power and greed – which draws through his “ring” staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a body into the trunk in Hollywood fashion and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated stormily, who is modest and bending his hands to the Merkel-Raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - again in casual casual clothing given the great heat.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he had yet to pass a valid pipe concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "buh"-calls perished.
Festival director Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a certain way," she had said shortly before the dpa's performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
You work in several places in your volunteer year.
Anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I have also been working at school all day long.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-pronounced volunteer.
How did that happen?
Quantity: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let’s say, successfully aborted.
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, you can see how it really is on the spot, in the focal point maybe too.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably take a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was the right thing to irritate me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really went.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You always have other people in front of your head, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It’s an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are negative moments, but that’s the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cut, which General Director John Fallon announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting program a <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) cost-cutting plan to reinvigorate a business that was taken by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after it grew from 1% to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that struck Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an “improvised explosive device carried by persons.”
The statement says that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since US-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay the Obama administration’s regulation, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “2015 ozone regulations,” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of Democrats and conservation groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that inhaling air containing ozone “can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior residential complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed, Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.
Although it will still take time for the area that has so far belonged to the church community to be owned by the municipality, there is now no longer any obstacle to planning the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a communal space should not only be a meeting place for the residents of the elderly-friendly housing, but openly enter the community.
As an example, the word of the "knit café" made the round.
The decision, which was made by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a common area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal the investor that he does not want to be thrown in between his legs in this regard, the proposal provides for the determination that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding construction - and pulpit roof - which reduces the height of the trough and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps, unanimously he passes the panel.
It's not that easy with the communal space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings of her own, with which you do not get very far, but you now lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm hard on it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the contradiction.
Staiger’s request to split the decision accordingly is endorsed by three supporters.
This is the case with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes in this way: "If we make the decision this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown on road
On Wednesday in Garath, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car and seriously injured.
According to police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike coming from Hilden on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road at 12:20.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfeld drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He collided with a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to fry the game against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund, the personnel concerns of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti also has to renounce David Alaba in a duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Münchner Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five losses in the past six test games, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding, “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good in the end.”
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking in the resin from star to star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the St. Andreasberg Observatory Association.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen – since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up signs along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail train will be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of interesting information, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, although it is much further away.
It also shows in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest-located observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures at least 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision of former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude.”
"I'm a former featherweight," recalled Garcia.
"I've climbed for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
The fans demand that.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to arrange a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has an interest in fighting against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later openly expressing himself to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks Riverside's three-fight champion "looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the battle that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre pitcher
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the junction Marktbreit after a tyre pitcher.
The car hurled to the right into the creek, where it crossed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates – two adults and two children – were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the emergency service, the A7 was closed for about an hour towards the north, then traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 opening of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and the result was also that the two goals would not have been in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“Two goals were too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue,” says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain will also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future, no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the triple chain, even after the experience in preparation, than with the quadruple chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players who can build well in the three-way chain at half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"It's a prerequisite, but that we harmonize even better and we don't make as many playing mistakes in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a tie, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a proper start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know anything about it.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a severe weather.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that Aue players might even be a little fresher, as they didn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortune against an ascent favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the inner defender of Fortune.
Although the guests from the Rhineland are going to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue as an easy favorite on Sunday.
"That we sweep them away just because we claim to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset,” Fortuna’s head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Released
Recent results from tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of people tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rattsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They are intended to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age."
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case it’s about 10 percent.”
Fully in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a concrete section weighing seven tons was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the government bureau in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that require renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
What is special about this is that they are prefabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizzo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach has required a special sense of touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed about the project by handwritten papers in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a single lane through a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach's local entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to get under one roof.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that on this day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the "big campaign kick-off" according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but want to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colourful picture that presents itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of Forums One World and one of the leading organizers, really enjoys: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "Urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which the AfD could also eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried for such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a rejection there, because because of the already built Laurentius church there were not enough parking spaces available.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event at the Rondell forecourt, he says: "That's the good right of the people, the main thing, it stays peaceful".
It also does: Around 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment at the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is a clearing shortly after 9 pm.
The police can cancel - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German training with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
So Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz-echo prize-winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core element of the program was only premiered in Freiburg this spring with huge success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” said Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I’ve always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
It has never confounded or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered particularly from this, but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was going to look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'"
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday evening saying, "The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The world’s athletics chief, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated in the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the banning of his country from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for “all athletes who were snatched away gold and silver medals at competitions.”
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized to itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-enter Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Violence for soldiers who have crashed in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, North Hesse, about 1000 people of the two soldiers who had died in a helicopter crash in Mali have thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
She described the two killed pilots as "the masters of their craft".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse died a week ago in West African Mali on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transported to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grief guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Secretary of Defense von der Leyen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in the operation.
The chief of staff had built up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: the operation is dangerous.
But it is also of high importance “for a country from which we are only separated by two states,” she said.
After the funeral ceremony, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information on this.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of not being happy with his title.
After the ascension of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also took the title "Prince's Spouse".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, the spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he’s worked for in the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife was always flowing with the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult position in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation for being the brand of socio-critical intellectuals in this country, I couldn’t hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, we voted for the dissolution of Parliament.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MP from their parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them.
With this, the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new parliament will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it indispensable that the Landtag decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be tested in a legally clean manner," said Thümler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's move "but something curious".
The politician himself stressed, "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she has received via the green state list, with immediate effect," said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner, the country's presidents.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision".
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters, but also treason to red-green," the Federal Head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twesten costs the Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
"In her hurt vanity and in her frustration, she puts her personal interests before the good of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil said in a statement.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and is trying to capitalize on it politically".
Lower Saxony’s CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
Thomas Oppermann, the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states submit the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really taken on by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became aware of the concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Traders, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe for health.
If eggs have exceeded the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the farms' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production plants are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to face economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it just lacking in personnel or also in conclusive competence?
It was just the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100% excluded.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent clarification of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may be present, are of crucial importance.
I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
If an unlicensed insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the armored means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
There will still be some consequences for UEFA’s Paris Saint-Germain, as the senior organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding by Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but have to counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the clubs’ debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – was to become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“FFP certainly isn’t dead, and we’re going to definitely reinforce the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer amount for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies connected to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year are still to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to end: the airline is resubscribing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the sda news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Approximately 17 million small red-and-white packed chocolate boards of 14 grams per year are distributed to passengers by flight attendants before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to reveal.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey aims to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate plates on board its flights.
Before the Swiss entered into a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class fresh passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short circuit, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discuss Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge era (when the thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Rudler, and things went to MTV.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting pot principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-bad plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now backed by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon’s lower lip beard from “Singles”, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gangs how to attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a lesser length, could deliver his agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything food for a prank.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
Fighting Drug Mafia in the Country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office told Konstanz on Friday.
15 people aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in a simultaneous raid in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the prosecutor’s office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and Kripo Rottweil’s investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused on Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be on the account of the gang.
Widely complains of large gaps in the foreigners register
"Data from citizens who shouldn't show up there": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to partly serious wrong decisions in asylum proceedings.
The Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has pointed out large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners, according to a media report.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warns Weise in an analysis, which the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" is available.
According to data, the register includes ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register."
"Failed data input can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people subject to emigration include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country.
However, such misallocations “lead to a distorted debate about how to deal with people who are forced to leave the country,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy when they have travelled from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been conducting such procedures "on families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU Member State is responsible for refugees, which they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
The office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the left-wing parliamentary group in the German Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children threaten to accept conditions contrary to human rights and endanger the welfare of children due to the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, with his now 100 donations, shared 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the local council, the community recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even involuntarily," Mayor Karlheinz Kistner emphasized.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is decomposed into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
“This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRK circuit readiness director.
Apparently, the move to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many are accounted for by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleih, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter yielded ten times every 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be needed over the next few years to curb inflation fueled by Brexit, and she said that credit costs may need to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks starting next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system — with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion sterling.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on household real income continues to put a strain on consumption."
Regarding interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "somewhat larger" scale than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would take place “gradually” and “limitedly”.
The Bank’s downwardly adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped 0.5% to $1.31 and dropped 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate increase and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” the decline in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will “recover significantly” at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will continue to attract it in the coming months.
The bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2% was “whole” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are loudly looking for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeals confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite claiming that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a “important new intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Among those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, “This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in tackling one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Living the big life: mezzanine floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the premise.
"The steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about installing the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other – with a lot of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so when you push up the door, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will be selling the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers Fight for $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers find themselves in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul had wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes city-centre offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court file states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions suggested by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business, which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million on leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.
Colin has been very restrained even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in court.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
This hope seemed to be over on Friday.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in hopes of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the White House's new chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: bad information that fell into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow—whether on paper or in briefings—because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be convinced," former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise.”
Okay. (LAUGHS)
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit has ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others – that without their interventions, Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, made up of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that could potentially promote their views of the world.
Politico - who is very concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of “being the source behind a heap of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary-General Rob Porter “tryed to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did this work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after serious criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have compiled 21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaire series'
Some of the most affluent homeowners in the West Midlands are once again on war foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a community-drawn ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the Solihull council, who said it was “useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.”
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police, taking the necessary legal action to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we will present our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on March 1st next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatically increasing number of refugees who arrived in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.
But above all Freudenstadt’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Facilities include a swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be broad, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
“We’re on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of the investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
U.S. Special Investigator Sets Up Grand Jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury, according to a report.
The board has started work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has long accused the Kremlin of engaging in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller is also increasingly scrutinizing Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that special prosecutor Trump personally took to the center and investigated the allegation of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The committee can also be called in by the public prosecutor’s office to invite persons to be interrogated under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued revolving around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be called in at the end to decide on the raising of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russian history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.”
Ty Cobb, his special counsel, said he knew nothing about setting up a grand jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the Special Counsel’s work in a “fair” manner.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president will not be investigated.
There was no reason to believe that something had changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outrage, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
In June, Comey told a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and its employees.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump would fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President’s urging of the Department of Justice.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills that could no longer easily dismiss the Special Counsel.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floats in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of nearly seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the shelf ice.
The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven announced this on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and measuring 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
To what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this shelf ice, the balance of growth and demolition was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice broke down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently does.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not raise sea level because it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of shelf ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
“Although it is a natural event and we are unaware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more endangered position,” said Martin O’Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Scientists are controversial about whether Larsen C ice cream will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice sheets of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants to pay house tariffs on staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU demands to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Shortly before the summer break, the district council held 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching positions in the circle are apparently very much sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions at the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
Together with the FDP and the UWG, the CDU now wants to take the initiative and counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented way.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for transverse beginners and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
Time to act so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU faction, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the cover of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to be reviewed that make it possible to leave the local employers’ association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-member cities," said Völker.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than the tariffs for the public service actually provides.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Last but not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescue' because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only judge any allegations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take inflatable migrants on board, who will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of waiving the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring “substantial changes or impediments” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the bailouts had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Ascents and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint lined up at viewpoint, linked by "flowing" trials and moderate ascents.
In the last two days, many meters of altitude were expected.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and lodges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the outdoor inhaler.
Neustadt was also under attack.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had gotten to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - both athletic and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
In the future, are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through in the wind and weather to fight over the stadium grass?
The fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gains.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this field.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says Executive Board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a number of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation is organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14- to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be online far more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are contested at the competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which the pros compete against each other.
And at the Asia Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is this a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sports.
The scientist positively highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sports.
Players are travelling internationally, this is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were converted in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.
However, e-sports “is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” Deloitte advisers write.
Many countries are already further international.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and in France, the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clarifying the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
“You can’t hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the same as it always was.”
Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poison-laden eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars, and five years have been suspended on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said Thursday at the hearing, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward-facing eyes when she was convicted.
“Your actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that “their age or maturity, or even their mental illness, have a significant impact on their actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, stating that "there is no day where I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity."
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "followed" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having that only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself up, jump out of a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new mini-lamb
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he stopped the bandage assigned to him.
"The coach did not announce it," the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the start could have run better than in the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich as such.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of vacation, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those who you trust a lot that you want to keep in your mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the legacy of lame can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich said: “That’s what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flicked over the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did the rest.
In this starting formation, Kimmich seemed to be the one who could best take the rudder in his hands.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had an eye for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (nearly worked); Renato Sanches with getting on with the achievements of the Asia trip (also worked out only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not being negatively noticeable in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, in addition, Süle tried himself a few times successfully in the set-up of the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not the way we hoped it would be."
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said good-bye to his new players after a few crisp statements in the back.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new ones anymore.
Alaba motivates women of the ÖFB
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported himself via Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB-Damen all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is almost like a clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladies.
The tweet of Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissings tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V request - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau on the motorway 1 is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
Even this year, the Ministry hopes for a plan-fixing procedure, by 2021 the construction law should stand.
The western bypass of Trier also plays a role in the country’s plans, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Road Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims to use a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been subsiding for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the Chamber of Commerce praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the master’s examination and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of master’s training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers who Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned mobility company, only 29 jobs have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, Vice-President of the CDU Group, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than is proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a rating of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant internet connections and demolitions.
Former economics minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust emissions emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of scolding the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but returned under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been charged, while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message was sent to the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft drives through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbageberg.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
The motto "True love is..." is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughter against suffering
At times Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters are his hallmark.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he found himself, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found a lot of fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures roam in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his drowsy figures continue to find much spread around the world.
For six years he has also worked on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as an adversary.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which will be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird to me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Provence Lavender Threatened by Climate Change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and insects transmitting diseases, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämers, guilds, traders, vagants or a landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials, and ceaseless drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column – no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings have been initiated.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little use for discussing security, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we are all suspicious.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 in holdings.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that is yours as a journalist - either that or you're playing the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why haven't you told me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days before, it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the 104-degree (40°C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half joked, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite location of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have regarded Valdez’s column as the most informed source of the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been turned into a repository for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because employees have become something they never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, government officials involved, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to her disconnected head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb edge, they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cries up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they would not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the Riodoce staff followed in his footsteps.
“How can you even think of closing,” Bojorquez said, “if the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the streets for reporting.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner’s incredible rhinoceros have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown — and they said she had something of an “uneasy past.”
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as the back shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of dandruff and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shading—think deer, zebras, or belt animals—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behaviors on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been in the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its conserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you only peel a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The chalk era was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot-long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long laces protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was floating through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carmbo.
There are numerous injured, mile-long traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car crash late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were forced together during a thunderstorm.
At first, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
They are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesperson said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometers was formed.
According to an AZ reporter, there were also massive handicaps on the opposite side of the road - due to numerous gaps.
The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who are now facing sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident happened on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: knowing nothing, you’re sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are deeply immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the conductor and wakes up an insanity or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing unaffected ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, let's expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a rail spokesperson.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without a conductor.
To be able to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do.
You also have to use the app of the train, which DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
The "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluation.
The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control station Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, work on, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed by our train attendants without ticket control, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time on the train,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than they have today to respond to individual customer needs."
Anyone who often travels by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest problems.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents that you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking your own ticket and the conductor in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born woman sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
“Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” it said.
Confused as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police gang and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign saying, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman disarmed his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the type of murder that we have become accustomed to and that we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black state.”
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a bad job of keeping her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson’s possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It all came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly reveal personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story reiterates the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and that's why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being held up by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to her identity.
“She was the person who stirred that energy,” she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Dream" to "Größenwahn": TV readers discuss bit-gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the subject.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Do not need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the Bauernmarkthalle is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
However, this is not likely to be very low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, retail stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
It is a pity that there are almost no more specialty shops and what is left of them will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit in with me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
First and foremost: Where should the farmer’s market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery already manage to dispose of all the shops from Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer’s market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no room for a farmer's market hall anymore.
If the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York, there are many faces – white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly similar – hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek dolls and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she made secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Matching Similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal correspondents who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book “Suppressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the President would transform Chelsea’s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to further flare up the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which have been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s advanced scientific dictionary) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, they won," he said.
"So never shut your mouth."
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacras, which assemble like hordes of protesters.
That was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5"2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on vacation and has been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal case being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)’s remaining criteria for restoring Russia’s anti-doping agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko’s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by WADA.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the groups of companies.
It was a purely precautionary measure, it could not be further assumed of any health impairment, it said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been demonstrably tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lause agent.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The Start-ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees’ luck at their e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees are feeling.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and directly contact the Board of Directors.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where’s Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can re-drill why.
Companies are coming to see that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could hold more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to financial services website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of the Uber case in discredit earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The public opinion court has caught the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “social media to come to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glittern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees engage and are engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and dedication, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if a company’s administrators do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, 'Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And whom you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of employees in an industry known for high revenues.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It closes at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load on players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during the summer school during Moras' six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August 20 before the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they continue to tickle, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come by Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear visual lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been tossed with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a gatepost.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then getting ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible fake messages and send them to fact-checkers who may display results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful posts like before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy home in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarish Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were also there.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overvalued my welcome greeting a little bit"), all of this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go its course!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There's a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Are the two of them connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise interns."
After finishing his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with that damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf concealed
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (a tour of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
“Too good for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a standalone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point".
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can taste its new umbrella brand and the campaign for an average five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
This week as well.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
The civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army – mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the culprit of the coup attempt.
A total of 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been under negotiation in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempted overthrow as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really control the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Unease at Military Headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7,395 public servants to be fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real lords of the country.
Three times they put on their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the European Union’s reform targets.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately advancing an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the clean-ups.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington to Change the Rules of the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way green cards are issued to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, there has been constant debate about the future of the Rennsteigshuttle - now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction will take place on the marred route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is scheduled to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and refurbishment of the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," said Transportation State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This negotiates the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by a sufficient number of people to order it again regularly in the future.
In addition, the route is in part highly sloping.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’re going to see them much more often,” Mr. Sharkey said on the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” said True Companion’s website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (called here: reluctant) Farrah, worry you the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the margins of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to put it in the way of speech of 2017: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a binary wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s electoral relatives.
We're all supposedly trying to crack our filter bubbles.
Less has been noted is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kin she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite oddly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his kittens will one day no longer repel us.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness when compared to its standards.
I find myself infested with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the crazy guy today – the dog on the car roof, which is 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which, in fact, appear to be a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, the largest of the New York Park department’s carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous in size, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look fearfully over their own shoulders - extremely sinister and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés disappoint a city: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count – but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my “experience” with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning while I was tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius’ six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released on holiday and in secondary schools.
Three of the lay-off students will go to high school in the future, four to high school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm, but then is released into freedom.
In addition, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was crushed, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the induction of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goblins who wore cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young are different from the other young (chickens), but belong to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he would feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps in with teaching shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chick season is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it has been a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time sounded.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first-graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, cited by television.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sithonia by the police.
The same day they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected Persons Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust performance of cars of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempted from this.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The obligatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have scam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to every person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within their scope.
How long will the overall conversions last?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don’t drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would follow suit, says Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive price drop for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But especially in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there are no losses in value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured this year.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told The New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s urban builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised, but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still very much fun for him, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, while respecting the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
Because this function the city wants to keep anyway.
If they could no longer fill it in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects will be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has begun.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium refurbishment is still the subject.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
Designed for a city builder, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre.
Haslach’s own construction farm and nursery can be flexibly reacted to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town is under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears great responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything here is running over my table."
He can count on long-term employees when it comes to supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay".
Because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should be able to demonstrate a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building regulations and construction planning law.
The City Building Office is responsible for civil engineering, civil engineering, building planning, land acquisition, administration of the municipal properties, municipal farm with construction farm and municipal gardening, as well as the Lower Construction Law Authority including the protection of monuments.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South railway line blocked
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad junction in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a lute strike," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delayed minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic, rail customers could also be subjected to penalties on the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum was expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without any hindrances.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the U.S. and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that protein’s essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signature began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holders’ role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner into the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and pulled over the US in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Only no fire from the party headquarters, only no headwind from the Confederation - this was the most important wish of the electoral campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-controlled state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even have been described in the approach with headwind.
It was deep hits.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the apostate Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return their mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," sighs an SPD electoral campaigner, as the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is there after the transition of the green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU without a government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It became so - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumble, and the Düsseldorf plea smoothly killed the party.
The comrades rallied again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next downpour.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards, which can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And then there is Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been criticized for a long time.
My survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks.
The endeavour of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted, as they promised themselves by Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because, in fact, is not to blame for the party-internal strife of the Lower Saxony Greens.
Not Schulz at all.
In the meantime, the comrades therefore strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy, as Mrs. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The electoral will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for village centre III
If you want to renovate your house that has come into the years, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
There have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations to date are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to also promote internal development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4, the government bureau of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the “really old” houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in rehabilitation in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Soziale Stadt", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot.
Finally, the rehabilitation area would be defined as a statute.
From 1 January 2017, the grant period will run until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the survey would be carried out, in which a questionnaire to be filled out will be given to the parties involved in the rehabilitation area.
In November or December, as far as possible, the statutes will be adopted, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban development maladministration and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.
A remediation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals with, among other things, the structural condition and the rehabilitation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information can be given about the size, distribution and residents of a living space.
The blue "business arc" is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "winddog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can’t “reserve” funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasteful" for the attendees.
British inventor sets a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military reports left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the heart of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. around 7 a.m. on July 17, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of hours of service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the show 'Made In America' - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to drop the U.S. president in the White House at precise centimetre rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted on the flight crew’s training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said taxpayers took the burden on none of the other props presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"Defining the costs for taxpayers based on the estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight that.”
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firefighter car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss ahead of tricky task
The leader of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga competes in the third round of the table Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third-placed TC Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite having a flawless record after five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I think the team is very good."
For class and stability in the Suchsdorfer SV, especially the imports from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to assignments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It’s going to be hard for us as usual.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His blue-white debut could be made by Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays in the tournament in the Czech Republic comes to his first appearance this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed under the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress has packaged in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming at the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors of the local OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2, have been alarmed since then.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the company could ward off and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving their first trailer and showing the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the day-care lunch itself again.
With permanent contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city’s daycare centres, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban daycare facilities (Kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2,800 children each sat at the tables, and the demand is steadily growing.
"In the meantime, not only children who are being cared for for 45 hours per week are eating lunch in the daycare center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
From 1 September, 46 part-time staff will have kitchen service: they will heat the food delivered, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, hand out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a day care center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the length of the hour.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the day-care team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts".
That’s also what it’s all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the kids.
"They have a known power in the daycare, a person they are familiar with, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms - hitherto also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm, which it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-direction and external allocation for the city, according to the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being newly hired.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial elections and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men called the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, about 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, which failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with managers of biscuit manufacturer McVitie on the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would “be the first to experience” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is profoundly affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “The store manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and should our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn about this.”
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga site may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not slow down in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record robbery three years ago?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million last season.
After terminating, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strong warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players signed with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage of over 200 euros to the vehicle’s disguise.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to meet him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was traveling with his VW around 7.55 pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so that he had to evade to the right.
In doing so, the Touran driver touched the guardrail.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau at tel. 05761/92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann meant.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen provides further discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then misjudgment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper “Osservatore Romano”, on the other hand, criticized that in reporting violence at the cathedral spats are measured by “double measures”.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, “beats were a very normal educational means of coping with naughty children like me.”
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, according to author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the book "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is contained in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who is responsible for the education of the diocese of Regensburg?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Domspatzen from Regensburg were "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report states about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be noted that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral spats relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidences of violence against protected persons at the Regensburg cathedral spats" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who often became palpable when a cathedral spat did not bring a top performance.
How do you, as a biographer, assess this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you bother and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of not being too late to learn about it or of not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, exhibits a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only popped with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread flaps and pulled all too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his honorary rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as among teachers.
Do you know any such discipline methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, this is, of course, bagatellism.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets have just rushed at him.
Many who have never understood him still work hard on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg cathedral spats.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one affected person, representing the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with sexual abuse education was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional sense.
How do the domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger’s role in relation to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that from all of him... boys have become more pervasive or clearer or more open-minded than to their parents, boarding directors, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students affected in advance entrust themselves to him and/or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any circumstance.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or brought to justice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "violence excesses" was read by the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Waiting away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
This is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses, and, let’s say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible pedagogy of beatings, the cases in which boys were bullied and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But the master of the cathedral chapel, Georg Ratzinger, had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the cathedral spatzengymnasium.
On it, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him".
At the most, there is the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing about what happened at a school where he was not working and was responsible (as the witness said), and then only around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger consistently closed his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to him that "the punishment for beatings continues to be practiced in preschool."
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long since banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
You can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was at all times abominable and also not to what was committed in pre-school to atrocities and violence against innocent children’s souls, that goes far beyond what was then customary.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e., puffing and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of beatings also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, because the cathedral spats played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said that without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world class from the previously nationally known Regensburg cathedral spats, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candies alone, you don’t make rebellious boys great singers and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him over and over again as a wonderful, humorous, ground-benevolent, deeply believing and heart-felt person, who you can’t imagine hurting even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral spats still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who have not forgiven him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral spats today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving person of respect, to whom they still look up today and who worship them.
And please, once again, very clearly: all that he is accused of is methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would require a 93-year-old man, who has gained great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburg cathedral spats, to finally leave in peace.
