Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the inflation rate was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. In its discretion, the interest rate cut would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment to the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the midst of a twilight: inflation must be “agreed” in order to rule out the need for action later on.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached a twelve-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The reason for the rise in inflation in the eurozone is the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
In 2007, there was also a significant increase in the price of cooking oil and dairy products.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup instigates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference among the party-faithful voters is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry hurdle: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth expects an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents – a historic high – rated the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great trust or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n accounts for 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that they can cope with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
If, after the unrest in October last year, 35% had voted for the remainder of the government and the head of government, that share today amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would “participate with certainty” and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty" and another 15 percent would consider their participation "probable", given these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital daily allowance.
Turning to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the proportion of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Alsoan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Napi Christmas basket has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over HUF 1,000 have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets were “galloped up” last December, the price did not drop drastically compared to the already high, previous starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid well under 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets studied.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year’s level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but in Auchan there were 1kg of bread woken for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price drop to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan scored the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" basket compared to last year's Christmas prices have increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and this year’s most expensive one was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and current year’s most expensive one was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices for last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected the trade: it seems that the department stores were not able to decide exactly which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, it can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to measurable taxes, the price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forint more than last year, and even the cheapest one, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was seen, the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a cost of more than 30 percent over the period of 12 months.
So, in addition to flour, also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, as the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets are not complaining; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable foods go in pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is reporting a lower customer frequency, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that do not exactly contribute to the containment of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
The traumatology department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital has recently been diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By December 10 this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of the people in its nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are overdosed or improperly used, the well-reacting bacteria produce antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for curbing the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, hospitals should examine the patients enrolled and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not practiced so frequently in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no grants from the state health insurance company for this investigation.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always observed by hospitals.
Among the outpatient or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saved by disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by nursing staff.
It is precisely for this reason that hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds are tightly lined, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the financially less well-positioned hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that actually favor the development of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting to grips with MRSA infections causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, so they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment was recorded in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data shows, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death row police officer was not drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII. district, the official report is now available.
The now-resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest prosecutor’s office on Friday after the official opinion on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat at the wheel.
The former police chief took his own car in the XXII district into Kossuth Lajos Street and crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street on the zebra strip, priority.)
The pedestrian died after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The 100 million loan agreement has already been signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the 200 million loans.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with an 8-year deferral, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is attentive to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the EU’s still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country sooner or later attracts investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russia has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers’ paradises, attracting tourists in both the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already purchasing on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also seek to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down, either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication options are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is made up of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent annually.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percentages
As Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question of the conference is whether the developed countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on aid to developing countries has also been reached.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be implemented at the UN’s Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as can be read in the “Piac és Profit”.
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s commitment to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by the 1990 levels) regardless of whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be successfully achieved, and that the Union would even be prepared to commit to a 30 percent reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their obligations to their fullest and responsibly.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU with its then 15 member states had already committed itself to a reduction of 8%.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will certainly meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system whose importance has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee which has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and increasing the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban on the net since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The images made with miniature cameras attached to helmets are monitored at the Air Force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Department of Defense was registered under "defence headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of foreign operations.
Such published propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television advertisements, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise with Game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots, also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos shot during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gender" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogate in the ministries
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is by no means squeaky: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogate.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas atmosphere with tombola or impulses into the civil servants’ hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas party of a ministry will be held in the Defense Department this year, but the Ministry’s employees are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the festivities.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
While the focus of the festivities is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday in the House of the National Judicial Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Approximately 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was stated: There was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government each prepare for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to the conference at the end of the year.
It is expected that around 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only greeted with coffee and pogatee, the celebration will end with 350,000 forint.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply be in the hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, where 436 employees are expected to attend.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forint per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent impulses.
Since the beginning of the term of office of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will be no proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on 20 January, this time the Ministry’s Christmas party is cancelled.
One hundred guests are asked to visit Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("V<0xC3><0xA1>rosliget"); according to the department, the expenses are 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief address by the minister and sound with restraint.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest meeting is held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work stoppage begins.
It is expected to face strike-related, significant traffic restrictions, as rail traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large-scale protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards all organizations that have joined the strike will lay down work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will be possible to vote on the health insurance law only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will result in significant traffic barriers: the railway workers lay down their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies are stationary.
At the same time, there will be many highway locks in one direction.
The call for a strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is updated on the league website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations have announced strikes indefinitely, while others are planning a temporary lay-off.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railways on sufficient services, although more and more people are traveling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV strikes from the start of operation until 1 pm, at Budapest Airport between 7 am and 9 am, the LIGA Electricity and Heat Energy Trade Unions lay down the work for four hours, and the Teachers' Union, e.g. the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for 2- and 2-8-hour strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new conception for societal discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three states that the eligible occupational groups will be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the sidelines and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "had significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organisations, called "national self-defense associations", have been founded.
“These groups have in common that they each define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for – sometimes armed – defense tasks (catastrophe protection, state defense, order guarding), citing the inability of the police, the army, or the state itself,” it said.
And furthermore, all this is done according to the method that attempts to disguise various political aspirations, based on the political and party resentment of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association, therefore, do not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration with the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," he said.
From the research institute’s point of view, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU immediately took the incidents as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization was "national protection".
In their opinion, a veritable "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained actless and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And furthermore, the initiative would have sparked a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if risk-changing trends are apparent, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rescheduling the working days around the public holidays has now become established, but next year gives us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Unemployment-free days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
We have a total of 14 holidays throughout the year.
The National Holidays are March 15, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the founding of the state, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, will ultimately be processed, has long been determined by the Minister of Labour in his own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and beneficiaries, to public servants and civil servants alike.
Excluded are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
At the end of the year, the working order is only somewhat confused by the holidays: From 24 December, life in this country remains formally standing, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time compensation, or the specially canceled holiday.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer redistributions on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work out the Friday, 24 October in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely in the focus of the holidays, after everything will lie and stand, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday work.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or do you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to point you out that someone called from the marketing department,” says one colleague.
Did you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and repentantly confessing that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the issue is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, think about what you can do to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than grabbing a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more if you urgently need it.
Talking about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what did you do?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if anyone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report sickly, citing painful headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indefinite completions, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by the colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play badly with your colleagues.
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
In other words, phone calls, phone calls
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggle of the colleagues?
Unintentionally listening to a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which are carried over their heads), kicking, constant scorn or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It’s best to acknowledge your mistakes, and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for the missing is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slippers: Comfortable for at home, but hasn't lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone wants to do it right - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene hasn’t spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage rock with its guitar quilt is back in, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in Pécs, performing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he began to walk his own way – perhaps because a inn does not tolerate two pipers.
He made the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, but he did not make it until he was asked to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and, together with Yonderboi, chose Zagar as the almost only trendsetter, also marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new avenues for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be okay, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, which corresponds to the zeitgeist and the trends, the influences of the rock'n'roll are also noticed.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - since the latest from early to late pop music mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has gradually put the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), the earworm.
So everything is fine (?).
The hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener’s readiness to listen also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a wider tradition abroad, especially in the west of us.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more are coming to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
For us, music does not come from serving a purpose, but from a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: If you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He travels as a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from the fact that you always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a pull-horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why you, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea to assemble the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls make it?
B. Zs.: The song has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this song still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the tune the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically immediately and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I remember being quite electrified at the time, but it also required the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing perfectly together and are no louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also in the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they stood in the back was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where to go, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the case of musical creative work, there were actually none at all, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts constantly and even now that I have "lost" the album.
Currently, they are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless Fraud
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It was almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it the same to his colleagues, in addition, was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He's mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who showed him to the police.
However, as Kerviel’s statements, published by the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made gains of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros, especially in the American crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he raised his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Kerviel admits, continuing to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he faked documents so that he could not be found.
He even managed to mislead his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
“I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion dollars for the bank.”
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
He knew that he would never earn as much as anyone else.
“In my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigator.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or knew about it.
“As long as I made money, I closed my eyes.”
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
How did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want him to be looked into the cards,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion.
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the next few years.
It is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to allocate around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will be spent on transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative ventures.
This will allow companies to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries to date in the current EU fund acquisition.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20-year sentence for ex-president
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (from 1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
The president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, says it will now depend on the detainees whether to let Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n sit his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court found that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had set up to finance his campaign in 2001.
The budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
It was approved for the current year with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could therefore not allow itself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no-confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-regarded, yet highly significant law in peace.
This is, in a sense, paradoxical.
Everything governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that’s why they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets in the past social democratic governments suffered from three weaknesses, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is legally compulsory, not only pensions, but also social expenditure decided by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
However, a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to gaining income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issued unintentionally debt securities, by which they owed their town halls in excess.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts by mass selling shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
This source is already dry.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been undergoing a period of growth for several years, which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts of without interruption.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to fix public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even though it has succeeded in removing some of the nonsensical populist spending passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, practically all politics in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but pure management.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments hadn’t spent what was going on in the last decade.
If we don’t really want ruling politicians to become pure administrators, then we have to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can incur in taxes and fees, and is able to want rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions, banks are auctioning interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, with another 24 making it loose for the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to mitigate or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group.
“The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen if they decided to do this,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in lending money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of lending each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts believe that this move will help central banks heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be most damaging to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN international conference on climate change in Bali, which is about to end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it's a word firework that's only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was very important to him, and that he is therefore committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties can read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but he believes he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and thus pose no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from attendees, he repeatedly stated that he was not against “a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield.”
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver’s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive anymore did not exchange their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in the firing bill exchange, the capital’s offices are flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
The issue of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not make the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver’s license, are threatened with a fine from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also have it applied with a reminder in the event of the violation.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may increase to 2,500 crowns.
According to previous information, even those who do not drive can be punished by the municipality.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose at most a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, but nobody threatens a thousand-crown penalty.
The driver's license is a document where everyone can decide whether they want to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, including a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
It suffices to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court cuts penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done something together with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "office for the fight against organized crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today’s judgment, only revision before the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also indicted on this matter, but he is initially faced with the first-instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more.
In January, a district court convicted 19 people mainly of involvement in robberies, and the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the booty.
The indictment is about crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Particularly for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for presumption of office and illicit weapons possession.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser target telescope and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the indictment, has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
With the exception of nearly 20 men in this trial, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as being legally guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet come to trial.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish detention and await the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far missed the main trial.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> 12 million kroner plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parental couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore completely disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the opinion that the other side had created.
We will see if it has any value at all.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone together," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l emphasized.
According to him, the amount should range between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert opinion drawn up for him by the university hospital in Prague, Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men were better off with the stress situation, even if they were faced with allegations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently happening, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian Moravian Height) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by them due to the error of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which underlies the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can request assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came to his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachy".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian king", but the project had built a team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas parasitic," said Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to the words "Walachian Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Raising money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to gain parasitic in our work," he continued.
lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him.
At that time, however, this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of spending Walach passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also argued today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"The popularity of Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who would have devoted themselves intensively to it.
The co-operation of the parties that are now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslav's I elected until St. Nimerleins Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>’s Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, she took the lead as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the contest for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's parade in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages are waning
To tell you the truth, I was never a fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The station wagon with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the insufficient headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast forward
I only go through the interior briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I have objections only because of the pitiful middle tunnel.
I would like to welcome a little more designer design, where the car would otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may have complained about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
With regard to the space available, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo space.
I have to call it (also because of the folding rear window) very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 litres in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is left behind by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a vacation abroad or when loading a stroller.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s what a 1600 cubic motor should look like, which drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
When I compare him to his counterpart at <0xC5><0xA0>koda, who sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still rising.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is already quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the test car beats once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric rear window lifters and...
For example, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll arrive at a very similar amount.
So all that remains is the decision which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and bullying among students have spread to the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a 10-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy climbed on a busheye and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then uncovered his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you choose just the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palms and all-inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and captivating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in an abundant amount.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (especially during Prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, and cars drove across the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht laid.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the fifties still drive around Havana to this day, because the once imported shigulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have fallen down sharply, nowhere in the vicinity you will find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are currently being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marmot that is unique in the world and attracts railway enthusiasts.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-driven narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are already elsewhere in the museum.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It is worth mentioning that there is a museum in Hemingway’s already mentioned estate, whose visit should not be missed by the person who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soils accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the fifties of the last century there was no road there that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factory".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revitalizes after darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is barely touched by human intervention.
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage List thanks to its pristine nature.
There, the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in fact it originated about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the Sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, could be written on many pages about all this.
But, as they say, it is better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to their ideas, as the representatives of the countries that stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"Afghanistan is a sign of progress, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start a further development of the economy and security themselves," British defense minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop said the same thing today.
“I’m not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters agency at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
There has also been a debate among the countries involved over the past few months about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan non-study unmasked: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Public debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to be indebted this year with 159.2 billion cones.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic’s national debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech owes a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
“Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the one trillion-crown limit until 2009.
Next year, debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion kroner," said David Marek, analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, said: “To exceed one trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we don’t know yet.
If it were to show that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t expect such a change,” he remarked.
Debt is Growing
The national debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The government’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
“Over the year, total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mainly seen in the bonds, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and handling of public debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
The consolidation agency has a maximum amount of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion, and instalments for bonds with the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher working at the Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a sign bearing this name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows her well, and she would never have done anything to make her too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many of the teacher’s students share, describing it as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence for the Prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% inhabited by Albanian speakers, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
Baden’s talks, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had received the UN’s mandate for a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation contract to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo’s independence to the Security Council, insist on a continuation of negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia has been and will continue to advocate a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under the supervision of the EU to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to proclaim them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations were held of last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that Belgrade’s proposed plan for autonomy is part of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, warning the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly proving a “Domino effect” in a region so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, that does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be made solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
Kosovo's parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that Kosovo’s parliament will have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence will take place on the part of the Albanian-speaking population in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation encompasses the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians are mainly centered around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the current state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all issues, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor for his part, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli coexisting, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car on Rue Louise-Michel drove towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no mission, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a police spokesman.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without registration, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two youths without a helmet, hit at a very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its advance from the right, a police officer further explained.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is much negative.
The condition of the car (bottomed fender, split windshield, torn bumper) is evidence of the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main public security department of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded investigation of the IGPN at this stage the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small motorcycle has come to its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been hooked together until the policemen managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be the subject of a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were induced yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel there was a rumor that the policemen had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and which requires very careful action.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youngsters, the fourth telephoned.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident in the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police officers left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not let it be said that the police did not help the young people.
First aid has been provided to these young people.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police broke down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to testimonies, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the i framework of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades deployed by the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositionists, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (middle) and in Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
He had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings, the magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to give the commander-in-chief over the army and become a civilian president has not been valid since the invocation of the state of emergency, Vice Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, when his first term as president ends.
The Vice Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of women who use the pill between the ages of 20 and 40 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
For one in five couples, it is even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is soon to accommodate the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew’s second task was to implement a 17.5 tonne solar panel power generation module that was already on the ISS to put it in its final position.
After shifting it, the crew embarked on the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle, which had been attached to the station, to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old learned doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and attached some kind of rails to the damaged site.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels generating several hundred volts, had been devised and crafted by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today to fly back to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the arrears of the A400M, the EADS stock is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to re-examine its 2007 business forecasts, referring to the residues caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, more than one billion of which is for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detail.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month lag.
As a reminder, the business performance of EADS fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned an initial delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on public broadcasters to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything go through, and was satisfied with providing a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference—his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without scams, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have missed it.
It denounces an electoral campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the almighty United Russia Party, who will elect government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes back even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again adhered to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians renounce the personal responsibility they have briefly demonstrated after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) head the local ballot lists of the United Russia.
The new liberties coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think for a long time?
Those in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed on a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, commissioned with their administration, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been assembled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
More than 300 permanent employees still process tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen today.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One cannot expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, had Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India are seeking a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros annually and services worth 10 billion euros, had declared this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, and regretted that the European Union's reciprocal trade has not yet reached its full potential in New Delhi.

The Bank of England takes note of the worry and offers <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
To mitigate the fears that conditions on the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on December 6, in the form of an open-market operation, which it announces for five weeks.
The Bank further explains that in this way, at 12.15 GMT on 6 December, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be circulated, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the day-to-day different interest rates of interbank loans at its base rate.
The day-to-day difference in interbank interest rates on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has fluctuated to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis this summer, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that have prevented banks from claiming them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s purchasing power proposals
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Bill on Purchasing Power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text, drawn up in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), indicated about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, most of them 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flotante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partly violent word-changing between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances that had been reviewed by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors surrounding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which now accommodates up to 177,500 people.
C3’s Charlie Jones, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been to, says that his company and Melvin Benn’s work side by side in parallel to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
We have selected Philadelphia as the market and are working hard with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents revived the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival at the Grand Park Chicago, after it made its mark in the world of festivals together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events achieved $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues respectively.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s recording capacity is “very large,” roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” Jones said.
His partners at C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator opposes it.
These lure attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "heikel mandate" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the cinema there is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing an end-year rally? Expert Disagreements Due to the US Mortgage Crisis
With just under five weeks until the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make safe predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is usually accompanied by a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is strongly affected by the trend towards high-value assets.
According to these experts, the stock market will tend to show a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the potential decline in the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude price and the risk of the increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on November 8th of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional pension fund subsidy made every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that things could change slightly this year, especially as a result of the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the bridge day to the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near-technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these are positive.
When it comes to selecting the values to push the ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney asserts that this year’s big values are the turn of the year.
Among the value-winners, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine the market events in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, December has only seen a decline in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% increase in price.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and can also have a final year rally will show.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economical regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The Bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement that closes 75% of all branches on Saturdays and opens on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular pursues with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those stores, which, due to their location, can capture the buy-in customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the stores, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
Bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would be accompanied by increased staffing, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a roads have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
These PopularMax stores do not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have reached a provisional agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time, surpassing its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
The CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction with this sentence at the close of the stock market, which he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deep.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous year’s losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, at Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) to 2,518.53 million and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question remains, to what extent we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television channel to receive more than 1,000 million gross revenues from advertising revenues this year, as assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the station would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business was only 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see the main factor for Telecinco’s improved market performance in terms of the high payout ratio that the company has had to date: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a caused a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio may still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far stated significantly more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has some loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced Antena 3’s forecast profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) holds a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (holding) due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: Recommends to reset expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which today ended its meeting with the congressional decision in the Senate on the supplementary/amending amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate MPs, who had in their negotiations and voting the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised companies and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies that are affiliated with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to regulated markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the internationalization of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focal points of their company profile, confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market, and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Economic Commission of Congress provided for further changes in retrospect, with the decision that the titled bond now has to be considered complex financial means for the investor due to its high degree of risk, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the directive was used to legally limit the areas of work of graduate economists; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricting the areas of work reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a third-party account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can simultaneously offer its services for commercialization of products and customer acquisition to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the prematurely determined indicator should only serve as a guideline and therefore not be in line with the final result announced on December 14.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to deputy head of government and economic and finance minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in CPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time reassuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that even if the current figure is not good, the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economics and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over €42 billion over the next three years
Northern Rock’s holdings have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were record-breaking <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that fell significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of customers’ trust, and despite the government’s one-hundred-percent guarantee that the money will be safe, it will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue to run the group under the Virgin Money brand name, will have to earn about a quarter of the revenue of the British banks that will be made up of the investments there over the next three years to acquire exactly the <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion that is still needed to achieve its 30 billion target.
The group of multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to send <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (equivalent to approximately €70 million) annually to advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The Mayor of Totana Arrested for Suspected Participation in Urban Corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo last May represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and at the time chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and could, according to information from the Cadena SER broadcaster, be the original coordinator of the conspiracy.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, deputy Juan Morales was arrested upon leaving his client's residence due to important incriminating documents to be associated with the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged order payments Morales made to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory by the Socialists, assume the office of President of Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE’s organizational secretary, and Bono announced this at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party’s headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from the Mancha would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would no longer run for the next general election, end his career in public policy, and instead campaign for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the prime minister had been continuously pushing for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of Vice-President for Economics, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of Congress president in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or strife, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you get the impression that the only place where you can’t talk quietly in Madrid is Congress; for example, the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work, suggesting that he did not seem to have already taken office, as otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to merciless criticism of both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a state of emergency regarding the action or non-action of his government, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the forefront of those countries within the EU that have least met the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for failing to meet the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures he has envisaged against climate change without hesitation.
Which companies will be affected by it, which behaviour of citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and which economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice and pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real life are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous in terms of electoral strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-based town of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office, and a hotel operator were also detained for suspecting urban construction violations.
The city council was detained at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises it is located until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal building management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the investigations that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban development projects were to be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration illegally commissioned it during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were brought to the judge today.
Investigation circles are also investigating former Totana mayor and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo-based lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is said to have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are conducted by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil Central Unit, whose representatives carried out eleven other searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which would include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of area to be rebuilt in Totana, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would raise the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the term Book of the Month and instead try to invent a price designation of another name with appropriate competencies.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are welcome to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; coincidentally on the day whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is an alumni who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chair of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical stance on Plato and proposed that Plato’s teaching be removed from the undergraduate curricula for the subject of philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be subject to six months in prison.
However, if you again rob a music store under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than if you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange entails a six-month jail sentence of up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has quite screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were right with their response and therefore also received the same content; but if one of them received twice as much, it also resulted in stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it actually takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan Wars for eight years and is located in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on free foot.
Their names are on the list, which the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track the escaped criminals and to pressure the respective governments to find their nets.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which again depends on various factors, e.g., age, gender, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policyholder.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to present the corresponding compensation amount in the event of damages.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that is composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit that is given to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points to consider when choosing an insurance policy in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing an inexpensive insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out a full insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance with deductible, so that the benefits of a full insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, principal representative of Spain at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs; this will increase your credit by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it may allow itself to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, due to the fact that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most sensible to opt for a full insurance with a deductible.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out a full insurance policy; of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question permits.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with a deductible (at an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only starts for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full insurance with a deductible (at an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance that only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the final in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the final of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th for entry into the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of everyone else and the draw at Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the ever-expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtik Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the 16th final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could be a defeat even in a kick of FC Shakhtar to qualify, but he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points tie the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win in the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to avoid the Scots the evening. They again hope to reach the 16th final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row after being defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-game time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the first game.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the 16th-final and joining UEFA depend on his victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band disbanded in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people watched the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the band’s history, which had caused a stir at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and world tour intersect with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has never seen our wardrobe, and so I am already curious what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later led to the dissolution of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings had changed to the Spice Girls.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad I made this decision, Chisholm commented on the breakup of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also reported that the disputes had been resolved and that everyone was now very fond of each other.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the Spice Girls’ last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, according to the report of the television channel CTV, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was welcomed by an army of nannys.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia’s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut deliveries to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the checks of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service does not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal record records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should pick up guidelines on the criminal record extract that helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment investigative guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests work well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the boards had problems identifying those employees who were on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures were predominantly adhered to by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on the pre-employment control investigations by all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Ceremony
Control, the film biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including for Best Film.
Awards were also given to actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and auxiliary actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film to the world.
The prizes were handed over in a ceremony at London’s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot for only <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and best director's debut.
Rock music was the focal point of another laureate at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for the best documentary.
The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said that one of the cells planned to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a domestic statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell headed by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees had planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis seeking to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesperson for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal an outlook on the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet is even more like a distant twin than was previously aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have been very similar to those on Earth, and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plant for a year, provide a sobering glimpse of how Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" Confiscated by Police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesperson said three people were arrested and the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube where normal voters take questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is heading into next year’s elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with those who selected the prospective candidate to show YouTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest that was devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a ballot box when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of being compliant with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two argued particularly fiercely as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of nominating, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they’ve carved on the immigration patrol earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views on the whole: stricter borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now in first place against all expectations in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot up from nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the very beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no Parisian hotel bills paid by politicians, no extramarital toes being sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has concealed donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that would have been good without the contested Gordon Brown.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister evaded the demand for an election to stupidly insult the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once dreaded Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have incited corporate associations against the government.
The tax-administration loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative plucking.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former Chief Executive Officer) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks up towards resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People do not like or trust politicians, but they usually withhold their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-general.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes – as with the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding – voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown’s situation isn’t quite as bad as it looks.
The crimes are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died, or been completely scammed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new attitude towards political donations is a good example.
The Garbosque Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but he did not have the choice.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown hasn’t been involved: there’s nothing to suggest he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the measure full, from a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to be drawn from them" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Public Standards, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through unquestionable integrity and solid competence.
Map sharks
Does the credit crisis fuel America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl excitedly around.
Now that America’s real estate market is crippling, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both debits and default rates that measure the proportion of loans that are not withdrawable or more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer finances, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and gaps are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter plummet rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large portion of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects spending for 2007 to be ultimately 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the flow of money instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial to the card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the properties are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
“We won’t one day wake up and completely reevaluate the loans,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their claims to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron collapsed in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron’s partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron companies that helped to squeeze the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was actually significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper, and others cut about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to conspiracy in two counts for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison term in Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on a $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer disguise billions of debt or make weakening ventures seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is sentenced to more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not down in Moscow.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's a little bit of money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires’ Exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had set up booths, hoping to attract new Russians to anything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s a small amount of money compared to us,” he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be as flooded with money as Dallas was in its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible generous money issuer in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the livelihood minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She visited the fair for the first time together with the brand’s Russian retailer, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they walk through the halls in evening clothes on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, label themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the newcomers, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to spend several hours in traffic to visit a crowded warehouse that flawlessly juxtaposes Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climate change."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-track logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires, or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equip high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requirements, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to linked chain arm tyres, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on those wheels," Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaires” would not currently express much exclusivity, given the rise in local property prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four British-style red telephone cells, stuffed with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaires’ fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the money heaps around, taking cell phone photos as they lean back in the midst of the replacement wealth, getting clipped by friends, or simply getting a couple of millions.
“Look, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected operation suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant and watched as an ambulance on white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another.
“Then I saw the doctor’s body viewer’s box car approaching,” Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, the investigators are trying to determine if she died of a procedure carried out by an unlicensed, cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results might not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the Newark Police leadership.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine if Arroyo died as a result of an unapproved, surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was being questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
The stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts were reinforced by calming comments by the vice-president of the US central bank.
Stock markets increased in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that the policy must respond “flexibly and pragmaticly” to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm thrifty markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said recent turbulence “has partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October.”
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest cuts.
The talks also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The impact of the financial turbulence was underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-reducing measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month European Central Bank guarantee auction granted to European commercial banks was awarded at a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and to feed further capital into the money markets in London rose when credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” loan rates between UK banks rise by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat England number 6 in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electoral candidates, if not for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly it.
It is never easy to nail exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness instead of ability.
It’s not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to go to Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same might also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, both smart young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities do.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain’s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There have been many who have been better in the last season than, for example, than James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and like the wind keels into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in the course of today’s network meeting at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent record against twisted balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in a test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has joy in life by shovel.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was put to the point when he had recently skipped a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and enthusiastically say, "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he taps his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses take refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this point in time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop increase and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who were armed and working with the American military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and draining funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have fled the country’s sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel sectarian tensions again and conflicts will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarland countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Saarlander that we are not French" - this slogan is self-portraited by the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
For example, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries in tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But the children of the state also bring the Saarland in an above-average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people earn their degree at a vocational school, making Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively broadened.
In terms of population, the provision of dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have initiated several reforms in the general education schools after the first Pisa study," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last daycare year is free of charge – a model that other federal states are now copying.
Whether the performance of the students will improve sustainably, will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the share of high-risk students declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And to the dismay of the Saarlanders, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory at high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is changing the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez turned back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, the clocks are set to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States on the world the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cancellation of relations with neighboring Colombia because of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this because of my dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is advancing a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had “spucked Venezuela in the face” with his decision, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is on everyone's lips.
A new cell phone ringtone stirs up excitement in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-America summit was annoyed by the left-wing populist’s constant intervening calls and was driving him over the mouth.
Germans threaten to lose their wages in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect less on the salary account in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
“It’s a blame for the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price fluctuations in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economics Research of the “Bild” newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrück Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products pushed the inflation rate to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the Earth's hellish twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls on the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now, the European probe Venus Express has been able to detect electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings on Venus are shooting at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "Ursoup theory," lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s, no probe has been on its way to specifically explore this planet.
The latest research, which is now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underscores the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed," the ESA said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is nearly the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
However, it revolves much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the large coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights are universal to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed dissatisfaction over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had lamented, among other things, the "show window policy" of the Union in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries, according to information from the SPIEGEL.
China’s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not unload in violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth clashes in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that we don’t build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
However, the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 is "above average".
Above all, more training places must be ensured.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families takes place".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat admonished: "But we still have to be careful."
We need to give young people "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training."
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in service, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, an array of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace of mind.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the wake of the riots, Toulouse was attacked.
The riots ignited in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecution’s initial findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor’s appearance, far from reality, documents that the coalition is ending in terms of content – and that nothing more can be expected of her.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her bleak appearance in the Bundestag’s general debate, which was ugly and low in content, one has to say: not here – not in the country that would have to be ruled by her at last.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is focusing too much on foreign policy with an outrageous sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in danger there.
Example Climate protection: It praises itself unrestrained for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-loathing - so much immodesty the CDU head would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing is coming to people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the realm of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low-income earners?
She has a few side sentences left for it.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three starts to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign ground when it becomes concrete.
Attacks Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney face a tough bout – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He, in turn, counters with serious allegations: “I would say his own house was a port for illegals,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a lot of reading from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the fact that the campaign’s important themes are now beyond the Iraq War and torture debates shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, there is applause in the auditorium.
It shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, snarling and admonishing the base and television audience that he was still one of the proponents of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to his senses when he is asked about his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
A day after he resigned as head of the army, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, repeal the state of emergency and thus fulfill another Western demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with lawyers weighed on him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had dismissed all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the seventies is playing music again: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To revival, a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The envisaged sensation then takes place in the form of three set lords at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a blossom-white shirt at the age of 63.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band plays Harmonia again has caused some excitement among Krautrock enthusiasts.
Here you can reveal: Targeted requests revealed that the name swirled through the collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainably, to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been considered more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can the Echo Prize for their life’s work in 2003, they saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later crouched on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the foreign is one.
Memory is already overwhelmed with harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fledged communards.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in pointed artist existence.
It is said that a pennant of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art were also found in the garbage.
There are some things that Harmony has to say about it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as calm and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
Collecting rice was not just for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-strong record backdrop, as someone believes to remember.
Rother wanted to force harmonica and practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band split up in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
The Gressemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal to cultivate the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
With this the entire range of influences of Krautrock on the following pop music would be outlined.
Harmonia fills the supergroup's empty space.
Brian Eno’s phrase floats with the most peculiar sounds in the room: “The only true music belongs to her the future.”
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the Bauernstube.
Legend formation is used to project further black and white photos of wire-wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to elicit the instruments unheard-of sounds via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technical tinkerers.
The choir of the house does not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they are cuddled and whistled under sound clouds and sung "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful spot with an emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who calls "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be brought out of peace even now.
Even the most natural thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace" again deal with two films about the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and baller or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but especially there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many unimportant roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism exerted the desire for a look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter gets chased" (Why do movie titles have to be as long and messy as locomotive driver fare contracts today?).
In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been of no use if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who, even as a ruinous monument of his decline, has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one quickly falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that even the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flat film loses all too quickly in baller and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored by example, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and scriptwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very similar: both times small teams go into the forest to do something the military can’t and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the outdated cynic with a heart like he's being introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also implicate him with a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the drain when the reporters succeed in the time-lapse process within the last five minutes of what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not achieved in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just vengeance.
This is so bad that one would like to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this case they are supposed to agree, exceptionally) not to carry out the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately I see the swollen veins, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan war film.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always the case: When a star roams the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with “Schindler’s List”.
Some films will still mature – the now considered classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time.
And that robs scriptwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good films.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distancing artist view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Major cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust receives criticism for Olympic cancellation
The mayor’s dismissal of Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a waiver on Wednesday as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, the sporting political momentum would not be able to be sustained in the same way.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to “starting from a changed timeline.”
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed with previous statements on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund expected for the beginning of December on an application by Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
“For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have planned until 2028.”
Still, the dream was not dreamed out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beusts’ statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to get a chance to bury the plans by this time," HSB President Günter Plöß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application would also be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the Olympia map and excluded housing construction," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of housing for the Little Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally set the "event factor".
At the time, the application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg sparked great enthusiasm.
Hamburg had failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently manufactured wooden boxes in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s work directory.
The majority of the ninety-four "Stockholm" Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now come to a sobering conclusion: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet as a gift in 1995, are also copies of the "100th edition of the Art Boxes".
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing combination of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these (for cost reasons) did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonage Factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their role models, about mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporaries now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time have rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has investigated the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three of which were privately owned in Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first primed and trimmed, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint with a paint roller without primer was applied directly to the press chipboard - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "if the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to any other conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the “severe accusations” made in the soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, they have been enveloped in relentless silence.
Rebellion in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have given up.
He cannot be held responsible for bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
About two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently run over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces shut down the district around the prestigious hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila’s financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The insurrection failed after just under 24 hours of refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
An acquisition had been speculated before.
The option to increase the share of versatels is still open.
The move aims to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, presumptions had already arisen about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares to be only a third party, it said on the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP to take over competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of more than ten percent in Freenet and do not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
Freenet poker, which has been ongoing for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
By the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-connection customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has so far held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another around 4%.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
