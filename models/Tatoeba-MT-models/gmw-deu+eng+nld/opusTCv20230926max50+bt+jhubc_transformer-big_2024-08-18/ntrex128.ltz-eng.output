The Welsh deputies are concerned that they look like idiots.
There are a number of members of the House of Representatives who have proposed that their title be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the board of directors are concerned that they will be mocked.
A member of the Labour Party was concerned it would rhyme on Twp and PwP.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dom and pwp cacao.
A representative of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had resolved on the change of name, but stated that MWP and Muppet would not lie far from each other.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting laws to introduce the change of name, said: "The final decision on the appointment of deputies is, of course, with the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received much support.
The Commission has favored "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting about the question of the title of MPs.
Deputies seem to suggest other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for the chairman of the board, Elin Jones, who is expected to enact the bill on the changes within two weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes other changes, such as the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of deputies and the design of the committee system.
Members will receive the last word on the question as to how they should be called when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians are much in favour of the referendum on the names of the country.
The people will choose on Sunday whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was drawn up in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its accession attempts for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the change of name, said he did not want to recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price to be paid to allow the EU to appeal to NATO.
The claws of St. Martin's Church are as quiet as the churches during the Harlem battle
"Early people said that there was a cafe and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"There's nothing left today."
He said that the coffee shop's disappearance was understandable.
“Societies are socializing,” he said.
"They don't want to be in the middle of people's habits."
As for the churches, he is worried that the money of selling property values will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
He added that he could be replaced by apartment owners with property owners and filled with people who did not help the remaining shelter areas in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to quickly close these churches because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist community was moved in the 1930s.
A black community from not far away took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main street for trade in Harlem, who did not want to hire blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for the reconstruction, they ordered the clay play.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's boob and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clairvoyant "The clairvoyant of the poor."
The expert who played the slack game in July called it otherwise: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell-playing game, played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell-playing game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some were introduced by laymen, others by the bishoprics.
In July, the Sakristei – the leading body, with lay leaders – wrote the dioceses, with the concern that the dioceses “would try to pass on the costs to the sakristei”, although the sakristei did not take part in the appointment of architects and entrepreneurs who were the dioceses.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency of pages of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-olds while lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he was diving into lobsters in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been with friends on the dip for half an hour since he heard the boy calling for help and you were paddled over with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had thought at first that it would simply be the joy of catching a lobster, then "recognised that he was crying 'I was hurt!'"
I'm going to give it up!"
"His whole body was broken," he said as he approached the boy.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" he added.
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was delivered in critical condition.
The nature of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen a few weeks ago, but this was considered a non-hazardous shark.
Giles also said that the victims of traumatic injuries were in the hands of the workers.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for security purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's climbs into the beauties of Great Britain.
Sainsbury's adopts boots, superdrug and Debenhams, with Kafhaus-style beauty departments with specialized assistants.
As part of a significant promotion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion returns to home furnishings, these larger beauty departments and 11 stores across the country, and the next year and more businesses if successful.
Supermarkets invest in the beauty because they want to fill up the shelves that were otherwise reserved for the TVs, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said they would scale the size of its beauty offering up to 3,000 products with, among others, Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The assortments of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which have become current, will also receive more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat stores.
The supermarket also once again launches its boutique make-up brand, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly required by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online in small amounts of everyday food and small businesses means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to get people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the owner of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would look more and more like department stores, as the supermarket chain attempted to fight more services and non-food products against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' opened Argos Oulettes in hundreds of after-hours and also bought some Habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago. This increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's vigorous attempt to revise the cosmetics and pharmacy department has failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the cooperation was quickly overturned after a dispute over the share of revenue from the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drugs to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys should play a role in the plan by introducing an enlarged range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old ways of shopping in the shade."
Peter Jones "sweet" over a <0xC2><0xA3>11-million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star from Dragons Den, has become "weak" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old actress announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, out of her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business in the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "sweezy" as the TV star during an upcoming meeting spent a decade in the main quarter of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitting that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she didn't have time for her homewear and accessory brand anymore.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would truly leave, Jones fled from the UK and went to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly, Holly was by far the top priority.
It would have been her long-term future that she would be looking forward to the next century.
The decision to leave was a surprise to all the people concerned.
No one could believe what was going on at the beginning.
In the main quarter in Marlow, there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that leaving the this-morining moderator, who is one of the bankable stars from Great Britain, could cost the company millions because they invested a lot in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and there are now potentially further delays for the launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin stood up to Jones and his wife Tara Capp since ten years after.
Willoughby took off with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, stepped in as president in March.
The couple joins forces in the Jones holiday and is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night "We won't comment on his business affairs."
We're going to go out of our way, and then we're going to fall in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media because of a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "TV moderator's voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization, however, do not occur.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leading politicians at the UN General Assembly a Saturday that the North did not see a "reasonable response" from the US to North Korea's former disarmament crackdown.
Instead, the U.S. will continue to use sanctions to push further.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're talking about North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – no more rocket tests, aid to liberate hostages, and the rape of American soldiers who fell in the fight of mortally ill-fated rockets, captured the targets, and captured the free hostages.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about the relationships with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to people right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign ONGes were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national catastrophe has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, many have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to work on foreign personnel on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster protection administrator, said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the aid measures.
Unfortunately, in relation to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, there isn't anywhere on the coast.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning sire in Palu, although there has been a warning, probably cost a lot of life.
Travelling between different Indian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake apes makes its way to Palu, but takes at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of the futtissed Indonesian infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's line was also plotted by a lack of funding, where he resigned next year.
Mr. Joko is also exposed to the pressure of partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes, as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bows and files and other brutal weapons on the road.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the game to a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with a goal in the 89th minute a Samsden at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal and his team leaned 1-0.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot towards the gold.
Attempts are high over the box, heading towards the right corner of the net.
The ball flew over a jumping arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just about getting into this position, getting the ball and playing games like Shaq always as much as possible before, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge and touched it once, and didn't think about it and just shot."
Chelsea was 1-0 after the break ahead by a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues starman made a pass back to the Mateo Kovacic in this game before sprinting towards Liverpool halfway.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot through a beautiful ball that sent the hazard into the box.
Hazard walks past the defense and ends at the long poto with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832.
The death toll in Indonesia due to earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the agency's spokesman, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that had been destroyed by the earthquakes of a magnitude of 7.5 and caused the wave of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murder was conducted after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. in Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People from the area who have seen or heard something should report to the police.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also like to get in touch with every other person, especially taxi drivers who have recorded something on Dashcam footage, because they may have information that may be important to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that a woman who had been found her body was living in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
These nominees are friends who think they know the woman coming to the scene to ask questions about where she was found the moie.
The police continued to conduct investigations and informed other relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, now just wants to go back to his residence, but the police told him that at the moment no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People are now told that it may take hours for them to return home.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is currently considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She replies, “It’s so awful.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police camionnets were inside the lockdown and another outside the lockdown.
A few police officers were standing inside the building and were guarding the building.
Anyone who has any information should contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of the Parliament will be the new memorial stone, which is affected by the series "Rewrite History."
His exile was a poetic justice for the destruction of such many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatics and puritan adherents of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "unsense" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the discussion about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the design of Oliver Cromwell was targeted at the Palace of Westminster.
The symbolism of the English civil wars was not ordered by Cromwell nor carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell for the actions would have been sacrificed by his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroftseng's grandiose representation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure, of which still many people believe that it will be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as today, as a defender of parliament against the external pressure, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a very accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy to be celebrated and remembered.
The pig is a farmer's
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery near a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported a Sunday.
A guinea pig is preparing for an injection of vaccines for pigs in a farmhouse on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he was traveling with his cousin from Yunnan Province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby swastika.
He said that in the stall there was a large male pig with blood on the beak.
A court-medical investigation confirmed that a 550-pound heavy pig destroyed the farmer to death, according to reporters.
"Many cousin's legs were bludgeoned and faded," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The images of surveillance cameras show the Yuan Thursday morning at 4:40 go to the market to feed the pig.
His body was shattered an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A source from the market explained to the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while the police were gathering evidence on the spot.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the authorities of the market are presumably negotiating compensations for his death.
Even though they were dead, they were attacked by pigs.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her home in Massachusetts. The man was severely injured.
In 2006, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 heavy pig pushed a Welsh farmer back his tractor until his wife was able to keep the animal alive.
After a farmer was frozen by his pig in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They're just playful.
They're just squeamish, they don't want to kill you.
"You just have to show respect," he said.
Southwest of the United States by hurricane Rosa
As predicted, hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cold waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, the pink floods in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States will occur in the coming days.
The rose has winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. eastern time a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will move a sunshine into the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean, heading towards the west coast of the United States, and the rose can increasingly approach the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to impress deep tropical humidity from the north to the southwest U.S.
The rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the more approaching channel, will form widely distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mud flows, and possible droughts in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes slugs of 2 to 3 inches per hour in different locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 centimeters of rain are expected in parts in the southwest, especially many in Arizona.
Floods are possible, with weather conditions becoming worse and worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-sensible to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical locks.
These rains can cause canyons that quickly become rivers and thunderstorms will bring local rough air and dust.
The more approaching canal will bring thick local rain and parts of the southern California coast.
They are made up of small pieces of wood, which can lead to small sludge flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first race in the season.
A few distributed tropical recluses begin to get closer to Arizona, in late Sundays and early Mondays, before the ride continues to spread, in late Mondays and Thursdays.
It will be distributed in the four corners of the dice and on a Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the drops remain quite hot.
Hessianism leads to dramatic changes in temperature over small distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sunshine in the center of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In many central and eastern United States, a warm start will be expected in October with wide spread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast provides high chances of surplus temperatures for the east of the U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people have watched a Thursday's grabbing statement at Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court and wife, Christine Blasey Ford, which he accused of sexual rape, which is set to happen in the 1980s, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political Sakgaass continues, and the broadcasters have interrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a Friday: an agreement signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of the preliminaries.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was fully chasing her and tried to expel her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people have watched the trial with pleasure.
The company has accounted for an average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that transferred the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In Nielsen, there are often some difficulties to count people who are looking at offices.
To illustrate the whole thing: The viewer's number reflects that of a playoff football match or the Oscar overreach.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators have supported Kavanaugh's appointment, has led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the trial over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The interest remains high in the process.
The film was the central figure in the drama of Free Deal.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he became a friar the morning of demonstrations while attempting to launch a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood a few minutes with his eyes down while he was yelled at and was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the land?
He said, "You have power, while so many women have no power."
Flake said his office would have taken a position and before the elevator closed, he would have to say more after hearing the committee.
The cable and radio networks all reported live at a later time, as the Judicial Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the rulings against the nominee for next week, which Democrats wanted minority.
Flake was partly convinced of the conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing the politics" regarding Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the UK's future and weaken national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, next to her on the newspaper's cover, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson interrupted her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes against each other would be "very ridiculous."
Wayde-Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for murder of the second degree, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons and the police said the Sims lost their sights in the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA there, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson's death, the police said he had admitted to shooting the Wayde.
His deposit was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner released a provisional report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the refugee officers of the Louisian State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents for the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "quiet and search for justice."
The Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01-metre tall man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
The LSU basketball coach said Friday that his team was "destroyed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," said Wade.
Volcanoes in Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano's spawned ash reached southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Catastrophe Protection warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, registering 183 gas and ash sessions in the last 24 hours.
The center had a few thunders and thunders.
Images on social networks show thin ash layers on the cars and neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in volcanic activity, which has shaken 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-strong earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters disagreed with the police, and how thousands participated in the rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarising election for the separation.
A group of masked pro-separtists were held back in riots against the police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
The police also broke out later in the day, and the police took out their buttons to control the fighters.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups have called "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" against Unionists who have called "Long Lives Spain."
Fourteen people have been hospitalized without injuries to the protesters, reports the local press.
Tensions remain high in the independence region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for majority to become independent, but the result was low against the separation by the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after Polce tried to stop the election in the electoral offices through the region of violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration on the support of the national police.
The protest continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has hope for the prospect of an independent Catalonia.
“Last year, I had a good time.
I saw my parents crying out of joy, because they could go a long way, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan independence parties have struggled to stay in swing this year. Most of the most well-known leaders have been in exile or in prison and have been on their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who accepted the protest on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict was heated by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more exciting," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the pre-emptive prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will participate in the European elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression and democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government is to stand," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested Nodeems Car Running at Home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car ran back to a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent in Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said there is damage to the couples and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an armored bust was shot on the car.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers through Menga's gold.
Dolly Menga's first gold won.
Promoted Livingston eliminates the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second win and 18 games as manager of Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference in how Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side will remain unmatched in the Premiership this season and play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, which are eight points ahead of them.
Rangers Rapid Vienna have won the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still enjoying the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's campaign against open-ended visitors.
His team should have had the news long before the hit, because his directness caused the ranger problems.
Scott Robinson has penetrated but has carried his effort to the front of the gold, then Alan Lithgow can only aim his effort before meeting Craig Halkett in front of the gold.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery to the visitors.
That's how the gold fell.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play on the Menga, who once touched and met the center of the box.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the property but found the home defense inpenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers Golkipp Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide from yet another game train from Livingston.
Crosses always came back into Livingston's box and were always cleaned up, while two elven meters were demanded - after the halket challenged the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were deflected.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
It's a great result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations in this high way.
Their style of play and staff has hardly changed since returning to the top curse, but big credit has to go to the woods for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, a super organized defense led by Menga, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through on their zeal.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass felt – only when they opened the home page – and it was something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who had joined in the middle field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is receiving a reception in Cologne.
There were laughter in the open sky on Saturday (29 September) when the heads of Turkey and Germany saw themselves drinking coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They talked about problems including human rights, freedom of the press in Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan was on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have stepped up to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – have also heard their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protesters all reflect the divisions of a visitor who is welcomed as a hero of several German Turks and as a monarch of others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Disorder
Six gypsies were injured in an involuntary incarceration in a high-security prison for men, the prison officer said.
Unordered broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were brought in to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a plane.
The officers were placed on the spot for small wounds in the face.
A spokesperson for the prison said: Specially trained prison personnel were deployed to take care of the incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that the responsibility of the police could be referred and spent longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous perpetrators in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, offensive officers were called to prison to deal with a severe disorder in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare to meet a tropical depression Arizona, but that's what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week as the hurricane Rosa sung last energy down through the southwestern desert pulls and brings flooding risks.
The national rainstorm has already cleared floods for Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct way over Phoenix's thinking and come closer to rain sooner.
The National Reconsideration in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only “ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 centimetres of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, can reach 1 to 2 centimetres, with isolated numbers up to 4 centimetres.
For those without flooding risks, Rosa's rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, a bit of rain will probably be good because in the south-west are currently dry conditions.
The United States, according to Just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com said.
Hurricane Rosa is heading for the country across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power a Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is rotting on more deadly water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore losing strength.
So, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on the Monday in the afternoon or evening.
Rain on parts of Mexico could be difficult, putting a significant flood risk.
"Early rainfall of 3 to 6 centimetres is expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 centimetres possible," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border and early morning as a tropical depression, where it will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected by Rosa or his remnants is severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States' southwestern desert," the national hurricane center said.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mud flows in the desert, and draughts in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton has been arrested for four murders.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the vicinity of the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m.
When he was brought to the hospital, his health condition would be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man have been arrested at night near Radstock, the police of Avon and Somerset.

Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the unity and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the very recklessness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally recounted the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford before Congress that he should have sexually harassed them while they were still teenagers.
Ford has also vowed that there will be a vote here.
The president told a Samsden that "the American people saw the splendor and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"To confirm a vote for Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of dead to the public.
President Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican electoral participation in the half of the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I've gone everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump has argued that he is on a mission to "get and slow down."
The first Senate-level election for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place, a high-profile employee told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many were floating away as huge waves hit the coast, like a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities at Samsden said.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Fridays when 6-meter-high waves struck the coast in the half-darkness, killing many and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami was threatening yesterday, people were still on the beach following their activities and did not immediately run away," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster protection agency at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, cabins, Hziser, it took everything on land with it," Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami on the sea had speeds of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed on trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centers in Palu.
Air capture made public by catastrophe protection showed many buildings and butts that were destroyed, bridges that were pulled away and collapsed into a mosque that surrounded all of the water as well.
The squirrels were on their way to the coast.
The death toll has been recorded in a region of 2.4 million people.
The agency for the evaluation and use of technology said in a communication that the energy released during the earthquake was the power of 200 times the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic situation of the city at the end of a long-drawn bay may have further increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the shelter as "extreme" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that the injuries and damage could be great on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in the area called the Doggola and close to the epicentre people.
The communication "as completely collapsed and we are without information" from Donggola, so does Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a communiqué, saying that their staff and volunteers are on the road in the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
Samsden's agency has been widely criticized for not having met Tsunami Palu, officials said the waves came out at the same time as the warning went out.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher stack warning by calling you on the street below before the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and moves buildings and cars.
Reuters was only able to directly confirm the pictures.
The earthquakes and the tsunami caused a massive power outage and the communication of round-the-clock palpable water would make it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army has first sent transport planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, so far the authorities, but the evacuated still need urgent food and things for the most important needs.
The local airport was only opened for rescue teams and will be delayed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800.
It's as bad as ugly.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola safely arrived in Palu City as, where the employees were interrupted in tents on the grounds of their office, some scenes of destruction had to be on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"I've been told that there are a lot of people who have been devastated," he said.
It's as bad as ugly.
As soon as the aid teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with great experience were only allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, material and personnel may only enter the country if the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
It's just that Dawg happens.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As the government says, 'Okay, it's a national disaster,' we can open up for international aid but that's not yet happening."
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of his joys, friends and families hope that here is missing among those miracles you will always appear after such catastrophes.
It's like being rescued from a canal.
A rescuer freed a woman who was buried under a coup debris, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders that have been deducted for the Asian players,
The other students from the Roa Roa Hotel were students, according to Mr. Mandagi.
"As an old man in the paraglider, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said like him, in the hours after the news where the rumor of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group went round, WhatsApp messages were sent to the team who participated in the Beach Festival.
Unfortunately, his news was only drawn with a hook, and only with two blue hooks.
"I think it's just a matter of sacrificing things," he said.
Robber stole $26,750 while filling a machine in Newport/Levee.
The robbers said on Friday that a Brink's security guard who was about to fill in a bancomat had stolen $26,750 in Newport/Levee, according to a letter from the Newport police.
Chauffer was about to make the bancomat empty in a entertainment complex and was about to pay the money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was busy, another man "came from behind the Brink's employee" and stole his money case that should have just been delivered.
There have been more suspects who have escaped from the scene, but the police have only been told how much it would have been.
Anyone with information about the identity should contact the Police of Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Twitter, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has since been called Ye and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes together with his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the launch of his new album is expected.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" only can in the show, as well as the founder of the show.
Although it is an abbreviation to his professional name as, the West has previously said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' as the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West told me early in the year, at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"I'm the sea, I'm the sea.
It comes from Kanye, that means the only one, to only Ye - the mirror of our good, our evil, our darkness, everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous rappers.
Sean Combs has been named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to go for Love and Brother Love.
A former Westerner, Jay-Z, has always played with small and large-scale songs.
In Mexico, the U.S. military has threatened to attack civilians.
In the run-up to the 50-year celebrations of the bloody hostility against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to incite the military against the civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised to Samsden "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops shot at the people and killed 300 at a time when the left-handed ruck went through Latin America.
The Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans are supported by monthly grants to students and by the opening of more free universities.
He has said that he has been the victim of criminal harassment and the death penalty.
The U.S. would double the funding of the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come as more and more from circles of the U.S. government hear that the U.S. has no right strategy in researching the AI.
Meanwhile, China's plan has introduced the latest year: the first in the research of AI will be by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next leap in the U.S. will be measured, Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" came out this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as Director General at Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most famous companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, later becoming Director General at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew of the previous technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and was wondering when they would be next to help find the next visionaries.
The U.S. government often has to work hard to get state aid, Lee said.
"It's not just China that accepts the academic leaders; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have engaged the lumiairs in the last years of the universities to work on AI.
Lee Soot's improved immigration law could also boost AI research in the United States.
"I think the Green Card is automatically offered to professors in the AI, as he says.
The Chinese government launched its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations will make for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is not as good, according to LEE.
Early this year in the United States, the Department of Defense established a joint AI center to bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the founding of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA has invested $2 trillion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which is currently investing over $100 million in AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. government has to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months to come.
Macedonia decides on a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia have changed their name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday to defuse a threat to their oral dispute with Greece, which prevents admission and membership into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of Noopeshland is trying to make the province stand out and has enacted its veto against its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign showed that it would be difficult to achieve the required 50% for the elections to apply.
In a statement, the president said, "You are for a NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Changes in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be payable for a take-off in such organizations as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people live free under the premise of the European Union because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it's legal, many members of parliament have said that they are willing to vote on the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required for the change of name.
The state election committee would not be able to report any inconsistencies in the elections until 13 a.m.
Nevertheless, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections where 66 percent of voters voted.
"I've come to celebrate my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have announced in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name for the way to NATO and to the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, has set up a small stage in silence in front of the tents of those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get up high, only through the back animals," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they want us to be just like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev's soot NATO membership would bring our major investments to Macedonia, according to Chomagetaux having more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority are therefore more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU," said Zaev after leaving the electoral cabin.
He said that "yes" would be the "confirmation for our future."
A poll by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research last Monday showed that 30 percent and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than expected.
Another question, from the Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of the respondents had planned to vote for him on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent of them are squeezed.
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 percent plus one must vote.
It would be the first time that the pro-Western government has taken a step back.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero breaks through the entire defence of Brighton and makes a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed ‘Defense from Brighton to Manchester City and went 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero quickly lowered the ball in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean storm hit a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the run.
He ran as the third defender of Brighton and then opened his field.
Aguero then faced four opponents.
He's got a squirrel in the back of his head, and he's got another squirrel in the back of his head.
He was on his way to where the Sterling took over.
The Englishman, as with the first ball touching the field, rushed forward and matched Aguero back, who put the ball in the right corner with the right foot of Brighton's goalkeeper.
"The Aquero is currently having minor problems in its feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've been waiting for him to play for 55, 60 minutes.
Dawg as it happened.
I'm glad he scored his goal at the time."
But there was the sterling that the Sky Blues had the initial advantage in the Premier League gin.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aquero crossed the ball far in the middle of Brighton.

The game against the Rockies
With the selection of the nationals in the playoff, as a reason to force a new start.
But the joker who is always ready for a challenge hopes to take the overhand against the Colorado Rockies, but only when the Rockies are still in the playoffs that are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers and the NL West.
The Rockies clung to a wild-card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals a Friday night, but still struggled to secure their title in the first division.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can make a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I do that?"

Trump's election in West Virginia
The President has pointed to the situation rounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Eternal House while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these midterm elections.
"Everything I've seen is going to happen in November.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This as one of the big, big — I'm not running but I'm really running for that I'm fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terribly, terribly radical groups of Democrats, you see how it is happening now.
And those who are determined to take the power back under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the community.
"No matter who they are, who they have to overcome to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
"And you see day in the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "rosen and senseless and dishonest and lost."
He mentions the Judiciary Senate Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's name, which was heaviest elaborated.
"Do you remember the answer here?"
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, Waat.
"No, no, I'm guessing - it was a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever had."
Work is no longer God's.
It is intolerant to those who think.
When I heard the voices of the activists in my electoral office, I was a little overwhelmed.
Finally, I'm the last one from a working party that gets me soaked up - just because we would like to think.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is treated as similar because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me because I wasn't right with Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt's view on the importance of a responsible entry into the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically, similar circumstances in which Jeremy has been criticized by senior leaders.
The note for Nottingham East Workers' Meeting at Freiden says that "we want our meeting inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight-year-olds as a local worker, the Friday evening meetings were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, as day only sounds more at many meetings and promises of "my kind, my fine" politics than ever since forgotten, anyway, it has ever been so.
It is becoming increasingly frustrating that other opinions are only tolerated in the Workers' Party and any opinion is considered to be unacceptable than for the partisanship.
This as soon as Jeremy's leadership took over, as colleagues with whom I had previously done, we would have remembered similar political views on once that I would have taken the turn and relate to positions that I would never have assumed otherwise - in national security as well as in the EU interior fashion.
Every time I went public - and it's not really important waad I say - I then get a tirade of comments on social media against the politics of the middle, and we say I don't have my place in the Workers' Party.
It's just my experience.
Nevertheless, I know that I am better off than any of my colleagues because the comments I receive are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and who are close to not looking away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is as the level of abuse becomes more and more normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement last week that the Workers' Party has embraced a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer God's being and with every "non-trust" movement or change of choice the party is becoming more and more sound.
In the last two years, I got a lot of advice to keep me quiet, not to be too harsh, and then I was "in the row."
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by a lack of support from the Thatcher government during which my classroom almost collapsed, I have tried to improve the public services for those who need it the most – whether as a local politician or as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political position and the points at which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who favor the movement of joy, all I want to say is when the country meets a Brexit, that this protects the state, trade and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my trip to the Labour Party.
But the only message I have concerns the Nottingham momentum, it's for my voters, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will stop me from acting on it, on what I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr unbeaten no uewen
Two attempts in recent times have increased the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now on the top, the only one hit by 10.
Finally, it was a better defense, just like the better grabbing of chances, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie could be pleased about.
"We've been challenged in our matches so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they've gotten the chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, led by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr near, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which he got in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unconverted attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty for Ayr, just before half-time, he then tried to convert himself to the 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well in Patrick Anderson's run, implemented by Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to the Ruaridh Knott, who was fouled, in a refurbishment, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, enforced by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to take advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tied the climo without a ball on the strooflin, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of the attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to transform as he did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe was able to catch David Armstrong's kickoff and lead the flank player Gregor Henry to his fifth run.
Looking forward to a new career in the hotel industry
Ford Kieran, a star player, is looking to switch to hotels, after it emerged that he was nominated director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the well-known BBC broadcast, in which he plays as a co-star with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next 9 episodes are the last of the show, and Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor lends any comment on the story, although a source from the "Scottish Sun" has revealed that Kiernan has entered "the thriving restoration industry" of Glasgow.
The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol under tackelage in the main quarter of La Paz.
The building was built with an ocean-blue flag.
The marine bases from Titicaca to the Amazon River run under the motto: "The sea belongs to us rightly.
It is our duty to take it back."
Bolivia is still alive throughout the country, remembering a coast lost in a conflict in the 19th century to Chile – the intention is to sail back out to the Pacific Ocean.
Now the hope is great as never, because Bolivia awaits a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the passion, the spirit of cohesion and freedom and, of course, hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the International Court's decision on large screens in the hope that The Hague will be decided in favour of Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – forced Chile to negotiate with Bolivia on sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – whose controversial fight for re-election is advocating the next year – puts a lot on the talks of a Monday.
"We're heading back to the Pacific," he said.
But some analysts believe that the court may not be in favor of Bolivia – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN agency, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no power over Chile and has stated that it does not engage in any conversations.
The decision of the court was made six months after the final negotiations showed that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the case of the Bolivians, the last four years have been disastrous.
"The issue of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian government," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales' combative rhetoric weakened all Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile continue to speak at some point, but then it is very difficult to pre-empt the conversations after that.
The two countries had no ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, as a Bolivian representative in The Hague, denied that the decision of the court was particularly soon taken.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and "a chance to end a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the maritime exit as a political springboard.
"Bolivia never ceases to declare its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"It's an opportunity for us to leave our past behind."
North Korea says a nuclear disarmament does not happen before it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to keep its promises given to the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to cancel nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore revived with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions in the U.S.'s approach against a declaration for the Korean War would force Korea into its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration, without Pyongyang taking first steps in the direction of a massive disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang seriously believes in the disarmament of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows a massive rise of caps on the streets.
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled at the Catwalk a bunch of oversized headgear for their SS19 collection, putting the style at the Paris Fashion Weeks in the spotlight.
Absolutely impractical heat flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something that resembled a feather and flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories with beautiful watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released some funny masks – just right for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks have abutted lips and are more similar to the Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creature resembles a diving costume complete with snorkeling and glasses, while another looks like a molten glacecornet.
And if you want to see my face, you will not be disappointed.
Keep in mind that you'll be able to find your way to the top of the road.
The overdimensioned heat resembles the feast of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide board, which one has already seen at Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical heat that flooded the social media sends a big creation to the catwalk – a straw beach cemetery as big as the model it introduces.
The deep orangutan bast cemetery, with bast fringes and a white song grave, was the main focus in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see great heat and sandy pegs on our streets next summer – because designers have achieved such a great impact, it is difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic performance and this continued in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), want to pursue the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for further and higher schools, for their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As a school with a decent and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your own language, it will go into your heart."
This is a strong reminder that we are not only allowed to rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since these exams, we can see that languages are very high, with the best results within the independent schools.
68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages had cut off with an A+.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students had an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people need without a doubt in the future.
Languages as electives are now considered to be the same as majors (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also inevitably different.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission for Professions and Skills found that patrons indicated that it was difficult to fill free posts, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming more and more important for young people to prepare for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career one chooses when learning a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in England from 2013, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, while French as a single language with 15 percent still comes into the two-tiered area.
This is why it is so important to invest in the learning of languages in today's children.
Multilingualism, especially those of growing economies, provides children with better chances of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, all schools offer different languages.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while learning other languages that might be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a bunch of languages in the independent schools to choose from, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are eager to provide a learning environment that prepares the children and equip them with the skills they need to achieve something no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be argued in a global business environment that languages are vital for the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer these whales, variety and expansive performance for the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is directly in the Scottish Red for independent schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the finds waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Trainer Luke Walton of the Lakers announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It only needs to be determined how many minutes he is playing.
"It's more than one in less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Like winning, James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's Whaling Tour in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a bright wave of whale event campaigns.
It is Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him friendly-minded places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative vote in favour of his election for the post of Supreme Court judge, Trump dismisses the support for the upcoming mid-term elections, from which Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the elections are held in November.
At what time is Trump's West Virginia whale event tonight and how do you look at it online?
Trump's election for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Samsden, September 29, 2018, 19:00 ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia whale event online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would mention the suspension of this week for Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, whose ballot was filed a week before the FBI investigated the case because of the allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator.
But the first goal is to help the Republicans get face-to-face with the elections in November and get a new swing.
President Trump's campaign said the five events in the next week had the goal of "giving free and supporters new energy, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the important time of the campaign," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event can bring evening supporters from "Ohio, Pennsylvania and be treated by the media of Pittsburg," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Samsdeg is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senatorial candidacy for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, back in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to help him get involved in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 The U.S. team demonstrates courage in the fight for the hopes of keeping single fights alive on Sunday
After three one-sided meetings, the four fights can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging swing pendulum is a very invented sports concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more so in such competitions as this.
Where do you think it's going to be the slingshot?
"They had a lead of six points and now it's four more, so we now see it as a small swing," Jordan Spieth said as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points ahead to play with twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to be mounted on, not at the end the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and both go on with three out of four points.
Spieth was deadly from tea to the green and is an example.
The joyful chewing became harder as his round progressed, sinking an important pit for the match to tear up and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His pit, through which they won the match on 15, was acknowledged with a similar creek, of which sort, a kind that he believes the American team is not out there.
"It's just a matter of digging deep enough and taking care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's going on with this game.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but popular couples are four out of four ahead and can't do anything wrong anymore.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Saturday morning walls, Friday afternoon walls, and the nine back a Friday walls Bogeye.
On this run, and just as their energy seems to flow at and from the viewers, cements that they are the players who will be allowed to strike it a Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to take on a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, like the Fleetwood and the Molinari.
At the same time, the two of them are in different shapes.
Even though it's a win over Europe, it's a win over Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Moien at Fourball, when he was a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Sword in a laugh from which they could not get out so quickly.
No one is there to help you get rid of the laughter.
The four-balls and four-players are so fascinating to look at because of the interactions between the pairings; the turn they give; the turn they don't give in the way a strategy can change in a glance.
Europe has so far played better as a team and gone well and lead for the last day, but this four-player session has also shown that the Team USA has the will to fight for what has been doubted, especially the Stateside.
Europe to go 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the Fourth ball of a Samsden and the Fourth match against the United States with 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two wins over a fluctuating Tiger Woods for their lead at four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a poorly-run American side in the four-ball series at 3-1.
The United States offers more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they do not receive the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of 12 individual matches to hold a sunshine for the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while in Molinari, together "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend only the second pair are the four points since the first four matches in Ryders Cup history.
Aside from Woods and Patrick Reed winning in four-ball, they are well-harmonized against a vain Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who himself won two matches at Samsden, sometimes showed brilliant breakouts in the four balls and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, paused in the Four Balls Moies, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the Fours and beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third list in the world.
Europe doesn't just have it on a beautiful, lively day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the baton for the Americans with two points at Samsden.
They recovered a grabbing 2&1 victory over the spinners Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals and later came back to win against the poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the quarter-finals despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team hated a come back from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, although Furyk's side only needed to keep the trophy.
After they were second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday looked like they didn't want to.
North Korea says ‘in no way' they would unilaterally disarm without trust
The North Korean foreign minister has told the United Nations at Samsden that continuing sanctions will deepen the mistrust of the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea has shown a lot of "good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and not increasing Zouso nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No matter what, we don't see an equal response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While the Ri reiterated the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-stage approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for the individual steps, he stressed his statement in which he did not explicitly dismiss a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had always done in the past.
Ri is referring to a joint letter from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit on June 12th, an official U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States resigned Pyongyang to first open its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also appealed for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on the 'denuclearization-first' and increases the pressure by sanctions to enforce itself in a compulsive manner, and raises appeal against 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that the sanctions could force us to the knees is a dream of people who do not know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deprive us of our mistrust."
Mr. Ri did not say anything of plans for a second summit to test Kim and Mr. Trump, who was a U.S. leader before the United Nations.
In a statement, he said: "If the South Korean denuclearization party were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a case."
Just like that, the sound of the Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of the last year, as it aired before the UN General Assembly that targets on the U.S. mainland of North Korean missiles were triggered by the "Lord Devil President" Trump when he called Kim a "raket man" on a suicide mission.
This year on the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the first step towards disarmament, but said that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
Trump said he didn't have a schedule for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia are calling for the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must continue and in any case be sustained until we have realized a whole, final and proven denuclearization."
The Security Council has intensified unanimous sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in the hope that it will be able to reject Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program through the withdrawal of funds.
Pompeo met the Council behind the scenes of the United Nations General Assembly and said that next month he would go back to Pyongyan to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit hasn't gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced it for its "gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantling a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the Americans were to take "decent measures."
He said that Kim would use "depressive measures" to seek security guarantees that Trump has secured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have a lot to offer.
A new course at Harvard University encourages all of its students to get more sleep and thus combat the growing macho culture in which one goes through the night with coffee in the blood.
One academic found out that students from the university, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham's Women's Hospital, assembled the court, which is the first in the field in America.
He was inspired to start the court, after a four-solution on the influence of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
"At the end of the four-year resolution, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I going to get this right now, in my last year?'
He said that so far no one has told him anything about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Court, which is offered for the first time this year, explains the essentials of how good sleep habits can help academics and sports perform, as well as a general sense of well-being can bring with them.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business leader of the university's health services, said that the university decided to offer the court after noticing that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which takes an hour, offers a range of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a dorm is shown where students can click on coffees, rides, sports shoes and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lure, but also how athletic performance is affected by sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, those involved learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A short course of university education, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth the student's behavior.
But we believe that they have a right to know this – just as one has a right to know what health problems the smoking of cigarettes brings with them," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of having learned to brag all night long still exists, so the professor, and the modern technology and pressure on the students, which is getting bigger, has as a consequence a lack of sleep and is a problem that is getting bigger and bigger.
He said that ensuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, exertion and fear - even to prevent one from contributing, wanting to put sleep deprivation into starvation and one's feeling to be hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, even after choosing one of his courses at Harvard last year in his first year.
He said the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to worship the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to bring all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm as to when they should go to bed, but also to stand up, and pay attention to harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED loudspeakers and which can cause distributed rhythms from the runway during the day and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal hits Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered a further defeat due to Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's low-coherence side to a 1-0 draw.
Ibrox's side have been trying to secure their first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team has brought Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a coach and left eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half-time and the line-up of the Rangers team made it to inspiration and couldn't get along.
While the Rangers are now slipping to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third, behind Hiberian through the difference in the goals.
And there could be further problems coming to the Rangers after Abiter had to wear Calum Spence for a head wound, and this because of an object that was apparently shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard turned eight times sideways, giving him the opportunity to loosen Ayr behind and get into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the name Livi 11, which cost Hearts a point the last week and would be thrilled to see his well-turned team hit opponents every time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more of a match with the ball they had.
They could have scored a goal for two minutes in the game as Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance too far.
A deep free kick from Keaghon Jacobs to Captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the opportunity to shoot from far away on the poles.
The Rangers were able to win control, but it looked more like hope than faith and her game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he would have had an ellipse after a quarter of a mile as he ran into Steven Lawless, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers have only scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly has almost no problem dismissing Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one could claim that they did not deserve it for this effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers failed to agree with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shot the ball between Scott Robinson, who kept a cold head and selected Menga for a simple goal.
Gerrard responded in the break and kicked out Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which had practically a direct impact as the alien overtook Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came down from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the genre of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of their lead in the last few moments, but McGregor kept Jacobs de Bass before shooting Lithgow from afar a corner.
The Rangers here inverted Glenn Middleton had a further late right to an ellipse as Jacobs got together, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac, the inventor of the Geigerzieler
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago exactly on the day, and still further CHOOSED... the spear physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" violinist was born in Germany.
The violinist has developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violinist's targets.
The violinist, since becoming a major supporter of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who resembled more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What is that then?"
Rogers: "This is a geiger target that is used to localize radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you read the headphones, you can hear the effects emitted by the atoms through radioactivity and the minerals."
Evans: "Well, now it's going to be fine!"
The "Hans" violinist died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the name of the man who was named after him is still alive.
New cancer vaccination can help the immune system to discover additional cells
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system to detect and kill adjunct cells
Vaccination contributes to the immune system as it can recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the medhode, immunity cells are taken by a patient and then converted into laboratory
They can then recognize a protein that is present in many cancer cells and then re-injected.
A test vaccination has promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccination, which contributes to the recognition of malignant cells to the immune system, the cancer of the ovaries has disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immunity cells are removed from a patient, then altered in the laboratory, so that they recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then resuscitate the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccination."
HER2 "drives the growth of different types of cancer," including breast, ear plugs, lungs and tooth cancers, as Prof Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immunity cells from patients and "adding" them, as one cancer cells has already been able to cope with in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tyre, with a MAGA cap, after his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during the show Saturday Night Live, after a far-reaching performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump rang and said he would be presidential candidate for 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening called Ghost Town, he wore a cap with the cape of Make America Great, staggered against the Democrats, and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
"If I were to be involved in racism, I would have been expelled from America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star jokes about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in accusations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transferred, West's tirade has been uploaded through the social media of comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether the rock was trying to get its way across the West.
The West also complained to the public that he had backstage problems because of his cap.
"They've hit me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out like that with the cap."
They've beaten me up!
And then they said that I was sickened by her," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see that healthy place?", following a statement that "he would do his Superman costume, no one can tell me what I can do. You want the world to go ahead?
Trying to be a lion."
His comments brought at least twice buoys from the audience and the SNL cast looked as if it were embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person told the publication the following: "The whole studio was totally quiet."
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
The West has irritated others with the performance of the song I love it, wanting to go like a Perrier's bottle was put on.
West received support from the four-seat conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of the bravest heads: Thank you, THAT YOU HOLD THE MOB THE STERY."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just "who's there and that's absolutely wonderful."
"I choose to reward DOGEINT someone (by buying his music or clothes or his 'art') in which I want to spread a harmful ideology that my community could like to do.
He's free.
"We are too," she said.
Ahead of the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that it had changed its name, and that it would now be called "the artist formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and thus follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musical Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."

The Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacks harmful masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on screen young men often get the feeling that they have to mimic the strong man to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he wanted "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-actress Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admits that he is "quite sturdy" on the subject.
"I feel personal, quite rigid, at the moment - where did I go with the masculinity shift?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, according to the terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that the television is partly blamed for the swelling of harmful masculinity, just because of its extremely masculine characters.
He said, "What is it, and what is it?"
What do you learn on TV, and on the streets, that young men want to be the particular side of men?
I'm pretty sure that's a big deal for me, but how do I do that?
There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to make four or more sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that he has enough of "battlefields and horses."
From November onwards, it's worth seeing Kit in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor said when he saw his wife Rose's acquaintance find the evil thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in her series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played the Ygritte, the lion of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the instructions of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has reached an increase of 14%.
Health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contacts, which marked a difference.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way would have been reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the country's conservative valor, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, however, end up marrying women.
Many of these transmissions of diseases come from inadequate protection in their relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to get the problem into the grip.
The Maxine Waters demented that matuaires leaked data from GOP senators, talking about "dangerous lions" and "expiration theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denied the latest rumors, according to which a member of her matrices would have published personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislatures here on Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat has said that the allegations of "extremely right-wing" figures in websites have been celebrated.
"Lying, lying, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published information were apparently also private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information has appeared online, uploaded by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the bait line would have a line to the Waters office, and they have released information about a member of the Waters maturing companies, say the legislatures at The Hill.
"These unfounded claims are completely wrong and an absolute lie," says the Waters.
"The member of my matrices - whose identity, personal information, and security and dangers are as a result of those dishonest and false claims - has in no way anything to do with leaking this information.
"This is a completely false statement and an absolute lie."
Waters' statements quickly found criticism online, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"It's a shame," wrote the squirrel.
"He said he didn't have the right to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of having something that hasn't been eaten, then they shouldn't be rosy.
You shouldn't be defying.
Don't ask the friends of someone who's complaining and complaining.
It has to be quiet and calm."
The butcher manifested himself to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during the thunderstorm.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate worthy of challenged against the water and the midwives, also posted his opinion on Twitter.
"Wow," he said.
In this statement, the Water said that their office "informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for the application of the right about these false claims."
"We are going to make sure that your guilt comes to the sound of the day," she continued, "and that they will be held responsible for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone in every memory of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review – Little Intoxicating Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition to now look for Brexit releases in all new British films, which is not appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 and was relaunched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ironic self-satisfaction, which obviously portrays us as stupid, worth this nation's export opportunity?
Regardless, the glamorous and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his letter for the second time to cover everything up – the name of him already says enough, namely, that it is a wide-ranging comedy creation intended for non-English-speaking cinemagoers on other territories.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite having a comedic appeal for idiot-glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a stroke of Mr Bean, and a kick of that type, who added a single note to the "Chariots of Fire" lead at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
He is also actually based on the traveller and international Man of Mystery, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart TV commercials, and who left chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in the current Johnny English film.
I was thrilled by the scene where Johnny English joins a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades briefly clap against his helmet.
Atkinson's Don for Physical Comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "bottomed" and comically overflowing, especially the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible also now want to offer comedy with more conviction as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's stupid miss adventures are simply not as original and focused as Atkinson's dope-stommed sketches in the person of the bean.
The current situation is that the United Kingdom is facing serious difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret Internet network of spies in the UK, discovering the identities of all agents in the field – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop that brings the barrel to overlap for the prime minister, a pompous and embattled figure who is already involved in a total collapse of political incompetence: Emma Thompson is making his mark with this quasi Theresa May character, but there's not much in the script that could work with that one.
Here, secrets inform them that every single spy and threatens to have to bring them back from retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now employed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who, however, will be homely courses as one becomes a spy: some dear jokers here, want English to set up an Art School of Rock-wide spy school.
English has been expelled back to Whitehall for a brief briefing in Urgence and reuniting with his old-fashioned sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
The bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are all wrong again in the name of the Majesty's secret service and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's femme Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously missing a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin here Odyssey of Farce departure maneuvers: disguised as servants, they set up a French restaurant in flames; they care for chaos at Bort of Volta's luxury yacht; and the English follow some anarchy as they try to familiarize themselves with a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the house of Volta.
All the sketches are sure to be taken out for the last sequence, but so friendly and burschikos everything is, it already has something from children's television in the big part.
It's quite average.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't link to thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that suits his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain to launch a four-day week that will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan, in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the leaders of companies to return the savings they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the worker through an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend – but paid for it.
Sources say that the idea would coincide with the parties' economic agenda and also with plans to separate the country and the worker's favor.
To switch to a four-day business week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a way for workers to become the avant-garde of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy will be expected to be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth taking place overnight, but a four-day business week is an aspiration that rebalancing with the party's approach, the economy and favor of the employee, and aligns with the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to face such an idea that Green had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
However, at the moment, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considrated by the party."
Treasurer John McDonnell used the Labor Conference last week to celebrate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to seize back the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" of insured companies.
The Treasury also plans that current shareholders and water companies will not be able to recover investments here if a Labour government is certain to demand "deductions" on the basis of wrong practices.
He also confirmed plans that four-tier companies should be placed in the four-tier business line, and the so-called "inclusive ownership" fund is expected to spend 10% of the profits of private sector companies on businesses, which could then receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's inquiry could change opinions here
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a last vote in his nomination to the Supreme Court at least a week, leaving the question of whether the Bureau (FBI)'s findings could convince Republican senators to give their support names.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything new that would bring them to change their mind here.
Kennedy was more likely to work than his South Carolina workmate.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"When I came to the audience, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after this happened, this accusation came out, and really said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
But Graham's voice seems to be written in stone.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and there has to be a particularly strong accusation to change those, said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: The board vehemently contested it," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone who calls them doesn't have anything to do with them.
It's 36 years here.
I don't see anything new about the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This year's edition of the Global Citizen Festival in New York is a year-round museum that has an immensely impressive line-up of stars who are valued for appearing, but have an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attracting thousands of people at Central Park's "Great Lawn" to not only see such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to pay attention to people at the event's true goal, i.e., the end of extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the people who go to the concert need to perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as working as a volunteer, writing an email to a leader in the world, calling one or other tasks that help the goal of ending poverty.
But how much success does Global Citizen have, with only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way to demand from people that they become active or again a further case of "clicktivism" – people who would like to bring them a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million "actions" from their supporters, which are targeted at different targets.
They say the actions have helped them bring global leaders to advertise engagements and unlock policies of more than $37 billion, which will help save more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and reports coming from these shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money collected so far has had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main commitments is, among other things, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and investors committed to “helping the children harness their full potential,” and promises – after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen – to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to fight the country.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of nutrition into a foothold in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to an FAQ on the website asking, "What makes you think you can end up in extreme poverty?"
He said: "It's worth a long and hard walk - sometimes I fall and fail.
However, as all major civil law and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we feel we have success, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just some of the artists who will be performing in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The U.S. could use a navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said they would use Navy to stop Russian energy from coming to the marches, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke advised, cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the commitment of Russia and Syria – where they are opening up to the invitation to the legitimate government – would all be just a four-wall to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, they want to convey energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe him, there are always ways to go about it.
"The American states of America have the opportunity to go with our Navy to make sure that seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block to make sure that there is no energy coming on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they were ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia threaten, more or less, to exert pressure and replace fuel," he said, while in the context, Russia views it as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claim comes while the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural liquid gas to Europe to replace Russia, which is a much more likely option for European consumers.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which - if one listened to Trump - would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a few economic projects.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of impacting pressure and that it should be possible for the consumer to choose their provider," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been criticized by Germany, which has once again reaffirmed its position on the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading industry organization, has sacrificed to keep America out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "worthy" to see if she will become a presidential candidate in 2020, Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren told Samschten that she would "look good" if she went into the race for the presidency after the mid-election.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that they were convicted of running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and flick our fussy government and that means a woman at the top," she said, according to voices from The Hill.
"I'm looking forward to November 6th if I'm going to run for president and race."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he "would lead the country into a false direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren has so far been open with her criticism of Trump in his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, the Warren said: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before being selected."
There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Warren doesn't want his own opponents to be out of control in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters believe that they should not be undisputed.
Two and a half percent found it to be a good idea.
Studies have shown that there is more support there for the governor of vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-five percent of those who are there entering and eighty-five percent who are against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, to be uncontested, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enrolled in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my boss is going through, what's going through since he's back home, I can fill up with other families struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his feast as "the elephant in space" and said that their son and other veterans "return a little differently, they are tougher, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and any other members of the military, have joined."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic bodily harm against a woman, and this together in the report on general domestic violence and the possession of a weapon in the alcoholic state, said Dann Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support defiance of new asylum policy
Ten states in the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states in the district have filed a memoir "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Republican in the Grace vs. Sessions Clo, which the American Civil Liberties Union reached in August against federal politics, has not been publicly given.
She said her partners "in his violent constructions, which are gang members," they had to deal with, but U.S. officials here refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of demands for U.S. asylum come, are described as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, a lawyer general of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that the new policy "would ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum seekers be accorded the facts and circumstances of the inquiry, and such a court goes against that principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affects continue to argue in the memo that the policy would not allow immigrants to enter what would harm the U.S. economy if they were likely to become entrepreneurs, and an "important offer of jobs."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in June that judges should grant asylum to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is possible for those who leave their country because of perseverance or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or want to be members of a certain social group or political opinion," the sessions said on June 11 in its presentation of politics.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – with which people around the world deal every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled compared to the survivors
For the rest of the time, the situation was more and more hopeful.
"It feels like everything," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to calm her little pig beetle at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes in.
There is almost no clean water there."
Yours was seen returning to ruined heights here, looking through obscure properties for no matter what to save.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by earthquakes of 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulders, crashed outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being carried out due to the persistent proximity outside.
When he was told of the feeling, when it was on the 5th floor in the hotel room, which he shared with his wife and his girl to experience a brutal earthquake, he got tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been punished in the ruins of the walls, I guess," said Haris of the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming, but it was quiet.
I don't know what's going on here or with my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement that sparked the benefits of mutual US-China trade in a U.S. daily newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid advertising in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of attempting to join the November 6 congressional elections, which China opposed.
Trump's allegation that Beijing would try to get involved in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to push for China, according to a U.S. news agency Reuters.
Although it is normal to publish foreign government advertisements for commerce, Beijing and Washington are facing a disastrous commerce war, which has led to higher tariffs being charged on the other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the commerce war were thought to meet exporters states like Iowa - which support Trump's Republican party - such Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa – an important export state of agriculture to China – says that Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses as they do.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "has yet to lay down another ship by now putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
Through the spread of propaganda, the government of China opposes the beloved and long-standing tradition of freedom of speech in the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper stand at the bottom of the street of Beijing, there is little opposition voice and worth not finding a true reflection of various opinions that the Chinese could have against the economic development of their country, the media of the Chinese Communist Party wants to be controlled," he wrote.
He also said that "one of the most well-known Chinese newspapers did not want to print his article," but he did not know which one.
The Republicans are ignoring themselves by female voters before the intervening with debacle in Kavanaugh, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a counter-reaction in the intervening, especially by women.
The reactions around the subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Such things cannot be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke with The Hill for an article published a Sunday.
Reeher said that Senator Jeff Flake (R – Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation was only due to rosy voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national porte parole for the progressive group MoveOn, the Freiden, if one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Free Demonstrators, as they were called by the Senate, sang "November is coming!" while the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a Mic report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are worth extreme," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, the news site.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female "swing-wheelers", in the quarter-finals and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who - although they do not like the president - often will not be much.
Even in front of Ford's public testimonial statement, in which they submit a precise description of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could resign if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This is a confusing reflection for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican four-seat National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh is a judge, it's also a question of how Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected.
But Americans seem to have some sort of bias as to what they should believe about the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the more ludicrous.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
Plus, 38 percent say they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely ran during his statement, while only 30 percent say that's about the ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is now investigating the charges against Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford last week declared before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had abused her in drunken condition at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has exposed nominees to a party's genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to go against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that is said to be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's last project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored here and who may have access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention was behind Inrupt "the world domination."
"We've got to do it," said the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to set up their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all together on a browser, and that's ongoing.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is completely dependent on the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, manage qualifications, and appropriate themselves to become so solid that everyone can be accessed.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few matrices that work as developers on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google, whether they should or should not introduce a complete change, where all of the business models here are put on their heads overnight.
"I'm not asking for permission here."
In a post on Medium, published by Samschten, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to deliver commercial energy into an eco-system, which is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as it established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although an inrupt has been founded, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: 1st World War Paschal with "Victoria cross" celebrated
The only clergyman from the Church of England who was once a fighter during the 1st World War was a "Victoria cross" celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, he was shot by a sniper and never realized that he was awarded the highest British military rig.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "geniously symbolic" that the stone will be revealed exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, which brought him the medaille.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann conducted his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through thick nebulae and under attack on the field and by machine guns."
He later ran to the shotgun line and again led the battalion, before taking a field weapon with one hand and embracing three of the military units.
Lt Col Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his great-grandfather "never could be fair but it would be a humble experience."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also lowered a wreath after the parade, on which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band led.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be a part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine the following: You've stayed up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to get the views of the main line then refused.
There were 13 fights from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown live on Channel 5 all night in the United Kingdom.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to compete, the viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the coverage was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after remaining extra alert for the fight until the early morning hours.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government prescription that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," David Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Peppa the pig", jo.
Bellator Scott Coker's company president said they would like to revise their schedules to accommodate viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock in the morning there and we're not able to fix this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But I'll make it.
Believe me, when it was switched over, many messages were sent here and there, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix this, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a real problem.
I can assure you that this won't happen again.
We reduced the fights to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver more to the fans, but we blocked it.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has felt "many-worthy" in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he had grown up with the feeling of being inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he would not have realized until he came into secondary school that "no one is like me."
Speaking to the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that being a parent led him to be less likely to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-time show, Kristy Young, has taken a break from a few months due to a disease.
When she appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said he had the feeling of growing up "worth more" than anyone else, because "socially unaccepted was to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feelings were less and less, and the only things that gave us the strength and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "something worth," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they finally figure out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze winner at the Olympic Games is one of the best-known LGBT advocates and he took advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, calling for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was talking about this because he felt happy to be able to open and live without consequences and want to make others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that he was in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When one so young, so much persevered" - he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone who was as old as he was going through in the same heights and depths.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"When you asked me last year, everything was about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His boob has the same name as his father Robert, who passed away in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father would not have accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets for London in 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not here to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped with Ootmen and it was only when he stopped with Ootmen and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving at home at the Olympics in front of a crowd of people, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – that he played in the background, as he prepared for the Olympics and still caused a hive with him.
Desert Island Discs is set to air on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid giving it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event that takes place every 2 years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and fours a Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he did so often for the United States, the five-time lead player spent his day playing cheerleaders and working on the range of his game, hoping to improve what he plotted.
Not even at the height of his career, he was the most-rooted driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the tight lines of Le Golf National, where the long rough routined misspelled shots punished.
And if the tracks aren't scary enough, Mickelson will meet British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, forming a team with incumbent Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans with four points back start the 12 individual games have a difficult start, then Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely important.
He told his husband to trust him, but he didn't say anything.
"He fully understood his role for today, knocked me on the back, laid his arm around me, and said that he was ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the sidelines, and he's been on the sidelines this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've been thinking more about it, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really reached the peaks of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losing games and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence has brought far more unpretentious benefits to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's lazy, he's loving about others and he's a wonderful man who loves to be in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun as they were traveling with him, and also this week, which was fun to watch.
He's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a fairly large lead for the individual of the last day in the Ryder Cup can be converted very quickly and an uncomfortable ride.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it still won by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also barely," Bjorn said, after seeing the class of 2018 go on to win 10th National with 5:3 on Friday.
The story will show me and everyone in this team that this isn't over yet.
Let's do it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the british.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and we need to continue to focus on it.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Enlightened when his players hit a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
Tomorrow, we'll have another one in front of us.
It's the only thing that's going to happen tomorrow, and that's a different kind of thing.
It's great to be out with a partner when things go well, but if you're out there alone, then you'll be tested as a golfer up to the blood.
This is the message that you need to communicate to the player: Be good to yourself in the morning.
Now let your partner go back, and now he must go his way and also be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Fury himself knows both sides of those great twists, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they went off as losers, as Europe played out the "miracles of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question, as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd love to celebrate the fast start you've seen in Brookline, which you've seen in Medinah.
If the pendulum moves in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the midplayers.
"We've been trying to get people to think about how we're going to be able to do it tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the offshoot and starring Rory McIlroy in the lead, starring Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other side of the lineup.
"I've decided to do this because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
Germany's new warship has been abandoned
The latest frigate of the German navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the era of the Cold War, but it will not be completed, according to local media, due to flawed systems and increasingly large costs at least next year.
The order of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the frigate class Baden Württemberg has now been delayed, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which cites a military speech, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have reconsidered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class, which the navy had already ordered in 2007, were thought to be the origins of the aging frigates of the Bremen-class.
They have a powerful gun, a bunch of flight and ship launchers, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and battery signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible that the newest frigates do not operate at home for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove Germany’s impact and oversight – that they are already out of date, before they even challenge the service, notes “The Time”.
The F125 frigate followed by accident made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were operated by a team of almost 120 sailors – even more than half of the staff of the old frigate of the Bremen-class.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and reduces the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – will also be a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – of the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are especially important due to recent warnings that the German naval strike force is losing weight.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy "issues the appropriate ships."
The official said that the problem has worsened over time, as old ships are being bullied, but no new ships are being prepared.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flantermais
A new research, based on a plot in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how flanged mais use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the stories of the unique flight mammals and help to develop guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is commonly followed in meckeflantermais but also brown lagour and daubenton flankais in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Particularly recorders are placed on important locations around the ground to monitor the flandering activities throughout the season.
The staff of the NHS and volunteers also perform mobile recording with the help of hand detectors.
Well-founded expert analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of flanged noises and what kind of thing does.
A map and a report of the habitat are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important to the flora and how they are used by any species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of living space management work, such as the creation of wisdom and how forest areas for flanged maize and other similar species are best cultivated.
The population of flanged moustaches in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and developmental work, which affects sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Windscreens and flashes can also pose a risk, just like backpacks and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attack of house cheeses.
Flamingo isn't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching predators.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the flights of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes flangermais very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who perform regular recordings, sleep-place inspections, and Heiansdo rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated flank mausoleum reserve in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a habitat for eight out of ten flank mausoleums of Scotland.
David Thompson, the land manager, says that the land is the ideal landscape for them.
"We've got a wonderful place to be," he said.
"We have the old buildings, for the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's a lot we still don't know about flantermais, which helps the work we do here and on other foundations to better understand what they need to be able to escape."
He experienced the importance of looking for flanges before carrying out maintenance on land, because an inadvertent destruction of a single rearing living space could kill up to 400 female and young flanges and possibly eliminate a very local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to take action to help.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about flank maize and for many of our species we just don't know how it reaches their populations."
Ronaldo pleads rape allegation or his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegation against him a "false message" stating that people "want to make themselves known" by using their side name.
His lawyers want to explain to the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" who has released the wrong allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was charged with raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he had then paid $375,000 to not bring the incident to the public, the "Der Spiegel" reported on Friday.
When he spoke to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video hours after being reported on the charges, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reporters as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they are saying today is false news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
"She wanted to advertise for herself and use my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known, and they call my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a very good man and I'm a good player," he said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the "Spiegel" for the false accusations, which they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspects in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said that the player wants to demand a indemnity for "moral arbitration with a sum corresponding to the sword of violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he had, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada allegedly raped anally.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo had fallen to the knees after the apparent incident and would have told him that he would be a "good guy" to "99 percent" of that "nine percent."
Ronaldo claimed that the two had had sex, but that it had taken place with both sides of mind.
Mayorga also claimed that this had gone to the police, and that she had had photographs of his injuries shot at the hospital, but had later agreed to resolve the case <0xC3><0xA0> l'amiable, because "great fear of retaliatory measures" had been given and feared "to be publicized."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to resign, as she is still traumatized by the reported accident.
Ronaldo had just joined Real Madrid at the time of the alleged break from Manchester United and this summer he switched to a 100-million-deal with Italian Prime Minister Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will be prepared to lose its car makers forever"
The United Kingdom would "prepare it for eternity" if it were to lose its status as a world-leading carmaker, economics minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it would be "unfortunate" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"I need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that the effects of delays at the border could cost jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain falls out of the EU in late March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they will close their mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what are, according to car manufacturers, supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "manufacture-synchronous," with parts arriving every 37 minutes from warehouses both in the United Kingdom and from the EU for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be an interruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages in parts, according to the industry.
It would then be impossible for Toyota to keep a stockpile of more than a day at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus would stop production.
Mr. Clark told Theresa May their chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid cross-border checks."
"We absolutely need a deal. We want the best deal that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"The statement not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be in a position to predict what was an extremely successful phrase of supply chain."
Toyota was not able to tell how long the production would be stopped, but long-term they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting between Trump and Rosenstein will be postponed, according to the White House, possibly again
Donald Trump's inaugural meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed another week after," as the fight for candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Federal Court of Justice is still underway, White House said a Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of solar raffle officer Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible interference of the Russians in elections, investigates connections between Trump supporters in Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump is putting out the deputy justice minister or not and thus putting Mueller's independence at stake has been the number one topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about being discouraged, recording talks with Trump, and about the possibility of deposing the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
But the other day, he went to the White House, and according to reports, he was able to get in there.
A meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "get out" Rosenstein, but he was allowed to meet to avoid overlap with the dismantling of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, whom he accused of close sexual misconduct, all both expelled.
On Friday, Trump demanded an FBI investigation of a week of allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There has not yet been a date set for it, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to give it up a week later, with all the other things left in the Eternal Federal Court.
But I'm still looking forward to it, and I'm always keeping the press up to date."
Some reporters have questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a press information round of the White House since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace has spoken out.
Sanders felt that the lack of information loopholes was not caused by an aversion to television reporters, which turned out to be "effect-hash-up," even though she admitted: "I do not dispute the fact that they are acting effect-hash-up."
She said she would be in direct contact with Trump in the press.
"The president holds more R&D meetings or like any president in front of him," she said, adding with no evidence, "we have looked at those numbers."
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, then it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen that we've done a lot in the past few weeks, and that will replace a press release in the future when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly asks if he is leaving the White House or attending open meetings or attending press conferences.
The press conferences are on their own.
In New York this week, the president may have proved why, by making a lavish and possibly bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health calls on EU employees at the NHS Scotland because of Brexit fear
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff of Scottish NHS (State Health Service), expressing the country's gratitude and wishing that they remain even after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to take over the cost of an application for a regulated status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal have gone ahead and are heading towards expected decisions for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has to be a time for all of you.
That's why I now want to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, from which the patients and the communities we care about benefit.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay."
Criticism of Christion Abercrombie's head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie had a no-stop operation after a head injury at the 31:27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores a Saturday, the Tennesseaer's Mike Organ reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened shortly before half-time.
"He's been on the road and he's gone," he said.
The trainees and medical staff welcomed Abercrombie's oxygen on the sidelines and laid him on a beer and brought him down for a further assessment.
An Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there will be "no details about the nature/extensiveness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a college athlete in the 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax if they buy a foundation piece in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a landfill in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory Plan to help the homeless.
The step neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to attract young voters
The taxpayer is responsible for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The finance ministry experts expect to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp costs if they buy a landfill in the United Kingdom, using the additional tax under the Tory Plan to help the homeless, Theresa May announces today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attract young voters with promises, make more viable housing moves, and target well-deserved earners.
The stamp tax increase is imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money strengthens the government's fight against sleeping on the street.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels that were introduced two years ago on second home seats and coffee-for-the-loan houses – could amount to up to three percent.
Financial experts expect the step to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased from non-United Kingdom citizens, which drives prices into the air and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to catch foot in residential construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become "spiritual" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new directive comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help younger people own their first home.
He accused large building contractors of keeping land prices high, by buying land, but not using it, and he urged Mme. May to give up quotas on affordable homes, in order to raise "residential pollution" of Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a striking drop in housing reform proposals, including paychecks and an end to forced evictions "without aggravation".
He also wants to give the community more powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would use my term as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for anyone new generation.
And that's what it means to fix the wrinkle.
Great Britain is always open to people who live here, work and want to build a life.
It may not be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to buy homes like British beer.
For too many people, the dream of home is too far away and the threat of sleep on the road remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland CEO Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become sometime manager of Scotland.
Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reliving the North-East club, which is just in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He entered the Stadium of Light this summer, after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland) in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up when I was a kid with my father watching a lot of games from Scotland in Hampden and that's something that has always drawn me back.
I'll have to wait until I get to the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he is not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, during which he previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I was asked, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself to be successful if I could return to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to take over from the downhill to the third league and transform St Mirren from the downhill candidate to the championship title winner in the following season.
Ross says he now feels more likely than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a true divorce path," he recalls, as he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was right for me to play even more.
It sounds strange, but I've beaten well, been able to live well and enjoyed some well-founded highlights.
But play can make sense.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure through the work, but the management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it feels like the best I've done in my entire life as an adult."

The perfect time for a pint is according to a study Sunday at 5:30
The heat of the summer increased the rates of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups experienced an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but revenues and restaurants declined 4.8 percent, as evidenced by the numbers.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, who carried the numbers together, said: "Unlasting sunshine and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when pubs had 2.8 per cent more turnover than pubs.
The decline of 1.8 percent in June's restoration continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars in which they were drunk were far more severely cut off than the restaurants in Abode.
The food and beverages were also eaten under the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to drink.
In all pubs and bars, food sales went up by 6.6 percent in that month, with food being three percent down."
Paul Newman of the leisure and hotel industry analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the out-of-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a sales break of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the persistent cost pressure that is particularly high.
The long extremely hot summer couldn't have come a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August are bringing so urgently expected Otempaus."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in brand new openings.

One out of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One of five children – part of which is just 11 – has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, which hides them from their parents and school teachers
The survey of under 20,000 secondary school children has revealed a rise in "false Insta" pages
The news prompted the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed their parents
One of five children – part of which is just 11 – creates social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of less than 20,000 secondary school children revealed a rapid rise in "false Insta" accounts – an application on the photo-free Instagram site.
The news sparked the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would run a "main account" that they would show their parents while they also had a private one.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out: "raped me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which would have admitted to operating private accounts.
HMC's Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "speaker of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Association at the Annual General Meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has seen the move as a significant opportunity for those who start the sport to benefit from her broader experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the light athletics community of all of Scotland, the United Kingdom and all over the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we had to take the lead," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm happy to be acting as a linguist for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter run at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and owns a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "I've had a hit a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only over time, it turns out, whether and to what degree I'm recovering.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to go again and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for the sampling!"
Advertisement for milk pumps, which compares mother to cow, reaches the middle of the online
A company for milk pumps has online with an advertisement that compares stinging mothers with cows that are struck, reaching the middle.
For the introduction of the so-called "first worldwide inconspicuous portable milk pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released an unimportant music-video-inspired advertisement to promote the freedom that mothers – who pump milk – with the new pump.
Four real moms dance in a hey-filled cool to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I strike myself, but you don't see a tail" and "For the case that you didn't notice it, these are not ears that they are my breast."
The choir continues, "Pomps of, pomps of, I feed my babies, pomps of, pomps of, I strike my ladies."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video triggered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it fuels the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad idea to use this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, with the exception that their children will be removed a few days after birth," he wrote.
The milk pump Elvie fits discreetly in the stem sauces (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Indeed, traumatic for the mother as well as for the baby.
"Why don't they use it as a way to get a baby to take care of their children?"
Another one said, "That's a good sign."
Others defended the advertisement, while a mother admitted that she found the song "importantly strange."
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one if I still had to.
By the way, I felt like I was a squirrel.
It's a bit crazy, but I've seen it as it seems.
"It's a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement that targets mothers who are pumping off (often on their work or the toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they were all dancing with the discrete pumps placed in their suitcases.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's puppet, however, is very unobtrusive, has no wear and tear and fits discreetly in a saucepan and offers women the freedom to move around, keep their baby and even go out while pumping off.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother" commented: "The Poem of Elvie is a revolutionary product that deserves a keen and provocative introduction.
While drawing a parallel, between pumping mothers and milk, we wanted to elevate the pumping of milk and the related challenges and at the same time demonstrate in a entertaining and tangible way.
This isn't the first time Elvis's headline has been made.
During London Fashion Week, a two-time mom for designer Marta Jakubowski ran across the catwalk while wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrants succumbed to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of imprisoned migrant children has reached a high level, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's sharp rhetoric and the guidelines introduced by them have forced it to include children in sponsorships.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of their own chance to stay in the country, put on the game, and they agreed to adopt a child.
The risk rose in June, when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their state would have to drop fingerprints, and that dates would be shared with the immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, informed Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children from people who had volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been pre-sanctioned before.
"Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large part of whom are criminal foreigners.
"I'm going to follow the people," said Mr. Albence.
When trying to get the children to work faster, officials, according to business associates, introduced new rules, causing some of them to appear before the court within a month after the ceremony, rather than after 60 days (the previous standard).
A lot of people use video conferencing to prescribe their case for legal status as an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for help will be expelled quickly.
As children stay in detention for longer, it is more likely that they will become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to accommodation employees and reports reported from the system in the last few months.
Prosecutors have stated that these concerns are still exacerbated in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs, based on the facility's size, are believed to be fighting a child with it.
They have added that the abandonment of children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could still worsen the trauma they are struggling with.
Syria demands that the U.S., France and Turkey withdraw their "occupation" immediately
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been undermined for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also vice-premier, said that the foreign forces were illegally detained on Syrian soil with the pretext of counter-terrorism and "accordingly detained with them."
"We need to get back on track," he told the council.
Al-Moualem has insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as over," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus is continuing its "holy struggle until we have cleaned up all Syrian areas" by terrorist groups as well as "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, al-Moualem said the conditions for them to be in line to return and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have joined the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"It's a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel high mountain Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, admitted that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, to the sights that "be eliminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and establish the way for elections.
Al-Moualem put conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the Council should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election, except for how many liberal viewers are likely to hope to end an inauguration or a scandal his presidency would be prematurely.
It was "the most dramatic end of a presidency that ever happened."
So far, however, there are no signs of scrutiny.
Since 2014, the quotas at CNN's main broadcasting times have doubled to 1.05 million more than and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million main broadcast time viewers, four years ago it was still 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the cable rate with no less than 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that's upsetting people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an aging comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
He recalled a taxi fare in Boston before the whale in 2016.
The man told him that he was going to go for the Lord Trump.
"Why? he asked.
He replied, "He's going to make me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
It's a mess in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the actions of the White House could lead to the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigration families come together again and determine the health of the global economy.
This is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it transcends the understanding of an informed citizen, when one gets his own six-hour-long debate, looking at a panel discussion of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background," which depicts the source for his book "Fear" and the "thrown-down" of Paul Manafort's "thrown-down" post-the-book "the-book" (the-book) of the year, "the-year-daydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydaydayday

"Part of what he's doing makes it feel like a reality show is that he's giving something to someone every night," said Brent Montgomery, director-general of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show with rotating line-up and indeed unexpected conspiracies (when he meets the next generation).

It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flow of money, thanks to the reorientation of the congressional districts, which received two officeholders in a race around the same seat.
This recent new suburban district of Pittsburg is to the detriment of Democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a solar whale last spring and another district.
Lamb is in opposition to another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which crosses with the new 17th.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old counties were constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race around the new 17th saw a sweeping exchange of campaign funding between the main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania after a scarce victory in a much-observed solar eclipse in March.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points ahead.
Politicians have given the Democrats a light lead.
The U.S. has tried to impose sanctions on El Salvador for China's support, but it has
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much opposition from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners left the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nair, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only criminal measures against El Salvador were tested, which in 2017 received about 140 million dollars in U.S. aid, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishment measures, which cut financial aid payments and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rate.
With the progress made at internal meetings, North and Central America's leaders have made a high-level conference with a focus on security and economic well-being, in order to join a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to attract migrants.
But in mid-September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be preceded and thus effectively offered all considerations for punishment measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence must now host the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the import that the administration is setting for the meetings, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys have returned very quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new news or clashes from Washington.
A representative spokesperson of the White House for Mr. Bolton has refused to give a comment on the details of the debate by the three American Houses, including two diplomats who have agreed to discuss the internal considerations regarding the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
The Story of Learning
Your next job message could be the Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible right-hand restraint, on which there is now considerable evidence in the public dossier.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also wants to find out with his investigation into Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be reassembled, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility before the new composition, shortly before he has to show himself again the electorate, and possibly even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European equivalents.
We must all make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to start a coup against Hitler, if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and have not taken the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that have arisen.
The course of history is turning around such turning points, in which democracy's merciless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who steers the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a hectic situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he took the president home and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the report of The Times is flawed.
"What will our response be if Brett Kavanaugh's newly demanded F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual superiority and dishonest statements against him?
And, first and foremost, are we going to vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't do this, we're going to have a tough time with democracy.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers host Rapid Vienna and Donetsk are aware that the victory against the Austrians, after playing impressively equally against Villarreal at the beginning of this month in Spain, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury caused midfielder Graham Dorrans to hold off his first game of the season since playing 2-2 match with Villarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use this result as a spring bride to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we got something and they went home with a point.
Perhaps we would have known about it in the end, but, in general, a gambling game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were the better in the second half.
It's a big European night again.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything that happened to me with my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels right now.
The squad is good and the boys all have a lot of fun; the training is good.
We hope to be able to move forward and be successful in the last season."

Even though participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be provided, few people talk to members of their family about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said that they were going to talk to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known early enough.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help to find a way to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover costs or a self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died during a severe earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian state of Palu the Free, so the Houses, with the expectation that the number of dead will still rise.
Since the communication possibilities have collapsed, the official aid could not obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, which is at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th birthday when earthquakes and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300km (180 miles) off the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel cultivation is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have often been hit by tsunami in the last 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian disaster recovery agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalam Lake killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the midst of a seismic fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 force hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 strong earthquake struck one of the Menawai islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial tide struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the deadly tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by failing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The area has destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaksa and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for accusations of aggression.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been charged with soup<0xC3><0xA7>on of domestic violence, allegations of domestic violence, and resistance to a festival, according to a report released by a Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the suspected crimes, he took him off the phone.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unsecured debt of $500, reports KTUU.
He was a samshden before the court, where he declared that a "very certainly not guilty," as a post-debt confession was asked, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A fines, which means he could go to jail for a year and get a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class-B offense, punishable by a roof in prison and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the suspected attack.
The case is currently in front of Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was arrested for domestic violence, allegedly reporting a domestic violence crime, and for possession of a gun while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His friend said that he had hit his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for seeing his son's violent behavior and connection with PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-strong earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of dead will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck a bit away from the center of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on the social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Want Rare Death Penalty for NYC Terror Attack Suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a runaway home depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway and Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who were in his way overrun in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "wanted" to kill eight people and "wanted" to cause serious physical harm, according to the Memorandum of Understanding to demand the death penalty, submitted by the Southern District of New York.
The two charges can lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court filing.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury sued Saipov for 22 charges, which included eight murder charges in aid of protection money extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "important plans and foresight," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "greasy, terrible and perishable."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pain, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnacco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York pursued a death penalty case for the last time.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug-dealers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of espionage to the Soviet Union for two years prior during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 at the Electric Stull.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack, court dossier according to.
He told the investigator that he was feeling good about what he was doing, the police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching an ISIS video on his cell phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was not guilty of filing 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal compulsory defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to envisage the death penalty will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone, rather than a confession of debt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to consider the death penalty.
Tory MEP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today at a Tory conference that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "save the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced to bring back the deep separate ranks has been targeted by pro-remain goals that have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has had problems with their Chequers compromise plans to keep Brexiteers on track in the EU.
Allies have insisted that he should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the setbacks – and force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose either his package or ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he wanted to get the Chequers out.
He suggested that the Lord Farage should have been given a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was going to die, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to get the chequers out."
To make clear his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, and the journalists said, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not choose for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and lead us to be elected at all.
"When I'm gone, I'm going to let the chequers fall and start listening."
In a note to May's mother, it added: "The premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must "save the heat" if they go ahead with the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between the people, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'they won't let you down.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic public, he added: "I want our political class, which is shortly before Brexit, to leave the heat.
"We are mobilizing this country's popular army that has given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
During that time, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists have rounded up after the founding of the group this weekend Tories Against Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis joked with the Conservatives about the security problems they had with a party app as the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know how to install the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
The president's plan is to become a candidate for the presidential election.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, "seriously looking to become a presidential candidate"
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat de Samsden spoke about her future during a speech in the city hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP State Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It was the center of speculation that was going against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in the city hall format since Trump took up his post.
A member of the group has asked for the presidency to be elected.
The Warren responded that it would be time "for women to go to Washington to oust our futile government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
It came to an end after a deadly shooting of LSU Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, have announced a Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in relation to the deadly shooting against basketball player Wayde Sims a Freedman.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help identifying the man who is seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247sports.
Wayde went in to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot, with a weapon, and admitted that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without a four-command warrant and was arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, has played 32 games last season with 10 starts and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is more familiar with the World Championship title after the team's success gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It has become clear that the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the Saturdays ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took out Hamilton while defending his position in the first two tier and invited Vettel to attack his player.
Vettel was the first to go to the pits and led Hamilton to drive the traffic at the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went on to tour the pits afterwards and was behind the vettel as it came out, but Hamilton came first after a bike-to-wheel action, as the Ferrari driver had to unintentionally release the tires and still risked losing to defend the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first tour on his 21st birthday.
He was then for a majority of the race the first while keeping his tires to a quick conclusion and to take over Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went to the pits on the 44th tour but he was not able to raise his rhythm in the last eight animals, while the Raikkonen were given the fourth place.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a one-two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a mockery at a rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "bad and decent and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that was going on during the last few days in the Senate, when one sees the riot, when one sees people who are rose and evil and decent and dishonest," he said.
"When someone looks at what's being done and leaked, they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Reminds me of his response... you've leaked the document - 2 oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't lick.
Oh, wait a moment.
"No, we didn't," he said, squeezing his voice.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein disputed that he knew the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as I asked."
But his resignation did not arrive well with the president, who during the rally commented on a sampling: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continued to nominate his defense from the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, continues, suggesting that Democrats use the claims for their own purposes.
"They want to restore the power with all the means necessary.
It sees the evil, the equality, it's them no matter who they like, how they have to overcome in order to gain power and control," Mediaite reports as saying by the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars suffered for the loss in the Elite League the freed up against the Belfast Giants by winning the back match 5-3 in Dundee a shilling.
The Giants were early ahead with two goals scored by Strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to balance before the Giants returned due to the Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard scored two goals for Dundee before winning two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a Friday night.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants won the three matches before.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull Assist, with David Rutherford giving the Assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a challenging initial period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 to the game before Matt Marquardt reached Cownie's balance at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take a lead in the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to the same level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he made sure they won with his team on their fifth in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match.
It's a way to make sure that hundreds of people on the plane are able to escape from an earthquake.
A flight attendant in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while wanting to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people on it comes safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi island, triggering a tsunami.
There is a lot of space in the area, and many people are trapped in the streets of the city.
But despite his workmates fleeing to save her life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the wildly shaky control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the slope at the time, could safely fly away.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision probably saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
Sea prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear it," he said.
While the agencies fear that the number of deaths could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to rise, as many bodies are still under the tumbler while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that were up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a solar mass funeral is held.
The military and traffickers help and provide.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance body.
The water is scarce.
The mini-markets have been crowded everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I pray you all to work day and night to complete your tasks within the framework of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok at the beginning of this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crashed: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one man has disappeared after previously being told that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to sink.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they have not been able to stand up for a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats have helped save other passengers and crew after the plane came up on the water as it was trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The police said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers would remain in hospital one Saturday, and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact outcome of the accident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the slope.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane had gone over the pier.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was in a deep state.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others had managed to wade through the water that went up to the heaps, until the safety exits on the plane that was going down with it.
He said the stewardess had panicked and shouted that he had suffered a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked close to improving a shipyard also helped rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to land before the plane went under in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to data from the flight safety network, 111 people have died in accidents by PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them have been in connection with Air Niugini.
Analyst traced the time span of the night and cost a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a Saturday's explanation of her case in a second investigation of a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett, of the Department of Justice, has stated that he is an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retraced for the jury as a cell phone donor used to co-host the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night it died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many cell phone operators who showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting his statements of otherwise, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sandford.
Sandford expelled a samsung, claiming that he had not been on the roof in the city.
When the investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck the night before, Sandford said he was going to lie "because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inadequacy was that Tellis said he had known the Chambers for about two weeks when it died.
Mobile phones have shown that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone after Chambers' death.
"He's lost his life," he said.
It is planned that the defense of a sun begins to give its final arguments.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later on.
The High Breed What is Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that the hip hop has gone from its origins of political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become popular again in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
After a blackout?!
New York City's children's couple accused of being fired after a "racist" text message
A New York child girl sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed text message from her mother complaining that it was "after a black man."
The couple argues that they are racist, and compares the plaintiffs to "extortion"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when it found out that the new childcare company, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived for its first day of work in 2016.
"Never mind," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to his husband, she sent it to Mamma Maurice, two times.
After noticing the Fauxpas, an "unwelcome" Plasco flaxman dismissed Madam Maurice, explaining that the child girl had just gone, performed an African-American, poor job, and that instead of expecting a Filipino, she was reported to the New York Post.
Mother Maurice was paid for her one day's work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses the couple of getting a compensation for the discharge, and expects a compensation of about $350 per day for the job of 6 months for which it would have lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, something like that doesn't happen," said one fretted the post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple objected to the allegations that they were racist, refusing to say that it was the reasonable decision to cancel Maurice's attitude, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said the man, Joel Plasco, in the post.
Are you going to put your children in the hands of someone with whom you've been angry, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Dajee."
Plasco said while comparing the complaints to "extortion" that his wife had only given birth to a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there such a thing as a slingshot?
This is not a good way to act," the investment banker added.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, smashing them for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington publishers were afraid that the readers could not relate to a beer that spoke to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of one who celebrates the first reading before it is published.
It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy beer to write the children's book, would have been rose if his work had not been accepted, and added that the 60th birthday of the books would have been "battery" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes it as a "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a very calm man, and he wasn't a person who was hurting himself," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like someone had a know-how to achieve that something: it's one really proud of them even if it's not his own work.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in the direction.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter and Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital were brought to Nice, where the doctors tried to save his life without success.
"Nad has often called to say that it looks very bad, that there is no expectation that it will be packed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I was called by Nad to say that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm at it.
I'm going to get the sense.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart on the slugs slowly and slowly declined and left his system.
It was a short time ago and that was just the end.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation with family and people.
“I’m going to rap my ass.”
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who is currently in mourning for the loss of her daughter, had to climb into the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what to do.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've got my head down, and the tears have fallen all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the curse I felt a huge sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved.
Women in mourning send cards to prevent suicides
Two women who loved them because of suicide have worked to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support for, for example, a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm feeling," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an eye-catching grin.
"Everyone knew him because of his grin.
"They've always said that they're going to make room no matter what."
But he left his job before he died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his sibling after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly making sure that this is going to happen."
Mrs. Davis made the map, "to tell people notice that there are people out there who can go and talk to someone, even if they're a friend.
Just sit on the floor, you have to talk.”
Madame Humphreys, who has been friends with Madame Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that there was something different going on.
It was Christmas time, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
It said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to agree with it: "It raps a laugh throughout the whole family.
It's pulling us out.
We all have to fight and fight.
If you have any difficulties to agree, you can call the Samaritans for free at 116 123 (UK and Ireland), send an email to <0x40>samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance while the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what we asked for - a time-limited investigation, with limited scope - we could possibly achieve a little unity," Mr Flake said, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "fall out of the way."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your timeline is completely in line with the time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans get poor results, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and the highest court in the country elected.
George W. Bush took the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 elections in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to pass a pardon and take him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'fails' to accept Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-sug cited data from the Ministry of Association in the south and said it had 1,127 survivors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and major costs of human smugglers play a major role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
In the end, the majority of the survivors from the north will be offered a South Korean statehood.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which technically still sees war against each other – has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks about the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has imposed sanctions on the United States for the lack of prosecution.
"Without confidence in the U.S.A. there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances it will be impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he would not be in his temper to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comments to the Saturdays in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said in a Thursday about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh claimed that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were both emotionally contested.
During his interview statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly cheering or swallowing while dealing with his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "great and coordinated reputation killing campaign" organized by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh had demonstrated his statements that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in his way he hated the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed concerns about whether it would attempt to sue Kavanaugh if he was sworn in, and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying that here - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only appropriate to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in court where he's right," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is seen as a conservative justice.
Kavanaugh was asked about the possibility that he would face certain Supreme Court decisions, going out of the way.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
The woman has to do it.
It's a fair hesitation, months and years of anger that flooded, and didn't get it out without crying.
"We're going to have to cry when we're gone," she said, about 45 years ago.
"I don't think that's wrong, don't you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leadership force somewhere, where she said that she would also cry if she was rose, but that she would develop a technique, which means that if she becomes rose and starts crying because she will cry, then I would go to the person with expensive she says, "You think a lot,
I'm a rose."
And then it just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Grains are partially allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my hardest memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I screamed deeply with indescribable anger, was that an elderly woman took me to Kolli – a cold manager I was always a bit afraid of – and pulled me into a trap.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is.
"You're sad and happy that you've got it."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an outrageous affair on a boat called Monkey Business and went out of course, Ms. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that there should be no further thought about the idea of becoming a presidential candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another one.
It was called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was already late in the campaign, it was behind the donation-gathering, so it swore that it would not go into the course unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, gave him just $250.
"How much do I have to pay for it?" he asked.
As it held its speech and announced that there was no formal campaign going on, it was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had been supporting it, frustration with the system that makes it so difficult to collect money and to target voters and not delegates, and anger against sexism - that it was losing him.
"Someone might think I've had a nervous breakdown," the mother-in-law recalled about her reaction to the press.
"It was thought to be my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on my grave.
Was he screaming?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first salvage of the trade war between the US and China has made one swoon, and even if the fight is not over yet, a break between the countries could be long-term beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has fired the first warnings at the beginning of this year by taxing important Chinese exports, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end half of the goods coming from China and the US were taxed.
Beijing has rebuffed every time, and has recently set tariffs at five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that it will join the U.S.'s shot-for-shot, and the world's second-largest economy won't push in as quickly as possible.
If they were to get Washington to stop doing so, they would have to respond to demands, but publicly small-scale action in front of the US would be too great a blamage for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the pressure from the US in the trade war could be positively supported in the long term because it would make the integration of the two economies smaller.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic swirl in the two countries is ultimately much more dangerous than speculators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Think Tank Center of New American that focuses on Asia.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it would be ready for the refugees who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would be better.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met to ensure that those refugees who want to return to the country and who have to flee due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their living conditions can return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are 6 million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that they did not accept any service or assistance from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated Team USA with a result of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the crown back as the Danish captain's team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the bulk of the tournament's problems, shot his tea shot into the water on par-3 of the 16th laugh, thus losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all of his rounds, and has been 1 of 4 players who have each had a 5-0-0 since the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was named 5&4 of the worst player on the European team's rankings, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-placed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 in 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most wins of all time.
"I don't normally cry my skin.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he took me with him and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get back to the quilt.
It's going to be the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He will be the father of his country's cole, John Ram, who defeated US Legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game a Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I looked at him as I grew up," the 23-year-old said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
US captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they've fought.
There were times when we were celebrating Europe.
We've fought.
Chapeau for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll be back, I'll be talking to the PGA of America in our Ryder Cup committee and we'll continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your courage.
We have been overwhelmed."
