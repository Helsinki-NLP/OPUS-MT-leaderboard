Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older city hall traffic light.
Two installations so close together: intention or shield-bourgeois coup?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach’s mayor yesterday.
"The city hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially commissioned yesterday, was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to be used for their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is simply a priority here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the crossroads Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when selecting the location of the traffic light masts: "With the help of a van loaded especially for us with particularly long wooden logs, we figured out whether these vehicles can travel from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the traffic light mast".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is “the most modern thing currently on the market,” explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights can be clearly seen by the drivers, for example, even in low sunshine.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“Should a group or disabled people go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think along here as a partner and observe the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle roared through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood – speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize-winner is best known as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at St. Peter's Square, Gerhard Fresacher compiles a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichem, belauernd seine Familie" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisite: a crisp sofa on which is supposedly copied and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the textual material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a wealth of directorial incidences, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, their head submerged under water, their evening robes on the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stalk on dangerously high poles through the staging, either monologue loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the exaggerated performance come to a halt, and Winkler’s absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every mile travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres traveled – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while one cannot agree on an action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only going to use potentially,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who is planning a record of the miles traveled on all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
In America, however, there is no longer as much fuel as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
At high fuel prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, for example, because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system in developing strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally enshrined goals of the state on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for the distance covered.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, had called on Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, representing people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities nevertheless move in this direction on their own.
Oregon currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to track the miles traveled, but not exactly when and where.
Khan said the public would be more reassuring.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not enter to help states with the taxation of motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance where drivers should pay based on the miles traveled.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average mileage traveled by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxable device that can also be used to pay parking fees, to pay insurance only for miles traveled, and to collect real-time speed data from other vehicles, which allows drivers to avoid congestion.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is sufficient,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
King's Field: Small team beats themselves wacker
The volunteer fire brigade coped with its autumn main rehearsal with bravo despite staff shortages.
Only 11 people participated in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his acceptance of his practice.
A short-circuit is said to have arisen there during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr prepared themselves to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first releasing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an overhead hydrant about 100 meters away.
Now three releasing attempts could be made.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what can be achieved with little available staff during the exercise.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided by the Königsfeld Daily Operations Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he, together with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parent council chairmen, investigated this important question.
“Education is an important location factor,” emphasised Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the Berufsschulzentrum in Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase around caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also stated that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills often the regional economy is preserved, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places are offered, the need for skilled workers can also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced on his rail trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
“Stay persistent and make sure that public transport gets better,” he explained to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then a vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is before the renovation, will once again be placed on the refurbishment cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed in the first works of the renovation of the front school courtyard to stabilize and statically relieve the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the next step is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
Afterwards, a cost calculation will be carried out by experts, which will then be placed on the table to the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure to rehabilitate the necessary boundary wall from the ground up and to put it on a new substructure.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, need for rehabilitation and has a bow inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fastening works.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was even planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall refurbishment, which has already been used for filming, will be mentioned by the Landesdenkmalamt.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The students of the Bräunling elementary school, who are now taught again in a well-restored old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also been involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz site in Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who is regarded in Stuttgart as the favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is forcing a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, among other things, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” for drug smuggling.
The more than 500-metre tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig under the radar,” said U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Speaking to the drug gangs, Duffy reassured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime in Mexico.
Constructed by experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three men face life imprisonment as a maximum penalty, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug discovery DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed about the detainees, at least one being Mexican, it said.
You must expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first record mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary year is about to begin.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together in 794 documents.
In churches, a certificate was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently does not have a hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses.
Church-houses will be the 1250th in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the turn of the Black Forest Club, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it should not only be a chronicle of geisings themselves, but a printed work about the geisings of today, which consists of geisings, church houses, leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s geising celebrates 2014’s birthday, and in 1974 the current space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
Strohglonki Fools’ Guild of Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a tradition evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has a banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was then a court of law.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in his hands.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety at railway crossings should be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they have to participate with a third of the costs, the rest are shared by the railroad and the federal government.
Schiltach's urban builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth there west of the railway track.
There, larger vehicles, for example those that transport longwood, could also be on counter-traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for a road spread: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, summed up the sentiment of critics: "Should we take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the Kuhbach area will be partially transported over this route, because the up to 20-metre-long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argued Haas.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the costs of the planned widening of the road investigated.
In spite of this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the proviso that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter traffic to about 5.5 meters if necessary.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could cause longer vehicles to be seated.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending worked in the current state of development, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because the stop point in the middle, to which there is a good visual connection, is located directly next to it.
Even trains from the main station would have to be decelerated at this point to the extent that no collision threatens.
The majority of the approval was denied for the conversion of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bade out" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been reached.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on some of them at least, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will drive research forward.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now been narrowly chosen.
Numerous committees are examining the proposals, working with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, ESA has selected four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, initiated in 2007, should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To investigate this question, the Space Telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be investigated in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to provide information on the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to launch in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa is planning the first of the three total L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is set to investigate the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter, which consists of stars, planets, and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerated.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-Mission here, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-Mission.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission foresees a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
Unlike systems on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals still compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
Proposals have already been eliminated, among other things, on sample return transport from Mars, on the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and on solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice indictment includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has intercepted the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the intelligence parliamentary committee, said that one should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is to testify in Germany, then he needs a guarantee that he is “safe” there, according to the MP.
Snowden said in his letter that he saw himself exposed to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
He was, however, touched by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers wishing to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday reads that passengers are allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies for hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it calculated $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid first at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second piece of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have therefore put as much as possible in their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to bring a piece of luggage free of charge at the frontier gate, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they could get to the gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far left the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand luggage fees three years ago, and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline, followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth crunches and handy discussions at the gate.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as if it were lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit at the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had followed up.
Frontier’s move to charge hand luggage fees if passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the mileage was reduced to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party carrier with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore bring customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenues decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier’s finances as part of the company’s sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the Protestant church in Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall was "sayings from the Bible" and "reflections from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the Bible proverbs after breakfast in a lecture.
“Words contain life wisdom, regulations, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like, "Be watchful, like scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone, the Lord gives him in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners on what proverb it was.
The phrases from the Middle Ages were adopted by the church councillor Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, haying something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger was also involved.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled tourists
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as untrained in the industry will be qualified to become specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained specialists, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA declares an “internal mistake” and not hackers are to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and this is still unavailable for some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not at risk, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency, is now in the bright light of the public and is facing sharp criticism after the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data released and stolen by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the office of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have reacted with attitudes.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, healthcare and elderly care".
As a result of the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industries have also been received since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Losses in Bombardier’s earnings after decline in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter and contract issues in the railroad business.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious schedule next September.
So far, only three more launches have followed the test aircraft’s maiden flight a month and a half ago, making it questionable whether the test phase is as planned.
The results were below forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in view of the fact that the stock has a limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker aircraft delivery figures were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series will catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
“The test plane hasn’t stayed on the ground any longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates had been scheduled during the aircraft’s service life.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we also did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it over the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight tests – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, of $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and dropped from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport business amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase from December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to the management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, Bombardier's share fell by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 after it was also announced that Google's Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would move to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport executive told Twitter via the short message service that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, according to several media reports.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would cry and children would cry.
There was panic among the waiters, many of them hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveller told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA has suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
Afterwards, he was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television images were shown, as numerous ambulances and police cars drove in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building to safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special mission command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which led to long backstops, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes were also seen on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is served mainly by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss of police investigation, must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, shares information with Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug lord of a major police investigation for fear that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "first-class" lawyer nicknamed "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a barroom dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of home searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals for fear that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of impediment to justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough made regular calls to Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests discovered class A drugs in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the “secret of attorney.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office both at his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has too much engagement with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing, claiming, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I’m not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, I would do it right away.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta undermined this trust and tried to hide behind the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial disability, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison for conspiring to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the Evening Mass at St. Martin’s Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10:15 a.m. during the service at St. John’s Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Sacred Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair will be presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism deviates from increasing confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism about the new is hesitant but increasingly a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six committees with the chief ministers of the pastoral care team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of trustees in which the parish priest Kraft Amt is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called community teams are formed locally in the six parishes.
Your task in the future will be to promote church life in the place.
When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parishes, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations stipulate that accumulated funds in the parishes will be retained as intended.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the general community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," relativized Haslachs parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" in 2006 and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then went on to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafting will be clarified at further meetings and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Plullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Plullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, the managing director of the municipal utilities, told SÜDKURIER, an additional four-member family costs between 70 and 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This surcharge is fixed each year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These calculate the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can levy by a surcharge above the electricity price.
The municipal utilities of Plullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now, the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number going to be closer to the 2 cents.
Lights on Permanent Red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you want to do with red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic lights is to be assumed.
Anyone who continues the trip despite the red lights, however, must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate themselves less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
City Council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been aware of debts since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the financial statements for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, with around 1.8 million euros, is also about one million euros above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The wealth budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher inflow from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
Since fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned, the input of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You can't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the council members were obviously pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens a lot.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, however, subsidies from the country have been cut several times, according to Gerster.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various balancing poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investments are in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s story at the Men’s Singing Club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbfest, in the context of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the now probably more than beloved choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, among others as a member of the committee for 28 years.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoralreferent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate from the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival was in the usual tracks: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To honor their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Federal Song".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folks "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, abducted to foreign countries, while the "impulse choir" also relied on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to local areas, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children occupied the lunch well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the Zollernalbkreis are being mailed these days.
The Schwarzwälder Bote, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the nursery need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and cr<0xC3><0xA8>ches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a building or embellishment request for your facility, you can apply with this to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner has to take care of many diligent construction helpers himself.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask oneself: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, “actually takes the media into a stranglehold”, whereas The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered “a heavy blow” and labelled the draft as “draconian”.
The passing of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media was infuriated by the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “although a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s “living blogosphere” according to its description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do impunity whatever they want.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
The Kenyan legislatures have already in the past attracted public anger.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission, and put back into effect their substantial salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – they are among the world’s highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose any importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, just like so many speakers.
Wet therefore also became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
Above all, his thanks were directed to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who participated.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
15 years ago, the first considerations were made to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about creating an artificial turf sports field, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago, when the FC took over the shelf in inheritance lease, promised a cost share of 100,000 euros for the construction of the site and the country approved grants of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros in total costs of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meters large artificial turf site began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used to build a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on domestic and judicial issues.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentary bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, it is likely to be about the topic of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the topic of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD backed up its no to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive,” SPD negotiator Florian Pronold said in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasion on country roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronolds’ point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was traveling with her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath around 9.15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she oversaw the 37-year-old’s approaching car.
The driving toe collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damages occurred, the police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Such announcements will no longer be made at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
Much of the loudspeaker announcements are eliminated - the noise level should thus be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of announcements that affect individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, among others, are already refraining from the noisy calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls are made by the speakers in one day - should make it quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed aeroplanes or departure times are also a bit lost here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling brake cars with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabish on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter to the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should skip over once and then just come to lie down.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away, a plock is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in a Schottenrock.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "Outfit" the jury will award a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival site on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the Burmese wind music from Schömberg is organizing the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays polka and marches.
Her repertoire, however, also includes sensitive waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen will be among the gutters, known as the singing host and black sausage baron.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and the Fools' Guild.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early kicks, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf will start on Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday, there will also be the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsman's market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw jumping castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
For example, pureed tofu with plant cream is a quark substitute.
The Federation of Vegetarians calls it World Vegetable Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Injectable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students of the Black Forest High School got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, we went over the financial center around Wall Street to the September 11 Memorial.
On the third day, students from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, we went through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday schooling at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
According to the legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge.
The Jagdhorn-Bläsergruppe of the Jagdreiter Westfalen, under the direction of Brigitte Kluth, performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The redesigned cover shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the lexicon, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay with the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but always recurringly experienceable.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A glimpse into the inner life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café at the Opschlag: In Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the top, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience.
And last but not least, the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
After all, the port festival was rather outside - Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that’s why Daniel Büttner is not a keen fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it all right.”
And with an event, I always only address those who are interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
In other words: Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opslag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many people, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastro area and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thank You at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubroom of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence entirely in the name of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is also always the right festivity to perform honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but you also made many rounds for us, for this we thank you very much," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals were given this year to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Artur Brückner finished fifth.
The board of directors addressed a special thank you to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at his regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club room.
"New singing-pleasing voices are always welcome," Schlotmann said.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Goals
The United Nations is now embarking on a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process that aims to achieve universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not shy away from any effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball top league.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how such a win tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained many players in the A-Jugend.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, we have to wait and see if there will be any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Especially in the cover work and the switchover game, it was a huge failure.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of Mozambique and first president, to voice peace calls during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s independence square.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by White-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have left foreign investors and locals worried.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US into the country.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about an instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “loser” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo quit the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are collapsing their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is imminent when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out rioting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga reluctantly responded to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” he said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about the corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life”, according to one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools”, which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic,” children would be “totally shut down” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “subliminally” conveyed.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, through which history is revealed and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scenery.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged leaps in time from youth to the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his open yard.
And then began the scene play in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
In style he performed with the two-span and "Schwarzwälder Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly well-versed in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous lives in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor to grant him the honor of becoming an honorary citizen, who, in the representation of the then incumbent Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
The three-king singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh how beautiful, there will again youth memories of my own three-king age come alive".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church in the same way as his concerns about the outgrowths in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the home ground, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
There was a lot of applause and many praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of remaining in the league of the sportingly retired Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not apply for a possible rectangle.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license,” Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
Until now, however, the Rhinelanders were denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the final instance.
Haigerloch: Evening Meal Church is coming to the fore
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its public themed guided tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Evening Meal Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the sacramental painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous model of Milan by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the half-hour guided tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spying affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it said.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Second place went to Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher reached the bronze staircase.
At late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake the successful end of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program for a colourful children’s and family celebration with numerous participation activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for every age is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or cycles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running, also promise fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour through the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, each at 12 and 2 p.m.
On a ground walk, children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who is driving his scraper pack from 11 am with the museum guests.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is enjoying a pleasant and fairytale atmosphere.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o’clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 am.
Furthermore, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders during their traditional work on both days from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable chew, because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not able to deviate from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by boat to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Shrill beeping disturbs locals
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the barn.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue pile and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the handlers, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
“The signals serve for safety and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In case of unfavourable wind, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the lawsuits very seriously and therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre deep lounger in front of the terminal, cape-size bull carriers can also be handled here.
“This year, we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark in the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketball player optimistic despite first loss
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe that we will win against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
In their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichs sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point gap 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish champion Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has expanded, as recently as at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline’s stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they were too familiar to perform at a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy charity event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slick fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-themed W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival’s biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'm living here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiation Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran is pleased with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrades with Machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the youngster, who had taken them with him, was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called among other things a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
The pimp has to go to jail
Because of exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
Accordingly, in five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent out after a few weeks against their will.
Resistance he used to break with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women who worked for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented women from contacting the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partly monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first complaint by means of telephone surveillance measures.
The interrupted talks were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, had not made any statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this metric.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He has disbanded from these circles and wants to live a normal life after being detained," he said.
Oil price continues to rise to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report saying China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen late in the morning in Europe in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents on the ICE Exchange in London to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the stop-and-frisk program (“Stop and Browse”) of the New York Police Department, and released the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for stopping and questioning persons is implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the demanded suspension.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after being checked by the police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded during the term of mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men who belonged to all minorities, which developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police presidencies implement the regulation.
Opponents are of the opinion that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; also, money would be wasted and the wider problem of a policeman who is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implements the controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hände".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable successes.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous surgeries on several trips on site.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act in an advisory role at the association.
In 2008, the carpentry company Schleih from Baiersbronn created the infirmary in Socogim, a misery district on the outskirts of the capital - volunteering in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political turmoil in the country, you could not take as many trips as planned, but for this many physicians came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers containing material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided ample local colour by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat’s stable and describing the experiences of the musicians from Stammheim, who traditionally support the association, during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motivations, he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel emphasized that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than many think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to review a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and track Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“According to the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people’s homes and hoping to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to research stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, “And if he knew about it.”
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editors when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
In the time of the search, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had faced Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks disagree to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go on the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Paris <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The other side was also hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be continued, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matchdays in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December thus fall out.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the Citizens' Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants came to the community hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and contribute ideas.
Häußler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flooding that hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a drastic event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up lands as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The basis is the planning of protection against a flood expected statistically every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect state subsidies of about 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the community relies on the participation of citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retaining basins were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one is required to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Discomfort prevailed among residents of the old town, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have to suffer from overloading the canal network over and over again.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be coped with.
Dimensioning the sewers larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but at first could say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily jammed that the fire department took almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
The two men were sent to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a god-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly, the relationship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky is to be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusions and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read themselves like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood early on that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, exuding the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, which is terrifyingly similar to ours, mutants are looking into the future – and the police are approaching.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," the chief of the agency said.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, we have a penal camp full of pesudover breakers."
They assume that bad things are happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's wiretap.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does he make mistakes and sacrifices, but he builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth over and over again.
Speech about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spying affair around Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier yesterday, the Greens parliamentarian Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA Reveals Intensify Company Paranoia Over State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use opportunities of foreign espionage to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his fill horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new level due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been messed up, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then certainly corporate management is also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there was no evidence to date that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“That’s not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
All except the IT industry.
Nonetheless, the range and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the US jurisdiction and is therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, after the revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s like: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate governance usually does not boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, as this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick with them at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the Board of Management at Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BBT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorized access,” the BBT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can take," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They were important suppliers around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has taken its toll again.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The dresses, which are often ruffled and embroidered, are closed at the front, often with a veil, but at the back they go down their backs and often end up in a train.
However, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes, the ghosts separate.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of the location is important, it was explained.
Jewelleryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to drive the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Cuts are also popular for boy's party," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
For the second time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it at number twelve with 87 points.
Susi Höpp took the critical look of the performance judge with her Woody in class 1.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found in an upright mat behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium on January 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff's Investigation Officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth’s lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it lacks any logic, violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Her son went to school to study and came back in the corpse,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of “position-related suffocation.”
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues to how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for the management of children’s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand’s auto-injection is most commonly used – to counteract a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third sex for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but can indicate "undefined" or "undefined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgeries for sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born every year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovarian or testicle) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend that you use the best available sex assignment information if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of an "undefined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
Gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But by now, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they don’t know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they’re assigned to.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was formable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses – such as parenting a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a punctured circumcision to completely castrate the child and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex surgeries have appeared to the public who are “not happy with the outcome.”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors were not clear on whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and let his breasts be removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law can “encourage to stamp and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an ‘undefined’,” she said.
We fear that this will facilitate interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law “authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatric assistant.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions in a hurry," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush to do an operation that can't be reversed anymore.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents around because they think they’re not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown Injure Girl by Shot From Car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when he was shot from a car.
The perpetrators probably fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air-pressure weapon.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police investigated, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg residues, no material damage is likely to have occurred.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were probably also ignited in the urban area, but no material damage has occurred here too.
A local resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his bicycle trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man has found his bicycle trim panels in the immediate vicinity all again, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a Future Perspective
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus surgery, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book by her has been published on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today at the age of fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them displace it as long as they can.
“Always get old, just the others,” she says smilingly.
Only when the suffering pressure is really great do you think.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
"What kind of home you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the local language, you can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to those who are willing to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner’s apartment.
In old age everyone has their ticks and quirks
'For me, such a dwelling would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,” Ries said.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior living community can still work.
However, this has to be different than in the classic student WC.
And sometimes you just want his peace,' she believes.
With this opinion, she is not alone in the state capital at least.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Their department advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends to all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their home or apartment, to first thoroughly inform themselves and not to hire the first best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment according to the age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much larger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it grieves her more than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. to continue prosecution of Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He was also accused of unauthorised disclosure of secret information.
That’s why he has to face criminal proceedings in the U.S., U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Snowden’s recent statements would not change that either.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s remarks were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence covert Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
The former NSA employee sought by the US has made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
According to a translation published by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To those responsible
I was asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contract or a direct job as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials — including the United States — have assessed the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear, while at the same time the risks taken into account have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a fidelity breach and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political opinion.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in responsibly clarifying the facts of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and lawfully.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten on Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the Municipal Council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
There were 100,000 euros in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the bar at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician's shock.
Report: Obama campaign considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and she reported Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by campaign and White House leaders, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the poll scores of swapping former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House senior adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
“Double Down” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “close personal relationship” before finally deciding against such a move after data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible poll scores at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “provided care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes.
“Campaigns don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing of the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Maybe," replied Martin.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to conventional mail?
When designing early internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for a reliable exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the mail to their service provider’s mail server.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional emails being read along the way through the web?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorised people reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading along?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes, according to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother in the woods scarred and pensioned
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and nursing allowance.
In order to continue collecting pensions and nursing allowances, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigations by police in the forest.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he deleted the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat from them.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
When consumed, the ice cream reacts with the tongue, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights up – the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and of itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball-Verbandsliga after six days of play.
The team from Ingo Ehlers will be heading tomorrow to the derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers said optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his complete squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is playing at a pace.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left nothing but a safe impression in the last place.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite, because everything can happen in the derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to settle in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windsuß, who is active with double play law at the A-Youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, irritating inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of “hot dogs”.
When it comes to sweets, we are not squeaky.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who move through the neighborhoods with the phrase "sweet or sour."
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is sugar-sweet candy corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
Nothing is more part of Halloween than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't get rid of them again, and then leave a comment to the guy you're standing on like "nice facial expression."
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve made from an early age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921-pound pumpkin.
Residential fire in Helmbrechts: Rescuers hold charred corpse
The fire brigade had to migrate to Helmbrechts on late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
Rescuers carry a charred corpse out of the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether this is a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already blown out of a window.
The emergency personnel went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible pastoral deficiency: The Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a pastor on a full-time basis to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of desecration: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can focus on where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for it.
These are the young people of today who are not only interested in careers, but also in a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree start their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an achievable path to world-class events.
We are delighted to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the toughness and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called for the rescue of a dog trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable location
Firefighters roped off on rock wall and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre-high protrusion in a rocky wall.
The nine-month-old cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and posted help calls on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who ran his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the spot and roped off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby was very lucky.”
There was a chance that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
Firefighters have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she ate dinner with the old dryer, and that "he dredged me when I was 18."
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made attempts to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed at number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a prerequisite for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-backed border along the Hadrian’s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually, not a story.
And one that has come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties gain ground that are EU-hostile or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to gain almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives enacted by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage fixes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is on the rise, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle that could be used to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe down its own economic policy, which is what the troubled French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election and thus referred the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I want to go: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (finally) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can put where.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European alliance, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly-thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and keeping our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to blame.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now opt for independence, only to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is now fast,” Kaplowitz explained.
Clear indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair as well as body odor, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the occurrence of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is “early” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a boost in growth before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is made faster, tests by an endocronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and repelling another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medication, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her days when she was ten.
Even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls used to.
Kaplowitz believes that the most persuasive premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, marking the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the one that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The fight comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated by the new “mini-jumbo” design.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" will hold 406 people in tourist-class seats over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share flaws about technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus now appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant squeezed together, with the title, “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats closer than regional turbo props,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly christened “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been conducted that show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’s figures on seat dimensions, saying it is not at the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it’s becoming increasingly an issue that can impact sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat from the 777,” said Mary Kirby, expert in cabin setup, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape size to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to blur, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Stop Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Human tests require further trials, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market, but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to contain genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker not to experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “pause,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if absolutely certain, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, that smokers would use it to quit.
“Then they know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any pleasure about the nicotine vaccine anymore, and that helps them get rid of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption authorities.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules for maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three lands on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operate two restaurants and a café, without renewing tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, it is being investigated for the allegation that Tripodi had known of Obeid’s covert interest in the plots, after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he declined to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a restructuring of the government’s lease rules.
An ICAC phone record showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” replied Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missile shipments to Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "realty test"
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion that would prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the move of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Strong statements like ‘foreigners should be at the back’ and ‘Australian first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region take an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who spent yesterday on talks about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the "reality criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the proprietor or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially only wanted to support a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker presumably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England from the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unmistakably” campaign for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection holds the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigative report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at launch and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to ease the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode”.
Passengers are already allowed during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a ton of work, but are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"Casa currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
The subject is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about an expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, stating that it is open to changes, but that they need to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after now offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it would stick to the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices must not be used when launching and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision will vary depending on the age of the fleet for US companies.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile radio interference, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced the consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost ghostly acoustic that the viewer offered himself until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans were heard with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented themselves at first exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint incitement, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the stand a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the court as always as the first BVB player, briefly cheered.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but by no means everywhere.
There was nothing wrong in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune.
Norbert Dickel, a spokesman for the stadium, once again summed up the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a festive mood.
Only five minutes before the kick-off the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which until then was almost tangible with hands, was released in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, inquired about the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Lastly, as always, it was the South Tribune's turn - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came with a whistle from the south stand, everything was as usual again.
The previous silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was picked up late due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from performing a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade it,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to opt for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
We can’t wait to see how the reactions on the South Tribune will turn out.
Pawn houses are booming in Singapore as the middle class crisis has arrived
In a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (approximately 1,730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, this week became the third pawn shop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singapore’s liens demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent demanded by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
That’s why millions of people in the region turn to lien houses after families feel the pressure from rising cost of living, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawn houses to make up for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city’s 200 pawn houses are gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai lien operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the lien business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with its IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnhouses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly raise the debt.
“Customers borrow items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household education,” she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawns are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, earning up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
“This includes wealthy people borrowing for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to the presentation of the Green Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German public prosecutor’s office or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Australian bailout package over $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the state’s government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million of emergency assistance for electoral benefits.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinicians have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive funds from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state’s public health system off the worry list,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman for the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "plaster solution".
“We are in today’s position because the Labor State government has withdrawn $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government is tearing almost half a billion dollars out of the system, and the Commonwealth is putting 300 million into it and then pretending to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier cost than necessary.
Playing in France in the 1760s, the plot tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips into lust or sensation – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tortured penitentiary shirt for the audience.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Possibility to Produce Chemical Weapons, According to a Surveillance Group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gitting gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, the global chemical weapons surveillance group said on Thursday, while there have been serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date
1 November, which the The Hague-based organization had set Damascus to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits here, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fights underscore the danger the chemical weapons inspectors face, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time amidst a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the major production and mixing/filling facilities named by Syria and their destruction.”
“There are currently no further inspection activities planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites listed by Damascus.
Due to safety concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had “been abandoned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there were moved to other mentioned facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat off to the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director General of the Surveillance Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Rage over sentence for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angry at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried, as Umar Patek was expected to be shot by law.
Patek, who had been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
There was also a conviction in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as the “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bomb builder.
The decision has awoken painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators caused nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when a massive bomb exploded shortly after 11 p.m. in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a explosive-filled backpack exploded.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He escaped almost a decade of arrest, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He hasn’t stood up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is being held at commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but don’t have cell phone calls)
Passengers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not make phone calls on their phones, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the aircraft personnel and the regulations for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices,” the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not restart it until the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn it off again and must not restart it until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like guardians on this issue.
Nevertheless, internet connections for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers continued to be prohibited, the agency explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmission masts," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies have mentioned that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966 after reports of disruption of navigation and communication devices by passenger-driven FM radios became known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they don’t care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you scroll around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the proponents of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the interference with the devices is genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots speaking for disrupting aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA that pilots be allowed to order the passengers to turn off the equipment in case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea Drilling Island re-released
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water raft was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water skewer was probably a winter-like migratory bird from Northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added: "He couldn't fly any further, which is why we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water ridge was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, roughly representing the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing as EU states stagnate.
They want government to favor new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than sticking to the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be restored to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as companies said the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with this, which is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means increased attention to trade for companies and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller calls Bulgaria’s pipeline the start of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official site.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic data are correct and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial properties are, the view on the transaction volume shows, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer an attractive rate of interest,” said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with child-related sexual offences before being charged in Caringbah in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had “never been involved in an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization”.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which one sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of the abuse of his confidant children.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission’s assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that “there had been external reviews of the YMCA recognizing the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had “failed down from me” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes committed against twelve boys during his two-year YMCA work.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, made them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior Lord was and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable.”
The managing director said he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare said he had informed the YMCA NSW board of directors that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not about employee reporting” and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by YMCA’s managing director of child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that was "over zealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, to the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training, training and oversight of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Middle East Peacemaker Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When the Horse Show experts came to Cardiff to pick the Horse of the Year, they knew there was a tough competition ahead.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who isn’t even in kindergarten yet and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee sprinted loosely through the three laps and took the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in handling the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has since practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field and went off the pitch with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Total strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, "The whole audience was like electrified, and everyone cheered and clattered at him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” look – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed their part to it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed” after appeal
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation, should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a sub-state company.
The New Express is now undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "correction order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disordered,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license.
The Yangcheng Evening News Group has also been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant managers of the New Express be identified and that the management team of the New Express be reviewed immediately.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion, as did the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to review the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug trafficking tunnels between the US and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the court records.
Three men working as drivers, according to the authorities, have been charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and a lifetime in the event of a conviction.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has said he wants to break up with his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly the way we plan or hope for it."
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these gourmets are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhaus, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Also Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
Born in New Zealand, he has been vegan for 13 years. In Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday matters are also possible without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says, expressing the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, but an enrichment." The assumption that one reduces the choice of food options with the dietary change is more likely to attribute Proctor to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some well-meaning attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor writes in a comparison.
And say, "Those tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste delicious.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are excellent, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegan simus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on pastures, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the fridge," Proctor says.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of consuming the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
All I need is on site.
I only buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that just the finished products are expensive, but that's what it is known to be with "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can get good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamism, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor said.
And more precisely, the everyday world then does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
French fries are everywhere!
"Many canning shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are getting along so slowly.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough requests, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor states.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Particularly if one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can be contained as colorants, one quickly seems to leave the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not only why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are enclosed in food and cleaning products.
"Secondly, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes consciousness.
He may not quite manage to abandon his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the air.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures with the stock market operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
Initially, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive incorrect purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators took almost a full day to view and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading came to a standstill due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the Securities and Exchange Commission later determined, and diluted the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Constance: Radler moves 63-year-olds
The accident had occurred, according to police, when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was traveling in an improper way on a ladies' bike on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the sidewalk from a local, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went down to the ground in the further course and drew a 15-centimeter-long wound to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police give Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been sent an “invitation to face up” asking him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens to extradite to Sweden for a sexual offense after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we choose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty before the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments in the 2012 budget, which cost over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the income from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the tax year 2012/13, exceeds the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system.”
“However, this move could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of buying real estate in London, or stop owners from selling,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on how a dog’s tail-sweeping relates to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs swayed more to the right with the tail (from the dog’s point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain halves respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail-sweeping of their fellow species, the researchers monitored the animals as these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tendency of the tail was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the swinging with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his ‘tail’ is rolling to the left rather than to the right rather than getting restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to him, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” said Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer suffers from laryngeal inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band’s announcement came after they had previously postponed an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to November 21 at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets will remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is the case for a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be scheduled," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals is likely to have decreased by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote again amounts to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “well possible” for Francis to ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat backrest
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Vehicle Safety Directives for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the message read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in hopes that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not apologise for Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 election campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during the turbulent second year of my medical studies.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential election memoirs.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took a speech away.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen stopped to point out the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced seclusion of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the blockade tactic of party politics has tilted too many aspirations to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I’ve come to the end with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans’ private lives and why whistleblowers are being punished who disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House’s efforts to pacify the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could be contrary to the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP’s office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unfermented alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval levels falling to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the harder due to this book.
It awakens within me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put in a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision, he told his employees to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mountain tree agnate, who is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the allegation when he wanted to wipe questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to cancel or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would benefit personally from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared a 53-vote lead after the re-counting to be the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you invade, enter the data into a computer, choose immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, matching with pencils is unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new position “very seriously”.
A public office is about public service.
“We are not seeking any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, including two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, confirmed that they are working with authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion a day will change ownership.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that entails the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former merchant to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been expelled from his current position as European leader of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was suspended this week, and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks’ trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of banks' own internal platforms leads to "the ability to influence the market even with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” said Credit Suisse.
Painting the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the disintegrated house in the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had arranged the embellishment campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" was attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative very much in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
Speaking to many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be much better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying these responses further, the BI says.
As you can hear, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow in the civil decision.
Some seem almost frightened because of this, others feel they are a “plumping extortion attempt” on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow Kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangnick’s criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which an alleged acting act became fatal to the Senegalese – which, of course, was none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A very bad decision," Rangnick said, referring to referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, given the success course, Rangnick tuned a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: Really good," he said.
There's not a lot of exposure.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep this going.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It’s a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opted against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held that the health law stipulates that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been resolutely rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of a century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" exclaimed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers set up sun loungers, others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby summit in winter with a cable car.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million kroner project (around 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has given the Italian alpine resort of Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post barely learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still at various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP says.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
Whether it will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the response to the FDP’s request.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially for appointment mail.
"This thins out this company radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters on January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals’ Group and City Council, supports his group colleague: “What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are secretly changed or also deleted.”
The post office is miles away from citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But to his knowledge, there is also a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatization.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city’s magistrate is consulting this morning on a presentation by traffic department Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fee should be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is “a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller specialist retailers”.
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Surprise Host
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The seniors were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudenstädter, even because of their age.
With the hard and placed imprints, the Gönningers were extremely hard on themselves.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played cleanly by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the center of the net and were not on the spot in the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all respects.
In the face of this crushing and game-defining achievement, the third set was then won a bit sluggish and lustlessly to the 3-0 final (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which was clearly able to prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a highly competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and point gifts, especially in ball acceptance; even with the passes the precision was sometimes inadequate and in some critical game scenes the over zeal prevented the view for possible point gains.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut off on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the gorge, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Government Bureau explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness is covered with the aim of preserving the now heavily grown old Allmendweide field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting it to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to preserve the species.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to what was achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various remarks, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, and the forest tractor was ready to be called up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a clear view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal buildings can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate for the successor of mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for office for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11 at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, has filed lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outlawed by him in Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that aligns search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patent.
Google has increased its offerings several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outlawed by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar demands a high level of damages from Google, as it claims Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Egypt pledges first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes office, but his day of triumph may not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, which has its seat on the Nile and is modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the US and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been targeted by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
Spotted as an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to achieve the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in a habacht position.
The military leader, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest lecture hall with speech choirs of "The Army and the People are a Hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers taken over by the military council from the head of state who had been chased out of office.
But with the official oath being taken before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque for two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: severely injured
When replacing a defective outside probe, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating probe on the exterior facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning on the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg State Hospital.
Rape in South Africa: Two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator has been sentenced to twice life sentence on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had provoked horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the youngsters was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of fact.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64,000 sexual violence reports every year.
That’s almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure for sexual violence 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right from the start: The most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at a quick meal in Waldshut
"Here I am working huge quantities," the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product, marvel.
16,000 colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television at a level?
Also details such as the Ph value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm looking forward to seeing you guys measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," Jumbo cynically said.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the clogs continues to be manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fires visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Fir branches here in the smoke ensure the special taste of the black forest ham.
After 20 days in smoke, the ham is almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star.
All those involved will be able to live with it.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the full year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, that means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million over the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made eight percent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start into the second half, particularly in the Australian and UK private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way to record yearly earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings carriers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, equating a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers spend less here too.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so earnings for the full year are expected for the third consecutive year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the auditing supervisory authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public trust,” emphasizing that the GCSEs would become “challenging, more ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum will focus more on "problems from real life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes will be presented this weekend in the town hall.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is organizing this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations in the Soest district show their best animals as well as young wicker hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open for all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola with stately property prices and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new Bubikopf.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on today's handling of the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant Churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If in the past centuries people had known too much about it and had put on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is more distinguished by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope has been properly expelled by the criticism of religion,” the speaker says.
She has provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have disappeared.”
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is connected with the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything may be well."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Klein Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the ceremony
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
The church service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si in the morning, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Sacrament of the Firm, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the firmlings had prepared themselves for the great feast day.
In different projects they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to master the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the Illmensee sports club.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, there were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German Championships.
These two were able to set off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team Nightmare who made it to the top of the winning staircase.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A gratifying development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race even more absolute top athletes were at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to set themselves apart from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl was already twice world champion in twelve-hour driving together with a teammate.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, the final lash came in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only a second behind, the routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle Brings Free Medical Assistance to Remote Villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States, the relationship is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer in Bwelle ripened the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive the tightened medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are received like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and his limitless energy – is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team will start examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
You come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for their neighbor.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is supplied by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous chorus, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery of a groin fracture he received now allows him to work again.
“This is changing my family’s future,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s going to sleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteers in Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in operations where we help pat blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s without a doubt a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his métier, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago in fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, which the fisherman boy Manolo is talking about.
When Santiago sits tired of life bent on the chair, that’s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solo actor for a long time.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which, with her songs and her magnificent voice, sings the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters long, a sewage canal from Roman times is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers rise to the sky and make it the second-highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers suspect that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts very unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," Schulze says.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore, from the remains of the old city walls, only that which was not too large stood still.
Most of the users of the car park now also rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you look more closely, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in the D2 parking deck.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of hand-plate-sized stones.
"These are remnants of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look in a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft on the upper level of the park.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman law and city of Agrippa, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at around 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
However, there will be a few more years until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They were said to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor's office accuses them of having inflicted and beaten three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One of them is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about territorial battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice repealed the judgment after revision of the public prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the district court for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
The beginning was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in Tatnacht.
As a witness, the commissioner who was investigating was invited.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
Difficult is that rockers almost always adhere to a law that is rather for them – and not to testify.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor’s Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
There are 11 further days of negotiation for the trial.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point we went home.
Only: in the bellies of the people in the front passenger seat and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than chilling to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little thing?
I admit, I like to be with you when it is late at night or early in the morning at the fast food hole.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers are noticeable.
After all, what do you need to do to constantly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and on parking lots.
“Why?”, I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paper stuff is messing up the landscape.
Bags have also already concealed traffic facilities such as guardrails and caused accidents.
But not thinking about what that "throwaway society" means, it probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after spent nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are piling up there.
There would be a few bags more or less nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities are getting away too stupid - and the fast food chains have to ask for a deposit for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retraction yesterday in his often repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After receiving hundreds of thousands of letters of notice from their insurer, the Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the denunciations, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re getting a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans directly that they deserve better,” Sebelius said in a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an advisor sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the Affordable Care Act’s “architect” did not voluntarily renounce state-sponsored insurance to sign a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government fails to confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday told the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter jets attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcasters Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been bombed on Thursday night from Wednesday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official saying he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said, “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, in part successfully, attempted to supply ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would follow a military response.
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry declares that US spying has gone “inappropriately too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the US’s defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that espionage had gone “inappropriately too far” in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11.
He subsequently became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone inappropriately too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be impaired in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. in anti-terror efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to the frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his agency was preparing the congressional trip to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans' rights, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is waiting for an assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six hits.
After all, the Mainzers already have to renounce the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having devised the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“Of course, we’re very worried, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a bail of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is on vacation in the resort Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court had heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may have made an effort to improve its devastated tourist image, and there is therefore an acquittal.
