Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lacking will in the peace process.
The Obama-promoted deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans to the U.S. Congress, which was partly regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the then-imminent election in Israel.
In an emergency call, professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the cell phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police hugged him.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get an idea of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
Gautier police, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little agitated and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parental home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," Hairston, now 40, said, living in Brandon's Jackson suburb.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a low-lighted bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first-semester seminary program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight commemoration on Tuesday evening, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamm referred to Prentiss as his wife in his emergency call, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 workers still employed during the 2014 Christmas season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice the seat next to me is empty, and it’s gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary “Back in Time.”
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I'm a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back for the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "undoubtedly the biggest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France – on the fringes of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in meeting the crisis in Syria in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll scores that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some begin to seriously question what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s perseverance and are starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some recent survey scores that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthused” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they’d be “annoyed” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they’re “enthused” vs. 40 percent saying the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “enraged” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Despite this, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively run his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temper doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinions.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just a little more than half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the mind.
46% said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a focal point in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll, they’d rather be a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square metre of a thatched house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student office in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany’s top places of residence, however, one of the prices is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, well noted.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch kettle of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third start.
Müller received friendly support from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto at his 28th goal in the Champions League to lead Bayern, who let a shot of the world champion, intended as a flank, pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised 31,688 hot-blooded fans before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium - and the Munichs kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed notion without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, unbeaten in seven European Cup matches with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely ran, but often too unimaginative to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were initiated too often by a game shift to left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank struck from the right half-field in the left upper torch.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
The best opportunity in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown struck the pole's header off the line (26).
Then by direct take, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to make needle stitches.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, however, was relied on.
Like when he directed a shot of Ideye over the lattice (56.).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a chain of four defenders with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training, sports board member Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "If you want to make something different from it, that's already vicious."
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by penalty Müller put another on it.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly disguised Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured transported from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news is that the risk drops quickly if you give up.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIFE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking, however, could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take over ten years for the threat to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpinned the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists at the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for archaeological soil preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman has been injured at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
At around 1.40 a.m. on early Wednesday morning, the woman coming from the station building crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she has suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated with emergency medical attention on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigators have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman’s crossing at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Local residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided at the Federal Police Hotline, which is open 24 hours a day and free of charge, on phone 0800/6888000 or any other police department.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To alleviate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
The Swedes intend to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures provide concretely for the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow opposition to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS), which is mainly required by large corporations, is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, override national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was criticized above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account important points in the reform, which Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked out in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the lawsuits of the economy by too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be in place by the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be non-sustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost overwhelmed by Steven’s lecture.
On the basis of various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, he tells about what his minutely and delicately arranged songs tell.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative fool.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a bold series: Each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens performs here.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a widely acclaimed masterpiece appears in 2005.
Exceeding ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any yearly list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Long since emerged from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decor.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theater, the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now banned from sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays themselves through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "more opulent" and you can thus "throw away the plate basically".
Only to an addition, Stevens thanks himself modestly, plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bows down under roaring applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Hour has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is expected to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time and to join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-determined questions shortly after noon, with his performance probably being examined by the media and by the Labour MPs up close.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesperson for Mr. Corbyn said he had “stand in respectful silence” and he had “recognised the Royal Air Force’s heroism in the air battle around England.”
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in business, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacking” within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn’s comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is presenting amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron over the past decade, since he has been Tory’s chief executive.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s question hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “fighting skill” and arguing with barbs, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He has also raised the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he has addressed John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater" that is often linked to the Prime Minister's question hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the prime minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shooted in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living from it.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply according to data indicating an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom, while the SABMiller bid target increased the FTSE 100.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest and fastest rate of interest rate rise since 2009.
The pound rose more than 1% from the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% from the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after taking over offer from rival AB InBev.
One transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the Richemont luxury goods competition group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are again showing growth.
Glencore’s shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said it had made $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating for Rating to “sell”.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six-month period.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a handcuff with top-fashioned haircut.
The type with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is spinning.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here lives her idol, whose posters hang up in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs as much a day as her mommy Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to be in high school in the tenth grade."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream."
Compulsory schooling?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Neither did Bieber.
He took care of it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowl’s advertising break, he cashed three million, and a two-year deal with an anti-pick company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter, Bieber also cashes in.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Doner Idea
Potatoes or donuts?
Both can be done – in the potato dunker developed by the Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer, filled with meat and potatoes, has been spinning in his shop.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese with the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a utility model, according to the authority.
How much meat and how many potatoes the skewer contains, Alhay therefore does not want to reveal.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches grounding campaign to combat Aldi incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grounding campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and appliances implements its annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA retail stores, generating higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away sales from all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and the volumes on Metcash’s high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s sales in the food and food business to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and to reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass’ comments.
But it's assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and is investing more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, improving IGA retailers in improving their stores with fast-growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive Ian Morrice says price adjustments and store refurbishment programs will increase at Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis Supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", was spotlighted by Kyrgios' notorious engagement with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen crushing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost in the U.S. Open because of a cramp, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too severely.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixture."
"First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the limelight, in which he can only think about it, I think it's best for him, and I think it's appropriate for him to be the team.
Europe’s refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency, shutting down the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, and detained all those who tried to illegally enter the country, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man’s land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian stand-by police.
Some rejected food and water out of protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There will be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, at the end of next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that EU states would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country – after ending a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also lay down higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovac told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers carrying vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security adviser to Orban, said that authorities found 45 people while trying to cross the border, 15 others had already invaded the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed wire train had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pressed a crowd to push themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary election (58% earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, receives support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most democratic voters say it’s too early to say that their opinion is certain which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have diminished.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party.
One quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
6% would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the selectability are also cited.
As the vice president puts a potential for presidential office on the scale, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race – even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters of the primary are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second election far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that number dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers him to be the most "selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results on some important features among voters of their party’s primary elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best among the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Pre-election Democratic voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn’t affected her opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this matter was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on Clinton’s general opinions, although 36 percent said her opinion of her had deteriorated.
It’s mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters across the country also view Trump as not being honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as being honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson closes up behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times’ latest poll
The two candidates now account for half of voter support in the new poll, and others dramatically lose hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, growing support from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well-received among demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been knocked down with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls – he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even though peaks are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing holidaymakers to still find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go into the sea anymore: the water in the North and Baltic Seas has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Almost two years after a student passed away during a bullying ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with his eyes closed, and repeatedly attacked while attempting to approach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment, and at least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the rate of interest will be shaken, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, U.S. Central Bank representatives have stressed so strongly that investors should focus not on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an interest rate increase.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money'," Julian Jessop, chief economics officer at Capital Economics, said in a statement.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal highs, but still to low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency to choke off asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happened after the Fed raised interest rates.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been in the uptrend - about 14 percent - on its way to an interest rate increase, quite flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment firm Barge.
Deutsche Bank said the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could speed up a recession.
It is extremely noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point with a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only doubled nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of “whether it’s different this time,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a Fed interest rate increase all year round, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all of the 1950-to-day increase cycles took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession heights very quickly in the shade after the onset of recovery," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields drop immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds coming closer together, leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we’re still careful to expect higher yields,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says, the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have expanded, and volatility has increased — all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies operating most of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will get worse as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debts.
“History shows that “quality” stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "dumbing"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of parliament and increasing new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something the private broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was “dumb” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 doesn't seem - I don't like to use the word 'dumb' - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I’m learning from Radio 3, I’m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is truly unsurpassed.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is also really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that harder work must be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports for kicking the commercial rival on the feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show—with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges—was produced “in a special BBC way.”
He added that he hoped the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of other series of The Voice in the future, or to spend the fee payers’ money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased slowest in August, and Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000, up only five percent from the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the city centres.
Muslims Buried Killed in Mecca Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partially blames the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-store group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the track to show their respect when the first of the dead embarked on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying ones.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the bin Laden family for the catastrophe that left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beggars who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-owned Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-speaking service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management was prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statements about the collapse of the Krans and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also denounced the group for not current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's deceased leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amidst strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rial (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured people receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can skilfully handle a hammer or brush for painting walls, you seem to be a minority these days.
Because Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer low-priced services is now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shop purchase decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the men are predominant among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this closer to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of women’s purchase decisions.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that employs exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and revenues after the group scolded the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation had revealed that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial crimes.
Judge Michaela Sanin, chairman of the Senate of the Schöffensenat, dismissed this fact.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
To the disregard of the infidelity, the defence demonstrated that the association had never created an asset disadvantage at any time.
The sports officials would have only offset expense compensation and deducted the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money, from the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 shillings (approximately 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or do we lock it up?" one of the defendants, a bread-professional large-scale auditor at the tax office, told us.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We’ve shot up money, put our life insurance policies down at the bank as a security,” he said.
It was agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, with appropriate financial success, the payment of expenditure compensation had been decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, part of the expense compensation was paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits also appeared, the former manager explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, the only important thing was the freedom of debt, according to the answer.
In 2011, when one official began an investigation into abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club’s account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know an answer to this question for a long time.
Then he finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage reparation".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never received a cent of salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He charged the club 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been assessed as correct, they explained.
The second defendant also received mileage.
All corrections were made in cash, for this he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cancels another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel cuts that have been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cancellations at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the number of jobs in its corporate customer segment from 25,000 to 30,000.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (€2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
The Hewlett-Packard stock fell by 2.3 percent.
The group, which grew up with printers in Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and the other services.
Both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently increased the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
Revenues thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the shift in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted lately to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans include a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly result in rejection: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent find positive.
24% are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence on Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind them a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
Officials used pepper spray continuously at first.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees slumped together and suffered from breathlessness.
The press spokespersons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world observes when the U.S. Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates are raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, which last week believed the Fed would do so, now thinks the Fed will last a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may be leaving the zero range and launching a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. CET
Death shooter at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that he was “suffering” at the first murder and wanted “he could undo it,” authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency room staffer that police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman I've ever loved."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss' daughter was "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been meeting with Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his livability indicates on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s 1,000 executives will cost the job of the company.
With the pilot union, however, there are new negotiations.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue energy, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board team led by Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr.
With the redesign, Spohr underscores the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the collective bargaining conflict with the Pilots Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to resume after the judicially halted strike this Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results "in a year with a forecast record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background is in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots the savings concept "wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group’s low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing outside defender cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless 15-minute attack by Héctor Moreno after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time, and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger."
Related: Manchester United Suffers Luke Shaw's Loss in PSV Defeat
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very serious injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the court, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
It’s one thing all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message we've missed so far."
All is well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content specification of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. However, one love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was completely unknown, Theodor Seuss was hostage, and in 1991.
As if that weren’t suspicious enough yet: Cameron’s text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website, starting as follows: “In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is bewildered by the money-loving, trees-cutting, thneed-knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the name-given Lorax, a hounding, mous-bearded creature, "who speaks in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Coming across Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test Series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear any 2012 scars, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are geared towards results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as – and I said this earlier – players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, it would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own fate.
Hopefully, if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only accusation you can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a striker I highly value.
He is an X-Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.
He needs to get at least the same chances as the one before him, but of course this depends on the team lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, popped up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a striker can't beat there, and that left-handed guy has already shown he's a devil's guy from cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his statistics — an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a point, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup.
I always felt that he was made for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, isn't in the one-days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team builders do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit camp (Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain in influx if the economy collapses by 2017
David Cameron’s unfermented renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to be the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely fighting over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always out of their own guilt, are fed up with Britain’s self-created agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes they usually don’t want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that it would also dislike them if they endangered social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking UK inside the EU tent – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – and lets see through that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don’t care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the exaggerated long-lasting like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to rip a leg to help the selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 at a ratio of 2:1.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist, who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about them, but found that if you’re sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you’d better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum swirls, because Blair had put the principle on the EU’s unadopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a backdoor to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs time to waste on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I say it kindly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye trend and the wilder fields of Tory’s small Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but Not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried on television to be silly towards his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “in all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow supporters and MPs, according to all reports, at their Monday evening session.
Whatever Corbyn's touchy bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and, above all, in the whirlwind of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that will allow him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities with NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “Principle Report” last month and described it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy foundation" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims “build on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said, "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors were previously said to have received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 attendees at the meeting said they were receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received according to reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s Tobacco Board.
The group’s research “significantly acknowledges” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage most products do to most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to before.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters like BBC4.
After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time on Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions or sends programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programs that others don't do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense, of course.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what public television is like.
I don’t think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion missions to justify broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all those obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio – and she should take an example to “inform, educate and entertain” public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, which he said were only a handful shown on television, and to enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by eruptions of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work by turning on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brains of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unimpeded and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-weapons Trade Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg cuffs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to exacerbate weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you travel with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) you can read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... Customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs at Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of bus keys claimed to gain “access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet.”
Transport for London doesn't find this postering "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, noting that they have to go outside into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works charitably with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding advertising for the arms fair – by an empty space of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady company advertising, but "by blushing with bright colors and animation, it remains more sticky."
“They did a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors exhilarate fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order by the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes a “uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target.”
Whatever it does, it won’t be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student dormitory, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I had annoyed – and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student dormitories ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It’s tempting to talk: people tell you where you’re coming from, if and where you’ve taken the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Let go of people.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting places, but they’re also the places where people dress and get their underwear done.
Regarding this: Don’t think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by conviviality - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student dormitories had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
As you start the university at the height of the baking mania, knocking on people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to go to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that you belong to the people who sit in the glasshouse in the truest sense of the proverb.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they minded making drum & bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had her own music splattered, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse moved into the same student dormitory by chance?
Conversely, would it not be awkwardly embarrassing if you held a roommate for your future spouse, approached her, separated again, and then had to see her every day, and perhaps witnessed her pulling all mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way – but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their non-closed room, the boundary between a ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding – but never soak someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't tack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who do not have much money in the central Franconian corner valley.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-earner."
“I’m showing how you can still build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old says in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a common room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
This is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have carried out my project correctly under construction law.
It always makes it particularly complicated the impending Damoclesschwert Special Construction and the Pitch Ordinance.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a terraced house, you need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no space for this.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely wrong.
But don’t you exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True: We have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-earner.
I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message informing that the "software update failed".
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to go back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room for them – but Apple has made this less likely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to the update being cancelled.
iOS 9 release still on schedule despite WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9: the least exciting, but the best update yet from iOS 9: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system
You should also make sure that you have checked our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second highlighted before the start of the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking on the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of players increased to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is the recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit of the First Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that was received by chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot contribute the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quarterly office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors will now receive information on questions such as health insurance or benefits from health and nursing insurance companies.
For years, our outpatient care service has established that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"A lot of benefits from the cash registers are also often not used, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly yet understood," explained the new owner Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Citizens' Hospital as well as the outpatient service "Amadeus" as the head of the Altenhilfe business unit.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Seniorenzentrum and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior centre for care and care", described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new neighbourhood office in the city centre is seen by the two managing directors in particular in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to reunification in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
With this, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-ligist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the 16th final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against third-team FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
The game will be played on Tuesday 6 October at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game will go over the stage, now we have planning certainty," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hummer, who also points to the now launched pre-sale of tickets.
It is special for our team to play against a third league.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by victories at the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-league finisher SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang dies at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the Künstlerhaus said on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese throws policewoman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unsuccessful in Bremen.
Once a footballer, Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, he has not gone against it.
Meadow was just cutting her hair in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking space guard standing outside issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the fine in front of her feet, the "Bild" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.

Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for the flourishing of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panamanian authorities have ripped out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were traveling on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men then shouted at the young man and hit him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal rupture and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends came in haste and spoke to the racket calmly, he first let go of his victim.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove demonstratively past it several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man walked outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the racket and another male person.
With the help of a baton, they beat the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf’s mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still halfway to his successor in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310,000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training in the Verden hospital and also wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed positions in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is volunteering in the DRK willingness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Mullers, both internists, want to settle down as GPs.
"This is why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the computer system is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," said Bernd Bormann, mayor of the Samtgemeinde.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to the practice every quarter in Felstehausen, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
There is another family practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s office hours continue to look at familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff from the Felsenhausens take over.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen smiling.
She feels a little sadness after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will certainly still see many times," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000-square-meter plot."
"Before I've always pushed myself before gardening, now this could be different".
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
“Now border controls are also being lifted at our southern border,” said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain in place in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so “of course”.
The care and safety of people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even across the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and possibly also set up corridors for the refugees.
However, this is not what Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar saw in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will intensify the surveillance of the border, especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, however, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
“Each EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system will not work,” Györkös Znidar said.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already attempted to enter eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid in the evening hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, in the course of the day more buses are expected.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel further through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the already predicted shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that in the event of a strong influx of refugees, his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this country since 2007, and the EU partners have been consistently giving the country a good testimony on the standard of border controls since then.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local spotlight in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
At the moment, it would not be a very high number of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals, who have been accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is said to have been used to make insider trades in the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators said a total of more than 100 million dollars were garnered.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders will ultimately be caught," the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lively operation around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People do their groceries, sometimes fast walking, sometimes cozy strolling.
You drive the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Stop city trains.
Pulsing, boisterous life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the title "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grabs the chalk and supplements the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "travel through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop short, read, say sentences like "so far I'm not yet" and then move on.
Over and over again, small discussions develop on the margins about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also present.
“Only when I realize that the end will come for me in this world at some point, I can live responsibly,” says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with personal experience with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought volunteers by appeal, it immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany affected and relatives in households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences she has had.
"I see life from another waiting, I think it's precious and I appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of denomination.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its earnings outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transports of heavy and large parcels, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is “producing solid returns considering the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, stagnating sales in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx stocks fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The central bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: to keep U.S. employment and prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in the global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds – even if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the Stifel Nicolaus & Co. brokerage firm.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing the financial market to be insecure.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that she expects an increase in the rate this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world contracted at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered a bit this month, with the Dow now being almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the financial market events and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be taking the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint by the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “smalle” its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., remarked this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advocates for an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognizable effects on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Interest Rate Setting Committee.
The recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should rush ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash desks and has various take-away options.
What's there: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide gears are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses she still likes to teach.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Strasse.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different from a real school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder Sportgelände is progressing step by step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a construction law "exception" or "liberation" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "seat roof with non-middle first and roof supernatant" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This brings together a wonderfully large southern roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which should be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike prescribed in the development plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" became necessary because the development plan does not allow any "exceptions" with regard to the inclination of the roof - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively in the case of liberation requests.
However, gymnastics construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are included in the costs.
Grants are expected from the school and broad sports promotion.
In the next process step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for inspection.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
That is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district provide, the Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the further existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who are unable to work in Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, which agreed to take the lead from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this in any case means an "upgrade" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "inner medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, will be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiss, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiss couldn't say there were several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," Fischer said of the quasi-movement to the Lech, which had been received by the employees "positively and very understandingly".
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are challenged tonight (20:15) at the Bergische HC.
Although the leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the abernting on a cornfield near Pratau (district of Wittenberg) several hunters were in service, the police said.
After a fire, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-Year-Olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youngsters and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing since Saturday from Rhineland-Palatinate has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old man, who was also arrested on Tuesday night, is considered to have confessed the crime and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve after a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal belongings of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, there was finally a suspicion of a crime against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted in police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the detention judge on Wednesday, the investigators charged him with manslaughter.
Information about the circumstances of the crime should bring further investigations.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing to a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also accounts for significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is proposing a housing deficit, which is increasing from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were already missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals in large cities were forced to live in flat-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slumber on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are to boost social housing.
For example, the property acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidised apartments could be suspended for a limited time.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are required.
The state bank KfW’s refugee shelter funding program is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
There is practically no way to pass through Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the way via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit via Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border was sealed off, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to arrive in Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary closed its border for refugees the previous day.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can pass through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, it’s women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia with the EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid by bus as well as by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to get to Croatia on foot across the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not come across border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the end of Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicted people face imprisonments of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transitzons" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - at the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, there were 40 refugees.
In practice, however, no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a “safe third country”.
Rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barrier gratings were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this transformation.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government data.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with travel cases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped train traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was the end for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said right away, we'll take them to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN talk.
They were very grateful.
One man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very happy about that," said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE train in Wels to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening, in order to try it after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still over the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociably, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has put the Hungarian government’s attitude in the dark circle of National Socialism, both officially and publicly.
Those who suffer from this policy are not only the Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also find that the “promised country” that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
In view of the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for protection seekers in our country.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee housing.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center in Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday also took place without much turmoil, Konrad said and praised the organizational "mastery achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a “crisis situation”.
Overall, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks – 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the country’s leaders.
These would have assured him to also create quarters for the upcoming refugees.
“It’s going well in Upper Austria,” Ferry Maier said.
The former VP mandator supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
We also hope for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it cannot be possible for quarters to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, explains Konrad with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told falsehood in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier did not cause the Republic any costs, they themselves explained.
You want to increase your number of employees to three to four.
His own neighborhood search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, other locations should be checked for their suitability in case of an emergency.
The head of the city criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts have to contribute here as well.
Seehofer: "Borders are not closed"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed to the further action in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
Refugees can continue to travel to Germany.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is for Pühringer "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented out to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later acquiring them.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the site by S&T, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2,700 square meters in the building are already rented out, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are the focus.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the Taubenmarkt arcade: after all, she has now received growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, it had been remodeled for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store," Breit says.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also inspired by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been cradled by her mother.
I am most suitable when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get enchanted when they see a beautiful handbag, the specialist cannot answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called adversaries.
This property is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become the president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for upsets.
Whether he is xenophobic, rude to journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office is vigorously swirling the election campaign.
And do it well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is known to many in the winery village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-resident site is related to it over -ty corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter style," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, she made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous progeny, which includes the ketchup family Heinz as well as Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “already a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the host, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the announcers.
Trump’s success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mine in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the grandparents’ lives were not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state, which the Palatinate then belonged to.
He had not taken Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly denounced Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as the bullying isn't so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American more distant, "he's always so intoxicating."
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” the 72-year-old said.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
Pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine Donald doing that,” the 68-year-old said.
She would be better off if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says Sarah Bühler, daughter of winegrowers.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemagoers, and interest is also awakening in the US.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the vice president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain climbing villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of Liberal leadership, but it has not caused any major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This drawback seemed irrelevant for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase over ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was below that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers out of 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, gave an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half, a whopping 720,000 spectators.
Hot-seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confidently vote Nine that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to outperform the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Revealed secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically ignored why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", her answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as Wood’s best partner, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is on Earth with both feet, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the home visit last week made her realize that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unconditionally focused on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. – and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had banished Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a wrangling as the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first point return Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special-team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pats on a point restored in the first game quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver to his Origin debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian roller coaster with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and his democratic efforts stopped.
Free voters demand the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn class in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis at Bavaria’s schools, when there are not correspondingly new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Free voters’ parliamentary group will meet in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were other main themes.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will override the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
“That’s not the way it goes, we have to go to the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We would need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bavaria is pushing off, others are not."
“We need to be more actionable.”
However, the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A year-long permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot experiment "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school intermediate level from three to four years is tested - the result is that it will take nine years to graduate.
However, Aiwanger does not go far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever it is desired.
More solid Wall Street helps Dax make the leap
The German stock market has closed with profits after a directionless and nervous trade process over a long period of time.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer kick-off of the US exchanges provided a clear direction, which ultimately brought the Dax upwards by 0.56 percent to 10 188.13 points.
The MDax of medium-sized values gained 0.54 percent to 19 552.88 points.
The technology-intensive TecDax increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the leading index of the eurozone rose by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
The trading venues in London and Paris also recorded solid profits.
In the US, the Dow Jones index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus.
Many Boursians expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to a great decline on the futures exchanges this Friday.
In the meantime, the discussion about the burdens of the nuclear phase-out has pushed RWE’s shares to a record low and left deep marks on Eon as well.
According to Spiegel, German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The German government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by a further 3.22% at the top of the Dax.
According to a trader, a positive report by US investor magazine "Barron's" had an effect on the weekend.
Accordingly, investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip builder.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen’s benefits increased by 1.26 percent.
In the German pension market, the return on the circulation of publicly traded federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The federal future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
In the afternoon, the price of the euro fell to $1,1262.
By noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference price at $1.1305 (1.1268).
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of commerce, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers do not yet exist.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the youth centre Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of commerce, commerce and housing.
We are waiting for the appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the ring road / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
For the first time, the investor publicly presented plans for the project.
Several residents continue to be alarmed - they fear the sale of their recreational retreat
For months, negotiations had been held behind closed doors, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who accused the investor and the administration of mystery, Ralf Behrends went from the system construction management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Hefty reactions among sea hut owners who had come to the meeting prompted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea-bude owner and member of the board of directors for the interest representation of the neighbours, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that the traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be entire bus loads, so that this pays off", says Schulz.
However, what exactly happens on the area of the former restaurant, which is well over one hectare, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must first have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were also variable.
Twin offspring at gorillas in Frankfurt zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to welcome young people to its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body so far.
First, the “picture” was reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted Tuesday a broad gravitational pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical hurricane over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined gravitational pressure system, approximately in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations will double to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery to treat type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery — stomach bypass and gastric hose formation — to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained approximately equal to 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes resolved completely only at one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix says.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI under 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, with no increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 with their BMI.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets after years the swarm of her youth again, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder’s recent novel “Actually We Are Not So.”
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she has been able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions to how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the U.S.’s violent response resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in children's hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intakes among children under the age of 12 who report poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting more and more frequent at these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or for a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teens reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in toddlers, few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of Kansas hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if children get there, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and to store hand sanitizers outside the reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report says.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banishes her from her room.
The police considered the fouled plan to be "talk" and referred disciplinary action to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision between Nordring and Auf Herdenen in a collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the transverse brace towards the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he bumped into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident resulted in property damage of about 10 000 euros, the police said.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumored cuisine: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson’s accusations, and Warburton will be cautious about January re-commitments that could destroy the squad’s unity
Dons increase Celtic lead to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see those games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton Careful in January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox squad’s unity.
Brentford's ex-boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, speaking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been battling with an ankle for two years and hasn’t made it out from Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later lifted - Collum's third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks with what he said, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reproved after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless it's playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the guys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unbeautiful".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into custody.
A respiratory alcohol test showed 0.89 promille in a 16-year-old.
The young man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained in custody at first.
Why I will witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I began to be afraid.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and as there are often more applications available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public relations work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I’ve made.
I don't want to go into all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after moist police chase to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang out the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy waters, just a few meters away from a police officer who was trying to "softly persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a housebreaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop is negotiating".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," senior sergeant Castledine said.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a humorous Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt doping rehearsal at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been withholding himself for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
“I was going to say nothing about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out all at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start to think I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man – whom I’ll name if asked – and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, incumbent President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that make me think it’s going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now makes them think about it.
But I have now reached the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late scratching has led him to say he “can throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule as "laughing" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
Yesterday could have been the same all day.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all realize that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
Police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia approached the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver evasion and neglected assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital, in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rivals for Claims of Rings
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of tackling his players as the “agenda setting” of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ring battles" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed comment on the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League, saying that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said they were focused on tackling only their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team voiced him confidently, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“It keeps popping up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s what has brought the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening to ours on Friday evening and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember being criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he was going to take care of that shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and not points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still encounter them at some stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the pre-finals at AAMI Park, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to gain possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the cafe could have been for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of Maksimovic’s escape.
He has strong relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to reach his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and adheres to a curfew from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab breaks apart
In a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade to the left at the last moment, the police said.
The driver's cab of the accident cause completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone as she slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did, as it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and he then “pretended to be a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were done on the computer by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant used computers and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14, last year, of violating the requirements on January 25 of this year, and of not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Schleusers dodge to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up off the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, left the people at smaller border crossings more and more.
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn along the Inn River since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Exit of tropical storm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong low is the culmination of the tropical storm "Henry", which had moved over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can still be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The crowd does it: every two years the car makers show their new products at the IAA.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars in the compact class are in particular in demand at the moment: According to the German Federal Office for Motor Vehicles (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available to dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is looking forward to an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
As a second variant, the station wagon will follow in the spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what else will be done next to the Astra at the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door model in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
He comes to the market at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: New in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The base model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm).
The Baleno will start selling in Europe in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the DS 4 compact class model, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën outrigger placed their hands on the front panel: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, at the IAA in the compact class, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are added.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has justified an ex-detainee of the Tegel prison, who was housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were only locked up for a few days in the rooms too narrow (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
With this, an ex-detainee was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 at the Berlin-Tegel prison; the toilet was not separated from the restroom.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now back on free foot, was moved to a larger cell.
His indictment for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges repealed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and dismissed the case for re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of detention were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "a diminishing of the legal protection of the personality should be feared."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they granted damages to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had attested to an inmate in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The then plaintiff was housed daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks due to a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked in for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fighting is said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to lack of young people, 19 are to be deleted in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is happening in Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it."
The following overview provides an overview of what is going on in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price commitment every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly favorable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing should be created annually and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion euros per year for this.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market has prevailed - also due to the lack of skilled workers.
A major barrier to accessing the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the construction of networks is therefore the king’s way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the daycare centers, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is very important for the uprooted parents to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.
Refugees willing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive a bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Patienced refugees had to live in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range is shortened to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the new arrivals.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to take a heartfelt stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany,” he said on Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today an issue of society as a whole.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, been an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it is very slowly learning, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention Germany require, must become a reality in the coming years, if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use its possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as man-power and capacities are concerned, we can do that,” he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money has to go into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks to hand out health cards to all arrivals right at the time of registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for by the Asylum Applicant Services Act.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create the language barriers.
The Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has already shown that migrants are being better educated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be covered, she demands.
Many refugees would be helped, but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with the partly other diseases, German doctors would be clear from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who has a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rash and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe appallingness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, only 4% of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can apply for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, usually specialists or doctors who are not trained for the mental illnesses would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leidenschaft", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current mane staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
“It’s important to us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” the 27-year-old junior boss emphasizes.
"Manegen cocktail with a world-city flair", so director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, it wants to record the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to conquer women’s hearts in a storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
“The animals belong to our family,” emphasizes Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the keeping of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroking unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, read every wish from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go to the riding stable.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is especially proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in a cage for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for riding, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and we’re there with our whole heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe’s speech with buhrufs.
Last month they had bullied him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament – this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe’s address.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was “concerned” about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cut will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP’s move, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this field based on the belief that tightly focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it’s only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there’s no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the preseason.
"This type of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s investigation has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that had the most injury days on record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career the way he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand, I’m long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men’s Friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the man’s year, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can’t really buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel all came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to them, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of telephone counseling explained to me: "My audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I get along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you openly talk about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if this weekend you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain kicked off his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as a PSG player, which put the French champion on the road, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim to qualify for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class match from Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances on goal, he was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2-0, causing problems to our opponents and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect over the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which could hold a 2:2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was knocked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran behind the Malmö defense in Marco Verrattis Pass, before closing down Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine international players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two lined up deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on its own, with some flaws and bad finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who pattered in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and was then abandoned after Cavani used it after the restart.
Despite this, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shooting shot that was directed past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan thus scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was knocked down a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from share sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, affected by collapsed commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and devastates markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore’s stock price on trading early Wednesday morning to a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, opening 0.69% higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of its broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25, and will return to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to make a dream come true and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill the dream and once rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This is how a 29-year-old from Gotha County did.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got on wet roads and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 transfer to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
A few years ago, FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight Spanish champions, three cup winners, four Champions League winners, two club world champions, two European champions, one world champion – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championship before the farewell from Barcelona.
"They told me that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't win anything," he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change.
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and in the end celebrated the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night of HBO’s Project Greenlight, seasoned actor Brown interrupted when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s chosen screenplay.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown reacted shockedly, with insulted disbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor's comments of The Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
“I want to ask people to think about – whoever the director will be – how they treat the Harmony figure,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directorial rights to the film; Damon replied that their director "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHAT it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of societal discussion.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colored cessation.
In February, singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' wins first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the challenge within time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!Nachrichten after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, now the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to advance within one half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard pitch.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how it comes,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to finish this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go very focused into the game.
The designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three goals and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swinged the percussion well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (beat training), looked much better at the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Mauer, the only man he was faced with, in front of the designated rookie bat Miguel Sano, who escaped the right-handed Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th Major League leading time this season that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer scored an RBI double against the closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the score of 5-4.
The right-hander, however, stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
At the start of the game, Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers won in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose for 3-0.
“That was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not scoring points in the third inning before being replaced by Reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, is expected to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived there are to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government presidency responsible for the initial reception, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options of action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of “collective looking away”.
Four years ago, one was glad that the chalice of a military involvement had passed by Germany.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on the Austrian TV station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one is being sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s how it’s agreed,” she said.
On the question of an agreement according to which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, applied for a special summit next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September), the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee influx in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial reception and distribution of the people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the prime ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection also get it.
But those who have no prospect of staying can also not stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU in a different way than Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from looking for alternative routes over Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
"Cassini" spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the "Cassini" spacecraft.
Thus, the moon tumbling slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too big for a permanent solid celestial body, according to a message from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles, thus feeding Saturn’s so-called E-ring.
At least on the south pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up on offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had revealed an adductor violation in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of compulsory pause".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course we need to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has “the opportunity to demonstrate its ability”.
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often more likely to be discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and should not smell pleasant.
The peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives savoury dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 aids for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are especially sought after.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements to be ready for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a foehnsturm, then a striking cold front
The next night breaks through the valleys of the northern Alps side of the hair dryer, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the hair dryer valleys.
After drying on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure region over the British Isles in a powerful southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the hair dryer blows in the hair dryer valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in Urnerland, sometimes also with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can sometimes penetrate into the adjoining midland, and even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the southern slope of the Alps begins to accumulate.
This is where the rain starts, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter is to be expected, this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer leaves the air, followed by a cold front with strong, partly whittling rain rolling from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind is warming up strongly to stormy, and temperatures are decreasing significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north at 15 to 20 degrees in autumn, while in the south it becomes sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the popes’ city, as a minority, could often live their faith only in secret for centuries.
The square becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He saw the city at that time as a wicked sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later fight against Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old received his "language" with colourful colors and imaginative forms - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of all books".
The result are cycles devoted to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Fathers.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present day, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
The 75-year-old gives twice as much insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately at all triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
"That's when the upbringing happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this up, perhaps to tolerate myself again with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to make art more important again in a fast-moving time: "The perception of image worlds is now characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is displaced there.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old had not taken care to fully comprehend the Bible, but had chosen the themes that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains". The result was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deep your life and find freedom".
For Möhler, Otmar Alt’s paintings speak both the (biblical) language of love and the language of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Start of construction for BMX-Bahn is approaching
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, earth mounds were modelled for a circuit: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train, this was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused sadness, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to communicate in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
Work on the former indoor pool should then be started without a "further memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is setting a clear sign this weekend.
Football reacts to the growing situation in Germany and assures politicians of their help in tackling the problems ahead.
"I think this is our country's biggest challenge since reunification."
“In principle, no one can say, it’s not about me, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must interest everyone to get to grips with this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'll be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs. Özo<0xC4><0x9F>uz, and the Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he said.
Football can and will help.
But policy must set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
“Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said on the margins of the UEFA conference in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some clubs also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," Leverkusen's sports chief Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
"We football leagues can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said in a statement.
Hoffenheim’s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league”.
This Friday, the women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifier against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their locations is great.
It is just as great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have spent is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will each make 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already retrieved the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses sight in accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the US, he fell after midnight on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand, reports the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bleeded out, was impotent, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
“Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time,” McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important for him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen like this."
"It's important to get up again when you're down."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen excluding combat ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, explaining that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He therefore does not qualify as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore at the weekend, as well as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also miss the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./Sky).
“Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to the training on Friday".
Given the heavy burden of his pros, Tuchel will not only change his tribal elf at the Reus position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of tribal keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He is also very likely to play the second game.
The researched statement by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, thinks midfielder Julian Weigl comprehensible: "That's not how Marco is wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of picking up the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany should, according to the will of the German government, be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair of a "new mobility age".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Strategy Paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver is “not subject to additional liability risks”, the German government wants to “review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt them to the new developments”.
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The German government also wants to advocate for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to arrive in 2020.
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport,” said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical – much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent do not expect it until 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars to be driven by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent expect autonomous cars to be driven by 2025.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control on all roads throughout the journey.
On the highway, this could be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Well, one in four would not let the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to compete in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only in detail.
The final decision will be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title without Timo," said Jörg Rosskopf, the German national coach, during the European Championships in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion will be expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the downside is, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was missing, too, and we became European champions."
“This is what we should focus on,” the World Ranking Fifth said.
England national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has sustained a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was struck in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a fracture of the shin.
Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It’s a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures grouse cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits, among other things – and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on display in the Hypo-Cultural Foundation's Art Hall from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion creator has changed his initially rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because: “To me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death,” he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful dresses,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
The show is not chronologically constructed, but it is an excellently choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort has been put into it: for example, a stylist has been hired to freshen up the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It represents the designer’s first, timid fashion walk attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought it later, of course.
For his first fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener Spitze as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, creates an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and embroidery.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been broken away.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.
The mass goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the US.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also relates to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine stitches small beads in some places.
Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before I could not do anything with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney is still daring to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a remake, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It’s about the nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy to the world more broadly
The economy needs to be broader open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), take up private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved through test programs.
The initiative is important as it allocates a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened to private investment.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of third-party-funded companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby encouraging consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve toxin.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve toxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limits, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unavailable.
In return for this easing, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low loaded that they already meet the planned maximum levels today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates heavily over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through coal burning.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Green Bundestag MP Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
