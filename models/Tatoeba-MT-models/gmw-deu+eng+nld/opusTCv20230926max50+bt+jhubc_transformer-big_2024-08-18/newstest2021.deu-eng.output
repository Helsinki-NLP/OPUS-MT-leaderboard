Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a road accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen around 9.30 p.m.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but still stroked it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the swiping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At the moment, he was driving his motorcycle in the green stripes next to the road and had it rolled out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the bee and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvest Helpers Infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
Infected people were separated from uninfected employees at the farm, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infections have to be eliminated and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
“After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvesters,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be closely monitored.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came with "annoyance."

Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
Data storage is currently suspended.
However, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data – instead of the envisaged ten weeks for half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to make “urgently required adjustments in the law already now,” the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data storage is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be possible to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already in June in favour of storing data.
NBA: Stripclub wreaks havoc on Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a Los Angeles Clippers basketball pro, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he went to the comic strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, “Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, D.R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training matches are preparing for the season finale beginning at night on Friday.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a Testoffsensive for large farms.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has frightened authorities and politics.
Nearly 500 crop workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, more than one-third of them have become infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now quarantined and closed with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the more than 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience Bite": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him."
“His mandate is plagued by conscientious objections and very much taken away by the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man threatens to face ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire had erupted in three remote places in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
Debate on the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel said.
He stressed: "For the clubs that can most likely become dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one does not get around the debate about whether it is not necessary to facilitate associations that want to break into this phalanx, the involvement of investors."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“It remains a legal risk to move investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market,” Grindel said.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced it to the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It’s been very humanly busy for me.”
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences,” Grindel said.
"I have handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and without any hesitation.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a secret out of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
Black Lives Matter: Injured and One Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have spiked again due to Donald Trump’s use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed protesters.
Hundreds of partly armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group that calls itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed in a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
Police said they were detaining a suspect.
So far, she has not provided any details of the circumstances of the deed.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that, like many in the city, he was “inconsolable and stunned” about what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars in front of a youth prison, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or bodily harm.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters hit windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
Also there were windows knocked in a court and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical Costumes Defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug burn, many came to their own with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-Flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historicals were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting with her husband for more than 25 years at the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen.
This time in the corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at Luitpold Casino, watching the historicals while strolling and listening to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But they lack the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant in part more work.
For example for Christina Gold, who participates in the festival in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
“It’s harder, otherwise we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even though individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be held again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, another Rakoczy riding tournament will take place.
28 corona cases in Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second-tier CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on July 20, despite the first corona cases, a low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid had so far the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the departure into the B-group of the Second League is imminent.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office investigated for a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced descent of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a quarantine hotel.
“Until the sixth day of quarantine, they didn’t get a fresh towel or gel,” the sports newspaper AS wrote.
The photos show how players had hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
“It’s not good or sufficient,” he wrote.
The hotel staff said they were happy with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed the allegation of deliberately endangering public health.
They have not violated the corona rules set by the Football Association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before the departure, there had been four infected people by 19 July, but all of them were isolated and had not travelled along.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members had been retested.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, the Corona test would have been positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.

Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can quite imagine to continue his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team to determine the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona-Pause.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was, "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think, “What if?”
The cyclist acknowledged that there are aspects with which he is becoming increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona era what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me".
The time trial specialist enters the competition again in the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

Prior to joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
“A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing you again with Niko Kovac,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat in the unification.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the eighth-final semi-final against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.

Argentina rejects counter offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," he said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer viable under current conditions.
Argentina has called on its private creditors to waive some of their $66 billion ($59 billion) claims.
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is holding on to its latest offer and is not willing to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last amounted to more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest receivables of US$503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up work, the normal day-to-day business is already on full tour.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, did not suffice to completely relocate the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring county, the city of Eggenfelden has been a household name for a long time.
During local visits with her family in the past months, she has once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career: after studying law in Passau, she completed her internship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary professor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also trained "in addition to" the doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by her move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of Lutz Feller’s approaching retirement, she had seen the right time for the full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private grocery point.
She has already made contact with a local institution with regard to kindergarten or crib places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators according to the current status," Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt has a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season’s ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal seats for spectators, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the bank if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently well advised to take a stable page length first.
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund head of marketing praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial renunciation, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary renunciation has a different effect than when we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-term work."
Tiny Miracles: Early Start to Life with a Few Hundreds of Grams
Hardly heavier than a packer's butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 premature babies that are taken care of annually at the Graz Children’s Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few — like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael — are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be at voice - "and how," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if of course they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the students the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Subsequently, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even though all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD Sports Show.
Because due to the corona pandemic the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There, the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-liga champion Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the start of the third league.

The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her out big by the side of Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dunkle Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Little Song for a Body".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage broke down too.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses final at comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler have missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which had been decided by the majority of the Federal Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
“There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.”
CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes rather of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD".
Blume expects that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the swelling as "certainly right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Board of Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing "home-faithful German youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The Meuthen Force's maneuver is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the Constitutional Guard and tries to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the ghosts it called.
A throw-out does not change anything," SPD general secretary Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD national association and the faction held up to today to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants in the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the forwarding by the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate computationally 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then,” said Tim Meyerjürgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the Corona-Pause.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" became involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
"But ultimately we are here as organizers responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival site and into the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a contact tracking according to the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg reassured for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the dressage tournament in the Austrian city of Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg made four victories at four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was unable to beat on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the Kür.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on Sunday in the special.
On Saturday, too, the German lay on Quantaz clearly in front of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first prize ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14-16 August.
More air traffic controllers in the future in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" donates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to make the start of the study not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the air traffic control academy of the DFS are being used equally.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in the course of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms are in the Air Traffic Management degree program.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we strongly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of the DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Chair of the Foundation is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, said: "The professorship of the foundation is an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor program Air Traffic Management".
For Worms University of Applied Sciences, trust in German air traffic control was both a motivation and an obligation to further expand its teaching and research competence in the fields of aviation for the future.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasizes: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences, with its focus on air transport, has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A45 motorway was closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopters were in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 a.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the bend straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of around 2,000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis once again highlighted the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right – and will they remain?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel in slaughtering, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee leave if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation at the customer’s disposal for large areas of the craft, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety plant, that's a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is not possible to explain why different labour law should apply in the future when portioning and packaging cheese than in sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day, following the results of an audit by the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
They often did not have a break.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, "trick-rich constructions" have circumvented these.
"Now has to be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, measures that not only affect the meat industry are also measures - for example, higher test rates for Occupational Safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft proposed by the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transports," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more checks will also require more staff.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to police.
A child was easily injured.
Two other people had been rescued in the accident, a spokesman for the district management office Wesel said.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz proceeded peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera Square also took place peacefully on Sunday night.
Lastly, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the start of the lockdown.
The police had been in service with numerous officials since the early evening, a larger police force was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, a ban was imposed on the opera square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrators.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the road on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her home town of Homme, when her car came off the road from a previously unexplained cause and crossed several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the emergency forces did not find anyone among the high corn plants.
The seriously injured was taken by ambulance to the Kasseler Klinikum for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were present.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1-0 before the halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer to be displaced from place one two days before the end of the season of the Serie A.
The second-place Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Despite visual superiority, Juventus was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free-kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the glaring, but decisive success.
The fouling meter shot to the latte in the 89th minute should have only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal-hunter score correctly beaten.
“It’s complicated to stay at ball height mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s reassuring lead at the top of the table was most recently also due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will become a top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund-based Ciro Immobile already has 34 goals in his account after his triple pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth Lazio Rome table at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
Italy's current juve pro Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n holds the record.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the Champions League semifinals, but will face Olympique Lyon on 7 August to make up for a 0-1 draw in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparative values for the previous years do not exist, but the law enforcement authorities are increasingly doing work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the prosecutors’ offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as shown by the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneously competing against each other or they had taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in a comparatively few cases, the rashers are caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been issued.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials of past years, and indicated more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The 8th motorway is particularly popular with lawnmowers. Drivers there repeatedly brake off traffic in order to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
There, a speed limit is used to try to brake the lawns on the particularly affected section between narrows and geisings.
The mostly high-priced and pampered sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country for lawns.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibitor threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Anyone who in such a way transcends all the rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for more police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher checks on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-touring force fair to become more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died nationwide in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bumped into a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, stricter penalties are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races is not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Blue Light of July 23: Thirstful burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man who served himself with drinks at the fridge and then left the snack through a door that had previously been knocked in.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
The police are accepting further witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory at final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann won his second day at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt in a mass sprint after already winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season three and four wins for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently decided the mountain time trial for himself in the morning and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 drivers finished the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” the 26-year-old said.
300 meters ahead of the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay reanimation," a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescue forces soon took the resuscitation measures.
The child in danger of life was transported to the Uniklinik under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
Police routinely began investigations into the accident.
The fire department spokesman said: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1,100 people
Hundreds of cars and, at times, over 1,000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to police Mittelfranken, the Nuremberg transport police had detected an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
Officials were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small part of the attendees were to be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
Based on the vehicles and persons on the ground, it can be assumed that these were predominantly spectators.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the adherence to the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the ground were terminated around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The Central Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what’s happening and will continue to implement increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of spectators,” it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make any damage.
"Young people should finally get their cars back undamaged."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time employment abuse
The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker money.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board responsible for the operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
“So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are diverging, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The youngsters then left the park.
On Saturday night some youngsters would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Time and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation there are always accumulations where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Ordinance are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at dusk.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, the state authorities in Linz reported.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was fixed at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist town in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of interns who had celebrated in several venues and could have become infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0:0) win against direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified fourth for the king class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-match period, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League semi-final opponents of FC Bayern, won with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton, who moved past the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been standing as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The top score is Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses will also be happy.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature demolition or a playoff of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
After all, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu’s leader are getting more and more violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, a water cannon to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site reported "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv for suspecting spraying pepper spray on protesters from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was easily injured on the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several protests against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for handling the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held up for quick releases and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate last stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever new record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end accident claimed nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: "Probably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn off."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He hit the back of the car.
In the accident, three inmates in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea shuts down border town after corona suspect
North Korea has so far seen a "bright success" in its own measures to defend against the coronavirus.
For the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Because of a first official corona suspect in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city out of fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the sealed-off country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defence measures as “bright success.”
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected by a “outlier” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The man left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party’s Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday, according to its own statements.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and to isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "extinction case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
Kaesong is estimated to have about 300,000 people.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale city centre development-east project," says the city's central press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence even rejecting it.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, commerce and IT), the project developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council not to let now after almost ten years of preparation fail, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "out-of-parliamentary opposition", "unintentional", "speculation", "disgust" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The city is cheaper to renovate the Technical Town Hall, contrary to statements by the city administration after grants, of which Klein is convinced of its existence, for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not by an investor: This was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the former valley for administrative areas, and a smaller-scale city centre remodeling ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporal reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise due to the neglect of regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and due to little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban daycare facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City Funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must take care of corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the League of Supersport Cars can start regular operation, the first test drives have now been started.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,” says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves dazzlingly and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track very little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests,” he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely crowded calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will join the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain tourists for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine conditions.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the holiday date, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot said in a statement.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's notice".
Nearly a month after the end of the coronavirus emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country rises again.
Virologists mainly blame nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the UK’s favorite holiday destinations.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths have been reported.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on Navy Day in his country that the warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, unique in the world, the Russian naval forces’ combat capabilities would be expanded, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the hypersonic zirconium rocket built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It will also be built on the atomically equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also rode a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual naval associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Department of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help over Corona Difficult
Washington - This year's first hurricane across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. Climate Change Authority NOAA on the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuates called for caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," Abbott said, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
Looking at the hurricane in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated considering it sweeps through an area that is the most heavily affected area of the state by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They shouldn’t disregard practices “to which we have become accustomed,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stay at a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, they should be tested for corona in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the coast of Texas, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further into the interior and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane "Douglas" was on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour heading for Hawaii.
However, the hurricane center expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time), then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, according to a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, one below average even at ten percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is watching the storms closely and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic has lost two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry on the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR gone so hard against a team," the Corriere dello Sport commented.
Host Naples had gone through a goal of outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute in the lead, in the 32nd minute, Filip Djuricic initially cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The referee team also withdrew the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61th) after the VAR.
In the follow-up season, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology makes for records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, has the third most minutes of operation, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive royal class duels.
In Munich’s muddy weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final back against Chelsea on 8 August is unlikely to be possible, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, the Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the misfortune of the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his winning-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the Royal Class Final on 23 August.
"We have simply mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and trophy excellently.
Now we have to make the special thing,” Flick said.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, the first time is the eighth-final duty against FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the away game before the Corona break, the Londoners in the domestic arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test for the match is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in to his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the Double, on a one-off August.
He greeted 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble-shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the pitch after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all new ones, has been well-intentioned," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to co-train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the game rhythm in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy", the head coach emphasized, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is what matters especially in the 0-to-100 tuning.
Working with his current team was "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focussedness on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were present, including the emigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the royal class season are not secured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to win its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks were added to the so far confirmed ten Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o, Portugal.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points on the traditional Italian circuit in Imola.
As a result, the 2020 race calendar currently includes 13 runs.
“We are delighted to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In this extraordinary season, 15 to 18 races will be held in the premier class of motorsport.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, which were already officially targeted in December, media reports say that there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules of Procedure Requires Races on Three Continents
The rules of Formula 1, however, require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are being driven, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the impending corona crisis.
Returning to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection is critical in Brazil
Due to the strained corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the US, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The rejection of the Americas race was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection came not surprisingly for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
The number of infections in the area of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous Latenight show via video-switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate kivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the world’s powerful people.
The teenage girl also spoke about her famous "evil gaze" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known Latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful people.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children is going out on the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridicule them on social media or even try to silence them find them "funny" as you show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitterly evil look at US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the nude sailor sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the US president at the moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert’s question, she replied only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert probably hadn’t expected the quick answer and disappeared laughingly from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder immobile with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe now on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund-based Ciro Immobile continues to have best chances of becoming a top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the replay times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the fourth of the table now has 34 goals in his account before the end of the season - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar hit Sampdoria Genoa with the lead in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a fast ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long legendary band in London in 1967, to this day unforgettable is his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all profits to the group for charities.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a great crucifix.
Mental problems also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At an early age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to play as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green did not cope with the media turmoil, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album Rumours sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he re-launched in 1996 with a group of befriended musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free of Drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in his lifetime – and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
