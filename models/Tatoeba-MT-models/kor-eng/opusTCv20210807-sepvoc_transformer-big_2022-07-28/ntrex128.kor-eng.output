Senators in Wales were worried about “looking like an idiot.”
Some senators are disappointed by the proposal to change their title to MWPs.
It happened because of a plan to change the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Regardless of the political spectrum, senators are worried that it will lead to ridicule.
One Labor senator was worried that his group would “achieve a rhyme between TWP and Pwp.”
Information for readers living outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
One Welsh National Party senator said the group as a whole was “not happy” and offered an alternative.
One Welsh conservative said he noticed that his group had an "open stance" on the name change, but that it was a bit of a pun to change from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of u.
Congress is currently enacting legislation to introduce a name change, and "the final decision on what to call members of Congress, of course, will be their own issue."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on a proposal that had broad support for calling the Parliament the Welsh National Assembly.
Regarding the issue of the title of senator, the committee supported members of the Welsh National Assembly or WMPs, but the MWP gained the most support in public consultations.
Senators are likely to propose an alternative, but efforts to reach an agreement would be a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to file a draft bill on the change in the coming weeks.
The reform bill also includes changes to the way Congress works, including rules for disqualification of senators and the establishment of a committee system.
Senators will vote on what they will be called when they discuss the bill.
Macedonians take part in a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was an effort to resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, a neighboring country called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that the names of its northern neighbors cause territorial problems and has repeatedly refused to join NATO and the EU.
Macedonian President Jorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Winter Bell of Silence as Harem Struggle's Church
"Historically, the older people I was talking to were bars and churches in every corner," said Adam.
“Today, it’s not both.”
He said he couldn’t understand that the bar was gone.
“People do social life in different ways,” he says these days.
“The bar is no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis.”
In the case of the church, he worries that the money he sells will not remain as the leaders expect, and that soon the leaders will return to where they started.
He added that the church could be replaced by an apartment building with condominiums of people who would not help the rest of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of the people who buy condominiums in this building will be white," he said. "So we're going to make the day ahead when these churches will be closed, because it's unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will be part of that church."
The two churches were built by white believers before Harlem became the Metropolitan Community in 1870, ten years after St. Martin, or Black Metropolis.
Existing white Methodists migrated in the 1930s.
A black admirer had legal ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black believer who was under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against retailers and opposed hiring or promoting black people on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they ordered a carillon.
Johnson’s son, Reverend David Johnson, and St. Martin’s successors proudly called him “the servant of the poor.”
The expert who played Carillon in July called it by a different name: the gift of culture and the incomparable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by the black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather said St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St. Martin in the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, with some of the church’s private leaders and others intervening in the bishopric.
The Chamber of Deputies, the governing body of the diocese, consists of private leaders. Although the Chamber was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors who sent the diocese, it was written to the diocese in July with the fear that the diocese would "prefer to transfer the cost" to the Chamber.
Some parish residents complained about the lack of transparency in the parish portion.
Attacking 13-year-old boy on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving on the first day of Saturday’s Lobster season in California, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the boy was diving with a friend for about an hour and a half Saturday morning and heard the boy scream for help and rowed in a group to pull him out of the water.
Hamel initially caught the lobster and thought it was exciting, but he realized he was screaming.
I'm bitten!"
His collarbone was completely torn," Hamel said, realizing that the shark had caught the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is listed on the Critical Care List.
The shark attack has not been identified.
General Larry Giles, a lifeguard, told the press that a shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but decided it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities cut off access to Swany's Ponto beach from Kasablad in Esinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
There are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury will face boots, Sufford Lugs and Devenhams at the department store-style beauty corner where experts work.
As part of a massive roll-out to the ever-growing British beauty market, where fashion and homeware sales are receding, the larger beauty corner will be in more stores next year if it is demonstrated in 11 stores across the country and proven successful.
Investing in the beauty industry is like the supermarket once sought out the shelf space occupied by TV, microwave and homeware.
Sainsbury said he would order up to 3,000 products to double the size of the beauty corner. The brands included are Leblon, DeCie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Popo, the first of its kind.
Existing brands, including L’Oréal, Maybelline, and Bertsby, will also occupy more space in brand areas similar to those found in stores such as boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the boutique make-up line, allowing most of its products to be released as vegan friendlys, a favorite among younger consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, will pilot two Sainsbury stores. It will open for the first time in Croydon, south London, and for the second time later this year in Seli Oak, Birmingham.
The shift in buying small amounts of groceries from online shopping and local convenience stores means that there is something more to be done to convince supermarkets to visit people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight off discounts like Aldina Riddle, which has more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury also introduced the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and a large number of Habitats, as he bought two chains two years ago. Sainsbury says it boosted grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to overhaul the beauty and medicine department eventually failed.
Sainsbury attempted to co-venture with boots in his early 2000s, but the tie-up ended in a dispute over how to split the income of drug stores in the supermarket.
The new strategy will be followed three years ago at £125 million after Sainsbury sold the 281-store pharmaceutical business to Selesio, the owner of Lloyd’s pharmaceutical chain.
Sainsbury says Lloyd will play an important role in the plan by expanding the reach of luxury skin care brands such as La Rochefoze and Bish in four stores.
"We changed the look and feel of the beauty corner to improve the customer experience," says Paul Mills-Hicks, director of commerce at Sainsbury.
We also put in specially trained colleagues to provide advice.
The scope of our brand is designed to fit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient location means we are now in an eye-catching destination of beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
After Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million deal, Peter Jones becomes ‘excited’
Dragons Den Stein, Peter Jones, has been “disgraced” since TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million deal involving his lifestyle brand business to focus on a new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their homeware and accessories brand Trulli.
Their business has been likened to the brand heel of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den Star Peter Jones infuriated by his exit from the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on a massive new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones acknowledged a new deal worth up to £1.5 million in a tense Tuesday meeting at his corporate headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, which meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homeware and accessories brand Trully.
The business was likened to a brand heel in Guines Paltrow, and was twice as lucky as Willowby's, about £1,100.
When 37-year-old Willoughby revealed on Instagram that she was leaving Truli, Jones left England on a plane and headed for one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, Trulli was by far Holly’s priority at the top.
It would have been her organ’s future for decades to come.
Her decision shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was almost out of date.
Marlowe has a warehouse full of goods waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the UK’s most commercial stars will be costly due to the vast investment in products and the possibility of postponement of release, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware.
And this will mean the end of old friendships.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Waldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for decades.
Willowby set up Cap and Trulli in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined in March as chairman.
The couple spends the holidays together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Waldwin's TV production company.
Willowby will be Marks & Spencer’s brand ambassador and will replace Anthony McFatlin as host of ITV’s ‘I Am a Celebrity’.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not go into his business.”
A tough conversation, and we fell in love.
He joked in the news media about commenting that someone might consider him “unpresidential” and criticizing him for having such a positive attitude toward North Korea’s leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so easily?
Trump spoke out with his fake “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
According to his description, Kim was interested in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations were halted.
It has been more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Yongho, told world leaders at the UN. At Saturday's meeting, North Korea does not hear from the U.S. about its "reasonable" response to the move in relation to North Korea's initial disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continued pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his meeting speech.
"We're doing well for North Korea," he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results, including ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the remaining American troops home.
And he defended an unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Chairman Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of getting 10,000 people out there into this crowded arena, we have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis destroy the island and kill hundreds of people in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told they didn’t need it.
More than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, but there was no official domestic disaster announcement required to receive international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not asking for support from the international community," said Mr. Breath.
While Save the Children’s Run is building a team to go to Fallu, it’s not yet clear if overseas staff will be able to work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster authorities, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Fallu and seeing if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Assuming that the earthquake continues continuously in Indonesia, it sadly remains unprepared for the anger of nature.
Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, but they are not easily found on other coastlines.
Despite the effectiveness of the warnings, there is a possibility that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Fallu may continue to lead to loss of life.
At its best, it is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics support even more complex.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Fallu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesia's backward infrastructure a major part of his campaign, and invested heavily in roads and railroads.
But the lack of funding bothered Joko's administration, as he faces next year's election.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of interfaith tensions that remain in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslim believers embrace a more conservative form of belief.
Christians and Muslim gangs used swords, bows and arrows and other cruel weapons to fight on the road, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving the camp.
Example: Chelsea vs. Equalizer with Liverpool's Daniel Sterridge
Daniel Sterridge saved Liverpool from London's Stamford Bridge in the 89th minute of Saturday's loss to Chelsea.
Sterridge received a pass from Sherdan Shakiri, while the team was 1–0 behind, about 30 yards ahead of the Chelsea goal.
He tapped the ball to his left before he fired a shot in front of the distant post.
When moving toward the upper right corner of the goal, the ball flew far above the zone.
The ball eventually fell to the goal over the jumping kepa arizabala.
"I tried to get into that position in order to get the ball right. Players like Shark always play as far ahead as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I had a touch, and I didn't think it was too much, so I shot it."
In the 25th minute, after scoring against Belgian star Eden Azar, Chelsea beat him 1-0 at halftime.
Before separating near Midfield and sprinting in half to Liverpool, the Blues striker passed to Matteo Kovacci.
Cobacic played a quick jib n'go in midfield.
Then he led Azar into the box and shot a beautiful shot.
Azar ran faster than the defender and scored with a left-footed goal after passing Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the par post.
Liverpool fight Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, Indonesian disaster authorities reported Sunday morning.
Many people were reported to have been buried in the wreckage of a 7.5-foot earthquake on Friday, and a 20-foot-tall wave occurred, officials spokesman Sutopo Puro Nugroho said at a news conference.
With more than 380,000 people, Fallusie was covered in collapsed building debris.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was conducted this morning after the body of a woman was found at Merseyside Beaconhead.
His body was found dead at 7:55 a.m., 44, at Grayson Muse on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police strongly urged people who had seen or heard anything in the area to help.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I'm going to call someone who's seen or heard anything suspicious near John Street to contact us.
I will also appeal to those who may have important information in our investigation, especially taxi drivers, who may have something in their Dashcam videos."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a resident of the Beaconhead area and was found inside the property.
Friends who knew the woman arrived this morning to ask where she had been found.
Police say they are in the process of guiding the victim's close relatives, so the investigation is ongoing.
A taxi driver in Grayson Muse attempted to return to his apartment, but police said no one could enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he said nothing.
Residents are told it will take several hours before they are allowed to enter.
One officer was told that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
She repeats, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police cars are outside the line and another is outside.
Many police officers stood within the block of the apartment.
Anyone with information can contact @MerPolCC by DM, calling 101, or mentioning Crimestopper at 0800 555 111 to log 247.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament becomes the most recent monument hit on the line of ‘New Writing History’
Its expulsion may be a poetic definition of his talivian destruction of many of the British cultural and religious relics produced by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell League described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Federation, said: "The current debate over the elimination of statues was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue outside Westminster Palace would be the target.
The destruction of the British civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell, perhaps wrong, was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Sonnycroft’s remarkable reproduction of Cromwell is a historical record of a 19th-century public opinion that still many people believe is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph, "Chromewell was more recognized in the late 19th century than today as a defender of the monarchy against external pressure.
Whether it will be a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
Precisely, the conflict of the mid-17th century produced the development of our country, and Cromwell is a memorable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as a guardian of the monarchy are also memorable and memorable.”
A pig kills a Chinese farmer.
In southwestern China, a farmer was attacked by a mayor’s pig and killed, local media reported.
The man, identified only as a "comforter" in the province, was found to have been cut off and died, and was covered in blood near the piggy cage in the market in Liupanshei, Guizhou province, reports the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a pig with a vaccine on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin to the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell fifteen pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw him dead, and the next pig found our door open.
He said there was a big blood stain on our mouths.
A forensic examination confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs had harmed and killed a farmer.
"My cousin's leg was severely damaged in Pitu," said Guiyang Evening News, a cousin known as Mr. Wei.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the comfort or possession of his cousin.
As police gathered evidence at the scene, the market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on a person.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig on a farm in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband, causing a fatal injury to the man.
Ten years ago, 650 pounds of pigs pushed a Welsh farmer, which continued until his wife chased them.
After a farmer in Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were unusually belligerent, but that the taste of blood could play a ‘push’ role.
“They’re just joking.
They are young children, they are very curious... They are not trying to hurt you.
We have to have enough respect for the pigs," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's Residue Brings Extensive Heavy Rain to the North-West US
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves into a cold sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is planning to flood northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa is currently 85 mph wind, Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Organia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the basalt will take shape in the Pacific Ocean and begin moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula with a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin sending deep tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical moisture interacting with the approaching pressure vessels will create a wide range of heavy rains in the Southwest region for a few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous outbursts, mudslides, and desert landslides.
Deep tropical moisture will make it rain anywhere from two to three inches an hour locally, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that two to four inches of rain will fall in the Southwest, especially most of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of a sudden flood due to the rapidly deteriorating weather.
The advice to take the risk of walking through the desert is very bad.
Heavy rains can make the river strong, impacting the canyons, and thunderstorms will bring about ferocious winds and flying dust.
The coming barrage will bring heavy rains to parts of the Southern California coastline.
It is likely to rain more than 1.5 inches in total, causing the collapse to float and slide the trail.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
The sporadic tropical shower will begin approaching Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday before it becomes more widespread on Monday afternoons and Tuesdays.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners throughout Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic gets colder, there will be extreme crossovers across the United States, but the regression line will be on the warm side.
Sometimes this results in extreme temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday is a good day for the U.S. temperature.
There was a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and the Des Moines of St. Louis and Iowa.
After a few days, the summer heat will continue and expand.
In many parts of the Central and Eastern United States it is expected that in October there will be a wide 80-degree heatwave from the southern plains to the northeastern part.
New York City can average up to 80 degrees on Tuesday.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average in early October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Caverno's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched an interesting testimony from Six Television Network on Thursday from U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Caverno and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, Christine Blashford.
In the meantime, political deadlocks continued with stations blocking the regular formation of Friday's final run. This was an agreement negotiated by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who will conduct an investigation into the charges for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent convinced at a high school party that Kaberno was trying to get her drunk and take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
Nielsen had average ratings from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other broadcasters, such as PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, did not show up immediately.
Nielsen usually has some problems counting the number of people watching while working.
Given this, it is similar to the number of people watching a playoff football match or Academy Award.
Nielsen reports that Fox News Channel, a strong supporter of the Onion hosts, outperformed all networks that averaged 5.69 million viewers throughout the day of the hearing.
ABC's audience was 3.26 million for the second time.
According to Nielsen, there were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC, and 252 million on CNN.
I didn’t pay attention after the hearing.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican side stated that he would side with Cavano, when he tried to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearings, protesters yelled at him on CNN and CBS cameras.
When he received the gilta, he was broadcast live on CNN for a few minutes with his eyes down.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“You think he’s telling the truth?
“When many women are left powerless, you have power.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and that he would have to talk more at a committee hearing before the elevator closed.
When the Judicial Council voted on whether Kavanaugh should be appointed to the entire Senate meeting, the cable and broadcast networks all covered the live broadcast.
However, Flake said that the FBI did so on the condition that they would investigate allegations against Kavanaugh in the following week, which minority Democrats had been urging.
Flake was somewhat convinced in a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Koons and several members of the Senate, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was power, because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May threatened the national interest in her plans to leave the European Union and accused critics of “playing politics” with Britain’s future in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 for a Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson, his former foreign minister, said the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their own tariffs was “totally absurd” and strongly attacked her so-called scheme for Brexit.
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dythion Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Twenty-year-old Dythion Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, Beton Luge said in a statement.
Officials released videos of Simpson's confrontation with The Sims, and police said The Sims had lost his glasses while fighting.
Police said they had acquired the glasses at the scene and found Simpson’s DNA in it, CBS Affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted that Wade had been fatally shot.
The lawyer said his bail was set at $350,000.
The Eastern Beton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound that penetrated the neck from the head.
The Louisiana State Police Task Force, the Police Scientific Investigation Institute, and the Southern University Police and the locals are helping to investigate the arrests.
LSU player manager Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for “implementing perspectives and justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six-inch player was raised by his father, Wayne, who also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City.
The volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached its southern neighbor from the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned that Mexicans would fall away from the volcano on Saturday after volcanic activity began in the crater and erupted 183 times over 24 hours.
The center observed several whistling sounds and weak earthquakes.
A photo posted on social media showed a car windshield covering a thin layer of ash in a city near Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geologists have discovered that after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017, volcanic activity rose 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
This volcano, known as Dongo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists face off on Independence Day
Protesters in favor of independence met with riot police, and six people were held in Barcelona on Saturday. Thousands of people took part in a rival demonstration to commemorate Catalonia's first anniversary of the split.
A group of separatists, masked by the riot police, stirred up a black dust cloud in the streets full of tourists, bashing the police for eggs and throwing powder paint.
There were also riots with the police who used the batons to stop the fighting until late that day.
For more than a few hours, a group of unifying protesters chanting "Spain, be forever," in favor of independence, shouted, "Let's not forget, let's not forgive."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries from the demonstration, local media reported.
Although it was considered illegal in Spain, tensions still persist in the separatist Catalans' claim to independence after a referendum on 1 October.
Although the voter turnout was usually low for separatist voters who boycotted the vote, voters overwhelmingly opted for independence.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop a vote at a polling station in the area where there was a violent conflict.
A group of pro-independence groups spent the night outside on Friday to prevent police from protesting.
Protests continued, but were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus, a 68-year-old electrical engineer who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they were able to vote, but we are in a situation where we are trapped."
Even if they managed to win the local elections last December, the Catalan parties sought to win this year's momentum with some of the best-known leaders in detention waiting to be tried for the role of putting themselves in jail or organizing referendums and subsequent declarations of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records police-assisted demonstrations on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“It’s going to get tougher,” he said.
Oriole Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who was held in pre-trial detention late last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate for the European Parliament elections is to vehemently criticize the degeneration of democratic values and the oppression the Spanish government has shown us,” he said.
Londonderry: Men are arrested after their homes are picked up by cars
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, were arrested for carrying a car into Londonderry's home.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Creskent, Bali.
Captain Bob Bloomings said the doors and buildings were damaged.
At some point, the crossbow may have been shot by a car.
Menga Strikes Livingstone Wins the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal saved Livingston's victory
The promoted Livingstone shocked the Rangers with the second loss of 18 games to Steven Gerrard as manager of the Ivorx club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved the difference when Gary Holt's team took second place to Hibernian.
Gerard's side remains undefeated in this season's Premiership, and will face the leaders of the Harts, who will be 8 points behind next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will meet Rapit Bin in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues the unbeaten streak of six league games with Holt, who still experiences defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses the possibility of winning direct visitors
Holt's team should have been much ahead of them before they scored because of their directness, which is causing all the problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson had to break through to the front of the goal, and Alan Lisgou had to slip over to meet Craig Halket's heading goal and allow him to break through.
The hosts were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cater to visitors in set-piece situations.
And that was the only way to get a decisive goal in.
The Rangers allowed free kicks, and Livingston approached and broke through the holes with Deklan Gallagher and Robinson to help Menga score in the middle of the zone.
As a result, the Rangers seized the ball, but found it impossible to break through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was greatly relieved.
Alfredo Morelos managed to get a save from Kelly, but the pattern continued into the second half.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, who moved quickly in another Livingstone set play.
While Halket's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton and the two penalty kicks in the handball were in vain, the cross continued to come to the Livingston area and continue out of the goal.
Livingstone's "Experience"
Tony Macaroni Arena BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont
Livingstone's wonderful performance and results.
To a man, they excelled at continually exceeding expectations with this growth rate.
Their style and organization has changed little since returning to the top team, but the big ball will have to go back to Holt, who brought the team to life.
He had many heroes.
Halket excelled in controlling well-organized defenses, and Menga did not stop between the vibrant Conor Goldson and Joe Warrel.
The Rangers were inspired.
As long as they enjoyed their time with Gerard, they dropped the bar well.
Their last ball is once they - and it's like a weather alarm to the Rangers who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast, there was a smile and blue sky.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was not enough to establish relations between NATO allies.
They had disagreements over human rights, freedom oppression and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest number of expat Turks.
Police gave security reasons to stop the 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up to meet the president nearby.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including a large number of Kurds, also spoke out against Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him.
The confrontation between the two demonstrations reflects the dissensions of the German Turks who admire Erdogan as a hero and those who sell him as a dictator.
Dunford Road Accident: Cyclist Dies in Car Crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 a.m. in Summer Time, England, on a complex road southeast of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and an emergency medical worker was at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place a few months after another cyclist died in a car accident on Childrens Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
The London Police Department said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road was closed, a bus detour route was prepared and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: 6 prison guards injured in riot
Six of the guards were injured in a riot at a heavily guarded men's prison, she said.
On Sunday, a riot broke out at HMP Long Latin Prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 UK Daylight Time.
Professional "Tornado" guards are dealing with this disturbance, involving eight inmates and one comrade.
Guards were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
"Specially trained prison workers are being deployed to deal with ongoing incidents in HMP Long Latin," a correctional office spokesperson said.
Six of the workers were treated for their injuries.
We do not condone the violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be summoned by the police and imprisoned for longer periods of time."
HMP Long Latin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the UK’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, after an attack by a prisoner, it was reported that the head of the prison had received hospital treatment.
And in October last year, a riot officer was summoned to cope with the severe commotion of an employee being attacked by a billiard.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (benefits drought areas)
It's rare for tropical cyclones to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week, with Hurricane Rosa conserving energy, crossing the southwestern desert and causing the risk of a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings in southern and eastern Arizona, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to land late on Monday and head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service tweeted: "Since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or tropical cyclone within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest model from the National Hurricane Center in the U.S. predicts a 6-inch Mogollon Rim in Arizona and a 2- to 4-inch rainfall in the rest of the world.
Other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will be down from one to two inches, with a total of four inches of rain.
Where there is no threat of sudden floods, Rosa’s rains may be a good thing for the region to suffer from drought.
Floods would be a very serious concern, but some of this rain could be beneficial, because the southwest is currently in a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, at least second-most dangerous."
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa lands and crosses the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa is still in the hurricane century, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
This storm will encounter cold currents in the Pacific, weakening their strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with a tropical storm century on Monday afternoon or evening.
With so much rain coming down across Mexico, there is definitely a risk of flooding.
"A total of three to six inches of rain is expected in Sonora, northwest of Baja California, up to 10 inches," weather.com said.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico in a tropical storm, and by Tuesday morning she will reach the Arizona border with a tropical cyclone, which will then travel through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
The main danger expected from Rosana's remains is a lot of rainfall that will be sprayed in the deserts of Baja California, Northwestern Sonora, and the Southwest United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening floods in the desert and landslides in the rocks and mountain regions.
Midsomer Norton assault: Four suspected attempted murders
Three teenage boys and one 20-year-old man were arrested in Somerset for attempted murder.
The teenage boy was found on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsummer Norton at around 4 p.m. UK Summer Time.
He was transported to the hospital in a "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, Avon and Somerset police said.
A police officer is investigating whether anyone has a cell phone photo proof of the situation before the incident.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered From Democrats’ “Anger and Evil”
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the impolite and outrageous strategy of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says Kaberno is suffering from the Democratic “malignity and anger” during the appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying that she was raped when they were teenagers decades ago by Christine Blasey Ford.
Ford also testified against her at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people "saw the extraordinary power and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Judge Cavanaugh’s confirmation vote is one of the most brilliant justice ideas of our time, and one that confirms that he’s a legal expert with a great record of public service,” he told the West Virginia support crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment during the midterm elections, talking about the importance of the Republican turnout.
“We have five weeks left until one of the most important votes of our lives.
I wasn't running, but I'm really in a hurry."
“That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats are moving toward “resistance and obstruction.”
A senior Republican adviser told CNN that the House’s most important procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment would be expected to take place by Friday at the latest.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia predict hundreds of deaths and deaths
A powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people, officials said on Saturday, leaving many stranded in huge waves that ravaged the beach.
When the six-meter (18-foot) wave that swept so many people to death and destroyed everything in front of them hit the shore at dusk, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the tsunami threat came up, people continued their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately. They ended up being victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPM, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trees and houses. The tsunami hit everything on the ground," said Nugro, adding that the tsunami crossed the high seas at a speed of 800 kph (497 mhp) before hitting the coastline.
Some people have climbed trees to survive the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 facilities in Fallu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Services Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, their legs distorted, and a mosque surrounded by water.
It shook the city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were detected by 2.4 million people in one region.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement on Friday that the energy generated by the massive earthquake was 200 times greater than the intensity of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
The topography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have expanded the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive," and he said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that 540 people were injured and 29 missing, and that the bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of the collapsed building.
Nugro said the victims and damage would be larger along the 300-kilometre (190-mile) coastline north of Fallu called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication from Dongala was "completely paralyzed without any information," Nugro said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that Red Cross staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," the Red Cross said.
Authorities were accused of notifying them of Saturday's tsunami hitting the city of Fallu, but officials said the wave was triggered within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you can hear a man upstairs in a building sounding a warning about an approaching tsunami to people down the street.
A water barrier hits the beach and wipes away buildings and cars in a matter of minutes.
Reuters could not immediately acknowledge this scene.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communication around Fallu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate their rescue operations.
Military authorities have begun sending cargo planes carrying relief supplies to Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but refugees are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for relief purposes only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit a shelter in Fallu on Sunday.
More than 800 Indonesian tsunami casualties have skyrocketed.
It's not very good.
World Vision employees from Donggala were safely transported to the city of Palu, where the staff were evacuated with a tarp installed in the office courtyard, but they passed through a devastating scene along the way, Doseva said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's not very good.
When relief groups made a dark move to start the disaster rescue gear, some complained that expertise was preventing foreign aid workers from going to Fallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, supplies and personnel assistance from abroad can only be provided if the region is declared as a national disaster zone.
The announcement has not yet been made.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international aid, but it's not there yet."
With the arrival of a second night in Fallu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, families and friends of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be a miracle to reverse the desperate story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days by her mother's body.
Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono trained two paragliding players who were missing in preparation for the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mandagi and others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his trainees.
"As a senior in paragliding, I feel a deep sense of responsibility," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how the story was told in the paragliding world after the news of the collapse of the Loa Loa Hotel. He sent a desperate WhatsApp message to the participants of the beach festival in Fallu.
His message only got one gray check mark, not a blue check mark.
"I don't think that means the message hasn't been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling ATMs at Newport on the Levee
According to news released by the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 while Brink’s staff filled in the money at an ATM in Newport on the Levy on Friday morning.
Officer Dennis McCarthy wrote in a report that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in an amusement park and preparing to transfer more money.
While he was taking his place, another man stole a bag with money that should have been carried “jumping off the back of the Brink staff.”
According to the report, witnesses saw multiple suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Yes
Rapper Kanye West changed his name.
Speaking to Twitter on Saturday about the change, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was sometimes nicknamed Ye, and used the name as his eighth album title to be released in June.
The change came before the appearance on Saturday Night Live, where we expected to introduce a new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and the word in the Bible means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking with radio host Big Boy about his album title.
“I am you, I am us, and this is us.
It's an example from Kanye, which means one thing: our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known for a variety of things, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, is also living without hyphenation or capitalization.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use its military against its citizens
As Mexico's presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador approached the 50th anniversary of his brutal retaliation against the students, he vowed never to use his troops against the citizens.
López Obrador promised in Tlatelóco Square on Saturday that he would "never use military force to oppress Mexican citizens."
On October 2, 1968, in that square, the army opened fire on peaceful demonstrations, killing as many as 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movement began to take root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth with monthly grants and more openness from public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead the younger generation to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for research in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investigator and AI expert with experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement is generally followed by the announcement by various ministries of the U.S. government as the U.S. lacks an AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced last year its plans to become number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., an AI research budget doubles, which is a good start, and we're going to find the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding will double the chances that the next big AI performance will be created by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBCD this week.
Lee’s book, “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in Face++, one of China’s most promising AI companies.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States, and later he became executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
Lee is aware of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would be to help identify the next prophet.
Researchers in the U.S. often say they have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that gets rid of academic leaders, it's a company," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired experts from universities to study AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes could help strengthen AI development activities in the U.S.
"I think that the American permanent resident should be automatically granted to the AI Ph.D.," he said.
China's State Council announced China's next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances academic institutions in a similar way as the U.S. National Science Foundation and other government agencies give a little bit of money to U.S. researchers, but China has a low quality of academic work, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners in industry and academics, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a plan called the AI Nextra.
Speaking of NSF, NSF currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been in motion for months.
Macedonians hold a referendum asking whether the name of the country has changed.
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens held a national general election on whether to change the name of Macedonia to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece that prevented efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province called Macedonia, maintained that its northern neighbor's name claimed ownership of its territory, and was opposed to joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments saw a compromise based on the new name proposed in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would weaken Macedonia's ethnic character of Slavs as the main population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the general election, and counter-movements questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the general election to be valid.
The question on the ballot for the general election is: "Do you support the approval of consent with Greece and NATO and EU membership?"
Proponents of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek access to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that young people can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although not legally bound, a sufficient number of members of Congress said they would follow the results of the vote in order to ensure the outcome of the vote.
The name change calls for more than two-thirds of the vote.
The Central Elections Commission said no complaints were reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stopped at just 16 percent, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote for my children, for our position in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a Scottish voter.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, along with his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, voted to vote on a referendum on Macedonia's national change to open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
In front of the parliament in Strumica, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, was preparing a small performance, lifting up a chair in front of a tent set by people who would oppose the general election.
"We're in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join, not through the back door," Kavardakov said.
"We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If you don’t want us to be accepted into Macedonia, you can turn to the other side, like China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Joyev says NATO accession will bring more support to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large number of people will be kind, because more than 80 percent of our people are kind to the EU and NATO," he said after the vote.
He said the “prosperity” result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released Monday by the Macedonian Agency for Public Opinion Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters said they would vote in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of course, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, one more vote is needed at 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum will be seen as a serious blow to the pro-Western government for the first time since it was acquired in May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes care of the entire Brighton field to score.
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly beat Brighton in a 2–0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero scored a strangely easy 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders, then jumped into an open field.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender until he ran away from the edge of Brighton's penalty box a few more times.
Then he found Stirling and took the pass to his left.
The English forward used the first touch in the penalty box to give the ball back to Aguero. Aguero used his right leg to shoot to the right of the net to fight Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"I saw Aguero struggling with a problem with his foot," Man City director Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that actually happened.
At the time, we were lucky to have him.”
But in that Premier League game, the only person who gave the Sky Blues their first score was Sterling.
The goal happened in 29 minutes.
Aguillo was given the ball deep in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a ecstatic pass along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched several times before Stirling moved towards the distant goalpost.
Sky Blue Forward put the ball into the net before it slipped out of the bounds.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Hoffenheim and Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer Wants Spoiler vs. Rockies Game
With the Nationals excluded from the playoff debate, there’s little reason to lead to another start.
However, the most competitive shooter wants to take over the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff opportunity for the Rockies to win the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5–2 on Friday night, winning at least one wildcard spot, but the Rockies are still looking for a way to secure their first regional title.
"Even if we play with no results, at least we can step on the pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other teams are probably playing at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why would I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals haven't announced their Sunday start yet, but I'm sure they'll be thrilled to pitch to him in that situation.
The 34th shooter is going to throw the ball in a bullpen session on Thursday, and the Sunday is going to be pitching as usual.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher is 18-7 this season, scoring 300 strikeouts during 2.53 and 220 2/3 innings of ERA.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
While talking about the importance of Republican voters in the midterm elections, he spoke indirectly about the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, whom the president has appointed as Supreme Court.
“Everything we do is done in October.
Five weeks left from one of the most important votes in our lives.
This is one of the really, really big things, and I'm not running, but I'm really in a hurry, and that's why I go all over the place to fight for great candidates."
Trump went on to say, "You've seen this terrible, terrifying radical Democratic Party, you've seen what's going on.
And they've made the decision to use all the necessary means to regain power, and you've seen the malice, the disgust.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to attack to have power and control. What they want is power and control. We're not going to hand them over to them."
He said Democrats are moving toward “resistance and disruption.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, despicable, disgusting and unbelievable."
He mentioned the Congressional Judiciary Committee, referring to Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic senator, whose name was heard in the audience by a giant wildcat.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you see that document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no. I'm waiting. It's a really bad body language. It's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a national party.
This is unacceptable to those who tell their own stories.
It was hardly surprising that Momentum activists in my local party voted to discipline me.
After all, I was the last person to be told I wasn't welcome in the ranks of Labour MPs, and that's all we were told to do.
My congressman's colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, because she had endured anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for the conflict of disciplinary consent with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically, is similar to Jeremy's disagreements with previous leaders.
On Friday, in the guide to the Nottingham East Labour Conference, he said, "We want the talks to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years as a local Labour MP, that Friday night’s board meeting was exactly that.
Sadly, today, many meetings do not reflect the social climate, and the promise of a "more kind and more respectful" policy has been forgotten if that promise has even begun.
It is increasingly clear that different perspectives are not being accepted by the Labour Party, and that all opinions are being evaluated by whether the party leadership will accept them.
This started just a moment after Jeremy became head of state, and my colleagues, who I thought had a political view of, started to expect me to change my opinion on national security issues or EU single market issues, or to take a political position that I would never agree with.
Whenever I speak in public, the accusations against centrists, regardless of what I'm saying, saying that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party, and asking for my next job to be eliminated, have been filled on social media.
And it's not my own experiment.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who fight daily against sexual or racial discrimination but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current regime is how various insults have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a big party, and every "unconfident" change in consent or selection makes the party more intolerant.
I've heard a lot of advice over the last two years that if you avoid engaging and don't make your argument too strong, it's going to be okay.
But that's not what I was trying to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, I’ve been angry at the government’s indifference to let the general school classroom literally fall apart, and I’ve sought to fight for better public service for those in need.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in the House has ever been confused about my policy position and where there is conflict with the current leadership.
For those of you who started Friday's agreement, all I can say is that when the country is headed for Brexit, which is hurting families, industry and public services, I can't understand the desire to waste time and energy trying to show loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the only message I really want to convey is not for the House Momentum, but for my electorate, whether it's Labour or not, and I'm proud to be able to contribute to you, and no threat of drop-off or political self-interest will stop you from doing what you believe is best for all of us.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Heading to the Undefeated Air Normal
Two final attempts were missed in the final, but there is no doubt that Air deserves to win the great and interesting Tennant's Premiership that day.
The ten men who were defeated were at the forefront.
In the end, it was as good a defense as Peter Mulch's better chance of entertaining everyone by moving to the home side.
"We've done a lot of testing with games, and we still haven't lost, so I'm happy," he said.
Melos' Robin Christie said, "They did a good job on the air. They had a better chance than our team did."
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's Tri and Frazier Climo's Convert Shoots led the air. However, as Scottish captain Rory Hughes received a yellow card and the game leaned towards the Warriors, Mellos allowed the opportunity, and Jason Baggott took over.
Klimo stretched out to allow Air to lead in the penalty. Just before half-time, he scored, then turned into a solo tri, saving the Air from a crisis of 17-5.
But Melrose began to do well on the second half, and Patrick Anderson's tri and ship's convergoals made him a five-point hit on the Riway.
He was transferred to a stretcher, and when the match resumed, Eyre made a sharp difference in his score through the Tri of Stafford McDowall and Clemo's Convert goal.
Air's captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and Melrose, after intense pressure, put in additional personnel in exchange for Bruce Colvine's tri-convert goal.
But back to the home side, and when Stuan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackled with a ballless climo, MacPherson touched down ahead of the Air Maul.
Klimo added a convergoal. He scored again when Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and Gregor Henry sent home the fifth tri.
Still Game's star appears to be preparing for a new career in the food industry
Steel game star Ford Kieran appears to be preparing to move to the service business after being identified as the head of a licensed restaurant business.
This 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show co-starred and written with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be their last show on the show, and Kieran seems to be preparing for a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the Scottish Sun data suggests that Kiran was involved in Glasgow's "promotion of the restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, wants the court to reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the seagull base, decorated with chairs in La Paz.
In a public building, there's a sea-colored flag.
From the Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases are inscribed with the following motto: "The sea is ours, of course.
It’s my duty to get it back.”
Across Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memories of losing the coastline in a resource conflict with Chile in the 19th century are still vivid, so we're eager to sail the Pacific Ocean one more time.
Since Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation, that hope has probably reached its peak in decades.
"Bolivia is full of acceleration, unity and calmness, and of course we have positive expectations for the outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on a big screen, hoping that the Bolivian side will side with the argument that Chile is obliged to negotiate an independent exit to the sea after decades of talks in the Hague.
Bolivia’s charismatic Indigenous President Evo Morales, who faced a controversial fight for next year’s reelection, also relies heavily on Monday’s ruling.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific," he said in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will reluctantly decide to side with Bolivia, and that doesn't change much.
This Dutch-based United Nations organization has no power to grant Chilean territory, and it says it will not determine the outcome of the possible story.
After hearing about this in the last argument as "not complex", the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months away.
Far from being the cause of Bolivia, the past four years may be coming back.
“The problem of approaching the sea is now being used by the Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales' offensive words are clearing out the favors of the remaining Chileans, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will hold talks at the right time, but it will be very difficult to continue the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
It was strangely expedient that former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the head of Bolivia in The Hague, refused to accept the idea that the decision was made by the court.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to open up new horizons in its relations with Chile” and “the 139 years of disagreement with mutual interests will end.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the sea as a political tool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to show that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that North Korea would never destroy nuclear weapons first if it could not trust the US government.
This was said at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue to deliver on the commitments of the leaders of both countries during the summit in Singapore.
Mike Pompeo appeared to be working with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore to resume a nuclear policy that had been deadlocked for more than three months.
It said the U.S.’s opposition to continuing sanctions and declaring the end of the Korean War was a “dream” that ultimately tried to subdue North Korea.
The U.S. government is cautious about agreeing to the declaration if North Korea does not first have a meaningful demilitarized movement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about whether North Korea is serious about giving up its weapons because it sees them as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo will visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump’s second summit.
Paris fashion show reveals huge headwear from the city centre to you on the latest line
If you want to zoom in on your hat collection or completely block out the sun, you don’t need to look at anything else.
Designers from Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a number of hilarious oversize hats at the dazzling SS19 Collection runway in Paris Fashion Week.
Very unrealistic hats swept through Instagram this summer, and these designers are bringing incredible creations to the stage.
A prominent work in Valentino was a beige hat with a broad head, decorated with feathers covering the model's head.
The other oversized accessories were jeweled watermelons, witch hats and even pineapples, but they weren't designed to get your head out.
Tom Brown has also revealed his bizarre mask selection, which is the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the masks of various colors had sewn lips, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than Ottkuturra.
One piece resembles a scuba diving rig complete with snorkels and goggles, while the other piece resembles a melted ice cream.
And if you're going to continue to be a huge fashion voice, you're in luck.
Style observers predicted that a giant bonnet could reach you from the center.
The oversized hat was hot on the hill of La Bomba, a straw hat that everybody used, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand, with its passion fans, followed by a very unrealistic hat that became an issue amongst social media and sent other giant creations to Catwalk, a straw beach bag that was almost as big as a model in a bathing suit with a bag.
The bunt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and white ladder handle tops, was a striking piece of the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacques MÃ©ssÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©sÃ©s Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see a wide hat and a beach bag arriving in the city centre next summer. The designer has made such an impact that it’s hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential as a global citizen
Private schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and performance retention leads to outstanding test results in 2018, which means more personal and comprehensive success in sports, art, music, and other areas of endeavor.
Represented by the Scottish Commission for Private Schools (SCIS), many of these schools, with 30,000 students, are committed to providing the best possible services to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for adult education and higher education, their chosen careers and their status as global citizens.
As an educational institution that can plan and implement a customized school curriculum, we continue to see modern language as a popular and desirable choice among schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "Speak in the language he understands, and it will go into his head.
If you speak in his language, it will be engraved on his heart.”
This strongly indicates that when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
This year’s most recent test results show that the language is at the top of the league table with the highest pass rate in an independent school.
68% of foreign language students have achieved a high grade of A.
According to data gathered from 74 SCIS member schools, 72% of students received A credit in Mandarin, 72% of German-speaking students, 69% of French-speaking students, and 63% of Spanish-speaking students also received A credit.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Language is now considered as a subject choice, with aspects such as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculum.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17% of employers reported a lack of language skills due to the fact that their employers struggled to fill their absences.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more career opportunities in the future that require language, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter which profession you choose, anyone who learns a second language will benefit from the practical benefits of this lifelong ability in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts multilingual people ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults, 75 percent of them are not good enough to speak a foreign language, and French is the only language spoken at a rate of 15 percent of double digits.
That's why it's so important to invest in language education for kids today.
Speaking multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance to find meaningful jobs.
Within Scotland, the languages taught by each school will vary.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, and others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin and Japanese, as they look forward to 2020.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be many languages to choose from within an independent school, along with a faculty member who is an expert in this area.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment in which they can prepare children for anything in the future and provide them with the skills they need to succeed.
In the global business environment, language cannot be denied that it continues to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a fait bien le fire.
John Edward is a member of the Scottish Independent School Board.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his first start in the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers manager Luke Walton announced that James would play in the pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided whether he will play for a few minutes.
On the official website of the Lakers, Walton said, “It will be one minute or less, 48 minutes or less.”
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is expected to play for a limited time.
Following the practice earlier this week, James was asked about the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
"We don't need pre-season games at this stage to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Meeting Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's the first meeting of President Trump's five upcoming meetings next week, including a visit to friendly neighborhoods like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the signing vote to fill the Supreme Court vacant on hold, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as the Republican Party is on the verge of losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia wheeling rally is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube online below.
Trump appears to be dealing with this week’s hearing of Chief Justice Brett Caverno, who has been nervous about allegations of sexual misconduct while the FBI is investigating, delaying the Senate’s approval vote for up to a week.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans who are ahead of the November election gain some power.
As a result, the Trump campaign center is aiming for five next week’s rally “to empower volunteers and supporters as much as the Republicans want to protect and expand key areas in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who called for anonymity, told Reuters that “the president will visit as many states as possible during his busy campaign season because congressional control is so important to his agenda.”
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling will "bring supporters to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the press in Pittsburgh will report."
It is the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to assist West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, "It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president has to come to power the vote."
The 2018 Ryder Cup: USA team shows the courage to fight to not lose hope for Sunday singles.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's game may have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swaying pendulum of propulsion is a completely invented sport concept, but it’s a concept that players truly believe in, and there’s nothing more meaningful to it than a competition like this.
So where is the momentum now?
Jordan Spieth said, "They went ahead by six points and now they're four, so I think I've gained a little bit of momentum."
Of course, Europe is 12 to 4 points ahead of the game.
As Spies said, Americans think the sails are a little bit windy, and that's enough to keep them up. In particular, Spies and Justin Thomas not only play together all day, they each have four to three points.
Spence was deadly from tee to green, and he's ahead of that.
As his round progressed, the celebratory screams grew, and when he and Thomas lost twice after two games, they hit an important putt and tied the game 4.
His putt, which led them to win the 15-day game, made him scream like he believed the American team had not yet withdrawn from the game.
Spence said, "You have to dig really deep and worry about your game."
Now all these players are gone.
18 holes make a score.
The only player to score more points than Spies and Thomas in the last two days is Francisco Molinari, Tommy Fleetwood, and the Ryder Cup.
A strange but lovely couple in Europe can’t go wrong with four to four.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't see it on Saturday afternoons, but they avoided it on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and Fridays at 9 a.m.
Such a flow and the energy flowing between the two from this tumultuous crowd will ensure that they are the winners on Sunday, and that no player is more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to prevent a potential European victory as the sun goes down at Le Golf National.
Both at the same time in different halls.
But the story of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson teamed up with Alex Noren to create a short piece of the morning's hero Sergio Garcia.
With one view and two doubles in Hall 9, the Spanish and the Swedish players were left alone as long as they could never get out.
But on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of the hall.
Pobol and foursome are fun to watch closely because of the interaction between players, the suggestions they make, the suggestions they don’t make, and the ways in which strategies can change in a moment.
Europe has done better as a team so far and has been at the forefront until the last day, but this game has shown that the U.S. team has had the guts to fight some of the most questionable battles, especially on the part of the U.S. side.
European 10-6 ahead to the final of the Ryder Cup
Europe will be very favourable to the final of the Ryder Cup after a 10–6 win over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-sum matches.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, Le Golf National led the excitement by winning two wins against Tiger Woods, who are struggling to add four points to their record so far.
The European team with Thomas Bjorn overwhelmingly dominated the undefeated U.S. in the early morning ballnet game to re-launch the trophy that had been stolen from Hazelstein two years earlier and took the series 3–1 ahead.
The United States had a lot of resistance in both games at the Four Islands, but they were not able to fill the heat.
Jim Furyk’s team can keep the trophy if they get 8 points in 12 singles games on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to score four points in a row, but after a stormy weekend, he and Molinari are the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four Bowl, they beat the brilliantly matched Woods and American god Bryson Dechambeau in a much stronger 5&4.
Woods, who played two games in a row on Saturday, has often played brilliantly, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in both Pobol and Possum, losing seven in a row.
After taking a break for Four Bowl this morning, Justin Rose returned to his partner, Hendrik Stenson, and lost to world No. 1 and No. 3, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, 2&1.
Despite the sunny and windy days in the south-west of Paris, Europe did not have them in its own way.
Major three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for American players on Saturday with two points.
They won 2&1 overwhelmingly against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Pobol, then returned and lost the first two holes in Pobol, defeating Polter and Rory McIlroy 4&3.
Although Puriak's team only has to draw to secure the Cup, it is only the second time in Ryder Cup history that the team has returned from a four-point single.
But after two days of second place, Sunday’s counterattack seems to be more than that.
North Korea unilaterally disarms without trust is "impossible"
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions are deepening its distrust of the United States and there is no way for North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But we don't see a corresponding response from the United States."
“Without trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security, and there would be no unilateral disarmament in such a situation.”
Lee reiterated North Korea’s familiar dissatisfaction with U.S. resistance to “step-by-step” denuclearization, which North Korea would be compensated for by taking incremental steps, but his remarks were significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea did in the past.
Lee said during the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore last month that Kim Jong-un pledged to commit to "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and that Mr. Trump was referring to a joint statement that promised North Korea security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The U.S. has also rejected calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
Lee said the U.S. "claims 'denuclearization first', raises pressure levels with sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way, and opposes the 'horror declaration'."
“The awareness that a sacrifice can bring us to our knees is the dream of those who are ignorant of us.
“But the problem is that our continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Lee did not comment earlier this week on Chairman Kim and Trump’s plans for a second summit at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Chairman Kim and President Moon over the past five months. "If the party to this denuclearization was Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a stalemate," he added.
Even so, Lee’s tone of speech was distinctly different from last year’s United Nations General Assembly when Trump, the “demon president,” identified Kim as the “rocket man” who committed suicide, and said it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with a North Korean rocket.
Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year as a brave man to take action against disarmament, but said much work must still be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said, “It doesn’t matter if it’s two, three, or five months.”
China and Russia insist that Pyongyang should be compensated for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Sunday that "we must vigorously continue to enforce the Security Council sanctions until complete and final verified denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to end funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo said he would meet with Lee separately at the United Nations General Assembly on Monday and then return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not smooth.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea called him a "gangster-like demand."
In a meeting with President Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the U.S. takes a “response action,” it will dismantle its missile sites and nuclear sites.
He said Kim delivered "corresponding measures" in Singapore, including the security measures promised by President Trump and the move to normalize relations with the United States.
Harvard students take classes to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University helped all undergraduates sleep better in order to fight the growing macho culture through caffeine-addicted 'nights'.
One scholar found that students at the world’s number one universities were often ignorant of the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Harvard Medical School sleep medicine professor Charles Czeisler, Brigham Women's Hospital, devised this course, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do you only listen to this teaching when you're in your senior year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph in an interview.
Opened for the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleep habits can help their academic and athletic performance, and how important they are to promote overall happiness.
Professor Paul Barreira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School, said the university has decided to introduce this process as it finds students experiencing severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has images of dormitories where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, books to hear about the effects of caffeine and light, how exercise is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of bedtime routines.
In another chapter, participants heard how prolonged sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Campus maps and interactive icons make participants think about their daily lives.
“We know that it won’t immediately change the behavior of our students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking."
He added that there is still a culture of pride in ‘swimming through the night’, and that the ever-increasing pressure on modern technology and students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The lack of sleep, he said, puts the brain in a state of hunger mode, making it a secret weapon for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety in order not to gain weight.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old studying chemistry and physical biology in California, helped Professor Chaser design the course last year as he took one of his first lectures at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue courses across the campus.
The next step is to require all graduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competing institution.
Kaisler recommends that students should consider setting an alarm when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' that electronic screens and LED lights emit, which can lead to sleep problems by breaking the rhythm of your cycle out of its normal state.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal puts Gerrard's men down
When Steven Gerrard lost 1-0 to Livingstone with Dolly Menga's strike, the Rangers suffered another expeditional depression.
The Iverocks tried to record their first win after a 4–1 win over St. John's in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Radbrooks Premiership leader Harts by eight points, which was out of control after Gerrard's second defeat in only 18 games.
Menga was filled seven minutes in the first half, and the lack of a line-up of Rangers' inspirations didn't seem classy.
The Rangers fell to sixth place, but Livingstone climbed to third place, only to be followed by the Hibernian in the goal.
And since Calum Spence had to be treated for damage to his head after a distant object, there could be a bigger problem with the Rangers.
Gerard made eight changes in the side that swept through the past year to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Libby 11, who scored the Harts last week, and he would have been delighted that his well-dressed outfit suffocated their opponents every time.
The Rangers may have taken control, but Livingston did more when he had the ball.
They managed to get Menga's first strike through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but Midfielder had to score in just two minutes, grabbing his big shot.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found the captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow stabbed him in the back.
The Rangers gained control, but there was more hope than belief in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to face a 15-minute penalty when he clashed with Steven Thomson, but referee Steven Thomson appealed to Colombia.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former Iverox goalkeeper, suffered a headache with Lassana Coulibaly's heading and tamed Ovie Ejaria's strike.
Livi’s 34-minute opening may have been against running the game, but no one can deny that they deserve it for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle the deep Jacobs setpieces.
Scott Arfield didn’t respond when Declan Gallagher scored against Scott Robinson, and stayed calm by choosing Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which gave him an almost immediate effect when a wing player scored in Morelos, but Kelly managed to make an impressive run and stop on his line.
But Livingstone took a long pass after Lisgo and Halket had a long connection, and kept sucking up the audience to play exactly the kind of games they enjoyed.
Holt could have extended the lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up to stop Jacobs before Lisgo headed in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton asked for a penalty against Jacobs, but Thompson turned away.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
On a page of the "Sunday Morning" yearbook: September 30, 1882, today, 136 years ago, and... the day the German physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger eventually developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive materials, an invention that led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the center of science, has also become the center of popular culture in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as cowboy scientists who may not be anywhere else:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
With these earbuds, you can actually hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radiation of minerals."
Evans: "Hey, it's definitely exploding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill’ malignant cells.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as targets for treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
And they can 'see' and re-inject proteins that are common in many cancers.
Experimental vaccines have shown promising results for a variety of cancer patients.
One woman who was given this vaccine, which teaches her immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab, "seeing" the proteins common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of many types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzowski.
A similar approach to "teach" how to take immune cells out of a patient and target cancer cells was effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West started accusing pro-Trump after wearing a MAGA hat and starring in SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West performed on Saturday Night Live to praise U.S. President Donald Trump, and was hailed in the studio after revealing his intention to run for president in 2020.
That evening, after wearing the "Make America Great Cap" and singing the third song, "Ghost Town," he continued to complain with a loud voice toward the Democratic Party, and continued to support Trump.
"When I talk to white people quite a few times, they say, "How can I like Trump, he's a racist?"
“If I had been worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started out as a drama starring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not broadcast, West's epic footage was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with that post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes about what he had written on his head.
“They hurt me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go outside wearing that hat."
They have tormented me!
And they say I’m in a place where I’m sinking,” the Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Would you like to see where I'm submerged?" "I'm going to put on my Superman cape, because that means I can't tell you what to do.
Have love," he said.
Variety said that his commentary has eluded the audience at least twice, and SNL cast members seem to be baffled. One said, "The whole studio has been quiet."
West was later recruited as the successor of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has puzzled a lot of people by playing a song called "I Love It," which he dressed up as a Ferrier bottle.
West gained support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the mob."
But on Twitter, talk show host Karen Hunter said West was simply "who he is, what a wonderful thing it is."
“But I have chosen not to reward anyone who thinks they are embracing and injecting harmful ideas into our society by purchasing his music or clothing or by supporting his “art.”
He is free.
We are too,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "A Man Now Officially Known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change their name and follow Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and Fiddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg named Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and later became an artist known as Prince.
Suspected murder in Belfast restaurant bust case
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident occurred in Balikhamore.
The defendant will appear in court on Monday in Belfast.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington strikes male beauty
Kit Herrington is known for his role in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series 'Game of Thrones' as Jon Snow.
But the 31-year-old broke the stereotype about the macho hero, saying that those roles in the film often mean that young boys feel they have to struggle to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed something was wrong and questioned how to address the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old co-star with his Game of Thrones, admitted that he felt "very strongly" about dealing with the issue.
“I feel personally, quite strongly. Where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
In terms of the problems we see now, what have we been taught when men were growing up?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its masculine character.
He went on to say, "What is innate and what has been learned?
What makes young boys, on TV and on the street, feel like they have to be men?
I think that's one of the biggest problems of our time. How do we change it?
For surely something has gone wrong with the young."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play "Game of Thrones" or a sequel at the end of the series, saying he was "finished with battle and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will appear in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of the filmmaker and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, and that drama gave me my future family and life here,” he said.
Rose played Igrit, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the basis of Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China says new patients surge 14%
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in this country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new events are transmitted through sex, and this shows that they are different from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the Chinese health authorities said at a meeting in Yunnan that the number of people living with HIV in this way has almost reduced.
But in China, the number of people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 every year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a prominent issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was banned in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is rampant.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to universal access to HIV drugs in an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters Denies Employees Who Leaked Data From Republican Senators and Blows "Dangerous Lies" and "Fear"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters accused her staff of posting personal information to three Republican senators on Wikipedia on Saturday.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed the claim was being reported by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that it was "a lie, a lie, a more mean lie."
The information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch.
The information was reported to have been posted online by an unknown person during a U.S. Senator’s hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh nominees in Capitol Hill on Thursday.
The leak happened after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address confirming the origin of the post was associated with Waters’s office, and Hill disclosed information from a Waters employee.
Waters said, "This baseless claim is completely false and absolutely false."
“The members of my staff, whose identity, privacy and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims, have never been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely and never a lie.”
Waters' statement was criticized online, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer agreed.
Fleischer wrote, "I'm angry at this negativity."
“This suggests she doesn’t have the restraint to become a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not rebel.
They should not doubt the motives of the accusers.
They have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democratic critique of Judge Caberno, who was criticized by critics for seeming so upset at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who ran to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal."
Waters said in a statement, “We are warning the appropriate authorities and law enforcement about such fraudulent claims.”
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified," he continued, "They can be destroyed by all my staff and they will be held liable for all dangerous actions."
Johnny English Strike Re-Review - Lowly Rowan Akinson Spy Parody
Finding Brexit crisis in any new film with a current British perspective is traditional, and it seems to apply to the resurgence of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise, which started in 2003 as Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the Johnny English ribbon.
Will a joke that mocks itself on the subject of how clearly we are garbage become a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, face-worn, incompetent Johnny English deserves to be able to create something new, more than anything else, a wide-ranging comic creation designed for the region where he has non-English-speaking filmmakers.
Of course, despite his bizarre appearance, he looks like a young clusso with a youthful charm, has Mr. Bean's dash, and donates a note to a chariot of fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He also appeared once in a now-forgotten Barkley Card TV commercial, based on the original traveler and internationally mysterious Akinson, which confused his career.
There are a couple of great moments in this Johnny English outing.
I liked Johnny English getting into the helicopter, briefly hitting his helmet with medieval armor and rotor blades.
While Atkinson's talent for physical comedies is apparent, humor feels quite understated and strangely exaggerated, especially since "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible are now proudly offering comedy as a material.
The humor seems more like it's aimed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's humorous thinking is not as creative and focused as Atkinson's silent films are in a persona called Vienna.
The permanent thematic premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated the UK’s secret spy web network, revealing the identity of every British agent in the field, which, unfortunately, left Kevin Elden disappointed in his small role.
Emma Thompson does her best with this Jun-Terissa May character, but there's not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since all active spies are at risk, she will have to reactivate someone who is retired.
And that means that Johnny English himself is now employed as a principal in some luxury facility, but he does informal classes on how to become a disguised peacock.
English rushes back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant Bow, played by Ben Miller again.
Bowe is now married to Vicky Pepperda, a passionate athlete and submarine commander.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who had horribly erred in the Queen's Secret Service, became active again after encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful yogi, Opelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of collapsing due to the demands of charismatic technology billionaire Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bowe embark on their comical journey of play, disguised as waiters, set fire to a luxurious French restaurant, smuggled on a luxury yacht in Volta, and English creates the mess itself when they try to use a virtual reality headset to get used to the interior of Volta's house.
For that last scene, the whole scene definitely went, but as cheerful and tumultuous as it was for all of it, it was like a children's TV.
Pretty decent.
And, like all Johnny English films, can the British film industry give Rowan Akinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour Brits work four days a week, but deny that they plan to get paid for five days.
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan to see Britons working four days a week but getting paid five days a week.
Labour is reportedly hoping that corporate bosses will give workers one more day off with the savings they've earned through the AI revolution.
It will see employees enjoy a three-day weekend, but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plan to give the country to the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: "We expect a policy review to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but working four days a week is an aspiration consistent with the party's approach to economic readjustment and the party's overall industrial strategy."
As the Green Party pledges its four-day workweek during the 2017 general election, Labour will not be the first to support such a proposal.
But that desire is not supported by the entire Labour Party at this time.
Labour spokeswoman said, "The four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Cabinet minister John McDonnell used Labour meetings last week to shape his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell says the public service has decided to take back power from "no-face directors" and "producers."
The plan of the Shadow Cabinet also means that the Labour government may be ‘credited’ for misbehavior, meaning that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to get their entire share back.
He also planned to place workers on the company’s board of directors and create a comprehensive ownership fund that would provide employees with 10% of the equity of private companies, which would result in an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in "60 Minutes" on the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s indictment investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI’s findings could shake Republican senators out and draw their support.
Scott Pelley, "60 Minutes" correspondent, asked Republican Sens in an interview on Sunday, and John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham questioned whether they could find anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I told him I was talking to Mr. Cavanopan to go to the hearing.
I called him after this, and he said, 'Did you do that?'
He was firm, determined, and clear.”
But Graham’s vote seems decisive.
He said, “I’m determined about Brett Caverno, and that’s going to require a lot of criticism.”
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett stubbornly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she named couldn’t confirm it.
36 years.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what have you done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host an equally important mission: the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring incredibly impressive stars with an end to global poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy with performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizenship Festival has expanded the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against poverty.
To get free entry to the event (unless you pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a series of tasks and "actions" such as volunteering, emailing representatives of the world, making phone calls or providing other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goals to end poverty.
But how successful have the past 12 years been for the Global Citizen?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a real way to persuade people to ask for action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” that makes a real difference when you sign or tweet an online petition?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters and is pursuing other goals.
These measures have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group cited 390 commitments and announcements that began with the action in early 2018, at least $10 billion of which have already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on approximately 669 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a partnership between British investors and practitioners to help children reach their full potential. The agreement promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social inequality of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, nutrition power ambassador at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for a project called Nutritional Powers, which could provide nutrition interventions to five million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website asking, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous road. Sometimes we will fall or fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement, we will win, because together we will become more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe will be performing at this year’s New York City event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "closing" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
As Washington’s investigators quoted, Washington could rely on the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy, including in the Middle East, from hitting the market, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Jinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, which is operated by invitations from particularly legitimate governments, is an excuse to open up a new energy market.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is to mediate energy, as they do in the southern parts of Europe and Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has the ability to open ocean lanes with our Navy, block them if necessary, and keep their energy out of the market,” he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization in the United States that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer."
He compared U.S. treatment against Russia and Iran, and noted that Russia and Iran are virtually the same.
He referred to Russia as "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, and said that "the economic choice for Iran and Russia is to exploit and replace the fuel somewhat."
The statement comes from the Trump administration’s mission to replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers, with increasing liquefied natural gas exports to Europe.
To this end, U.S. President Donald Trump and other Trump administration officials are persuading Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “forerunner” in Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Node Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the U.S.’s bitter opposition to the business is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September, said: “We share the perception that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers.”
The U.S. position sparked a German backlash that reaffirmed its commitment to the plan.
The German Industrial Association (BDI), a leading German industrial organization, has called on the United States to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Industrial Association (BDI) President Dieter Kempf said: "There is a big problem when the third country disrupts our energy supply."
Elizabeth Warren Says She'll "Try" to Run for President in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider" running for president after the 25-day midterm election.
In a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government," she said.
"After November 6th, I will be thinking about running for president."
Warren told City Hall that he was “taking this county in the wrong direction.”
She said, “I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.”
Warren has made unshakable criticisms of Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Caverno candidates.
Warren tweeted on Friday: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
But a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of “possible” Massachusetts voters say Senators shouldn’t run.
Thirty-two percent supported such a move.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy, with 38 percent supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
Other notable figures discussed in the 2020 presidential run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Track Palin enlisted in Iraq in September for a year.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
She told a support group for Donald Trump, “What my son is going through, what he’s coming back, I can empathize with PTSD and other families who feel some of the wounds our soldiers have inflicted.”
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, and they wonder if their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the rest of the military, have any respect for the country."
Police spokesman Dan Bennett said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with obstructing reports of domestic violence against women and possession of weapons while drunk.
18 states support challenge for new asylum policy in D.C.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gangs and domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts submitted a court opinion of friendship to Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who oppose the policy.
The full name of Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on federal policy in August has not yet been revealed.
She said her partner" and her gang members' sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the U.S. asylum seeker as a country with a large number of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala where gangs and domestic violence are rampant.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Board’s 2014 decision to allow illegal immigrants to apply for asylum to flee domestic violence.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal, and international law."
“According to federal law, every asylum application must be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such state law violates that principle,” the court said.
Lawyers also argued that the policy of refusing to enter the U.S. economy in lawsuits harms the U.S. economy, making them more likely to be entrepreneurs and “providing the necessary labor force.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to allow any more asylum for victims of family abuse and gang violence.
Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement that "people who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, members of certain social groups or political opinions may be exiled."
Asylum was not meant to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even all the serious ones.
Desperate rescue effort in Palu as the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said she was "very nervous" when she comforted a boy who had erupted in a devastated city shelter in Fallu.
Every hour an ambulance brings in a body.
There’s not enough clean water.”
Residents were seen trying to get back to their destroyed homes and retrieve everything they could find from their submerged belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder bones, were forced to rest outside the Falhou Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the open air.
As the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter, his eyes widened.
“I didn’t have time to save myself.
"I think I was sucked into the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that the family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then I was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and children.
I just want them to be safe.”
US Ambassador Accuses China of Bullying With Propaganda Advertising
The U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda a week after China's official newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. daily for the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday at the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest selling newspaper, about subsidies paid by China Daily after he accused China of trying to intervene in the U.S. congressional election on November 6.
Trump’s accusations that China was trying to interfere in the US election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters in an interview that Washington was a new phase of pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise in order to promote trade, China and the United States are currently locked in a escalating trade war that has witnessed tariffs on each other’s imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were intended to strike out Trump's Republican Party and other state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Chinese and American experts.
U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad and Iowa Governor, a major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In a statement published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China is now "double its harassment by sending propaganda ads to our own free press."
"The Chinese government is using the tradition of freedom of speech and expression that the United States values by putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register while spreading propaganda," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in every newspaper stand here in Beijing, we will find a limited voice of opposition, and given that the press is firmly in the hands of the CCP, we will not be able to reflect at all the disparate opinions that the Chinese have about the economic trajectory that might be of concern," he wrote.
He added that his article "avoided being published by one of China's leading newspapers," but did not mention any newspaper.
Republicans alienate centrist female voters who spearheaded Kavanaugh Debacle, analysts warn
While many of the top Republicans support and advocate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Cabano, who has been accused of sexual assault, analysts have warned that the upcoming midterm elections will be a backlash, especially for women.
The emotions surrounding this have been extremely heightened, and most Republicans are already showing that they want to hold a vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told Congress about an article that was published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted whether the FBI’s last big attack on the investigation would be enough to appease the outraged voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday. They won't forget it tomorrow, or even in November," said a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, as the Republican Party, which is taking control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to enforce Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters entered the Senate corridor and shouted, "November is coming!"
"Democrat enthusiasm and morale are falling out of popularity," said non-partisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg on the news site.
“People are saying they’ve already hit high numbers: yes.
But it could be even higher among non-floating female voters in the suburbs, especially those who don’t like the president but often don’t vote, and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29.”
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, an analysis was also made that Republican lawmakers could follow up with a backlash if they did so.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele said earlier this week, “This is a confusing situation for Republicans.”
“It’s not just about a committee vote or a final vote, it’s about how Kavanaugh is going to stand trial, it’s about how Republicans have dealt with this issue and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, head of the U.S. Priorities USA, an organization that helps elect Democrats.
But according to Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, Americans seem to disagree somewhat about who to believe.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41 percent of respondents say they believe Ford’s testimony either for sure or perhaps, while 35 percent say they do.
Thirty-eight percent said they thought Kavanaugh would have lied during his testimony, and 30 percent said they would have lied about Ford.
The FBI is investigating charges filed by at least one defendant, Deborah Ramirez, as well as Ford, following Flake's investigation, The Guardian reported.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was drunk when he was 17 and assaulted her.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Plans to Launch New Internet to Acquire Google and Facebook
World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in this tech legend, Inrupt is based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to it.
Berners-Lee joked in a solo interview with Fast Company that Inrupt’s intention was “world domination.”
He said, "We have to do it now."
“Historical moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data stores" or PODs.
This can include contact lists, task lists, calendaring, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user what kind of information they have access to.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea for Inrupt is to provide the company with resources, processes and appropriate technology to help everyone use Solid products.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some of the on-site developers who have contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether all their business models will introduce a complete change that will be fully upgraded overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post to Medium on Saturday that Inrupt's "mission is to provide an ecosystem that helps protect commercial energy and the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Lab.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: World War I Victoria Crusader Ceremony
During World War I, the only British church priest who won the Victoria Crusade as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown for more than 100 years.
Lieutenant Bernard Van received the award on 29 September 1918, when he attacked Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had been awarded the highest honor of the British Army.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled the monument at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was a "sacred symbol" that revealed his grandfather's award exactly 100 years later.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through a very deep fog, with the concentrated artillery and machine guns."
He later hurried up to the line of fire, leading the line forward as the "greatest warrior", and then dashing to the field artillery, knocking down three detachments.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to follow, but it’s simple.”
He and his older brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed wreaths after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"It's a great honor to be part of the parade," says Michael Vann, adding, "The courage of a true hero is being demonstrated by the support we receive from so many people."
MMA fans who spent the night watching Bellator 206 get Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you’ve watched Bellator 206 all night long, but you’ve been rejected for seeing major events.
The San Jose program featured 13 games, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face-to-face, viewers in the UK were devastated when the news turned to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed, especially after waking up early for the game.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to children's comics as "a sort of pathological joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, said, "At 6 a.m., we had to switch to a children's program because the content wasn't appropriate, and that's a government regulation."
"Peppa pig," "Yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will plan their schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, we probably can fix it,” Corker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday, with our time, which is Monday, their time.
But we're studying it.
Believe me, when it changed, a lot of letters came and went, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was the government's problem.
I promise it won’t happen next time.
We're going to cut it down to five games, not six games as usual, and we've tried to do too much for our fans, and we've gone over it.
unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' About Sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his grades, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking of Lauren Laverne’s first ever radio 4 Desert Island Discs, she said she had no hesitation in talking about gay rights that could give others “hope.”
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular on the long-term show, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a castaway on Laverne’s first show, Daley said she felt “less” grown up than everyone else “because liking men and women wasn’t socially acceptable.”
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less and differently have been real things that have given me the strength and the courage to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," and that he didn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to stop punishing homosexuals.
He said that he was lucky to be able to live without wavelengths, and that he spoke freely because he wanted to give hope to others.
The winner of the three world championships, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker who met in 2013, said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man.
Daly said she was married to a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but the age difference was never a problem.
"When I went through so much at such a young age," he said, "he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, and he found it difficult to find someone who had similar highs.
The couple became the parents of a son called Robert Ray Black in June, and Daley said his "overall perspective" had changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I should have won a gold medal."
“There’s something bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daly said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'The father can't be in the front row.'"
“I was holding his hand while he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing did I acknowledge that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daily won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I knew this was something I’d dreamed about my whole life: diving in front of home audiences at the Olympics, and there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
It was also his first song that resonated with him in his physique up to the Olympics – Proud by Heather Small – that inspired the choice and still creeped him out.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Good conditions on Saturday at the Ryder Cup (Mickelson)
Phil Mickelson of the United States sets a record for the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will have to turn around to avoid being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson played for the 12th time in this tournament, held every two years, and was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's bowling and possum.
As he has often been there for the United States, instead of being at the center of the action, the fifth major winner spent a day between being a cheerleader and working on the pitch to correct what helped him.
The 48-year-old, who has never been the most straightforward driver in his prime years, is not ideal for tight Le Golf National courses where long-standing roughs routinely punish wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn’t overbearing, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this Sunday in Game 9.
If the Americans, who started with 12 singles games and dropped four points, start well, Michaelson's game could be absolutely critical.
Furick didn’t say much, but he expressed his confidence in the man.
“He fully understands his role today, taps my back, looks around my arm and says he’ll be ready tomorrow.”
“He has great confidence in himself.
He’s a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I could not have imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that was the way it was solved and the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Sunday's record for most riders' cups, Nick Faldo.
It could mean the end of the rider's cup's career, which was not comparable at all to the height of his personal record.
Mickelson is making seven rounds of 18–20, but Furick says his presence has brought some loopholes to the team.
"He's funny, he's kinky, he's tactful, he likes to tease people, he's a nice guy in a team room," he explained.
“I think it was fun for the young players to beat him this week.
He offers more than just play.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead could soon be gone
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a large lead from the Ryder Cup to the single on the last day can easily turn into an uncomfortable match.
Dane made his debut in a 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team led by the Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the American players, but managed to cross the finish line with only the narrowest score.
"You keep reminding us that we had a big advantage in Valderama; we had a big advantage in the Brookline we lost and the Valderama we won, but we just won," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 and 10-6 at the Le Golf National competition on Friday and yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You’ll be bored tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until you get the point.
We have a goal, and that’s what we’re trying to do to win this trophy, and that’s where it’s focused.
I've always focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know all too well what's on the other side. It's the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had played on a tough golf course, and he added: "I will never get ahead of this.
Tomorrow is someone else.
Tomorrow is a personal show, and that’s a different one.
It's nice to be with your partner when things are going well, but when you're going out on your own, you're being tested to get the most out of your golfing skills.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players, and you're going to do your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he’ll have to go and get the best from himself.”
In contrast to Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will find his players so that they can do better individually as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth or Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
After becoming a member of the winning team at Bruklain, Furik himself stood in a big turnaround on the last day, as Europe took away "Medina's Miracle" and became a loser.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw had gathered players until the last day in 1999, he said, "I remember all the damn words."
“There are 12 important games tomorrow, and you want to start as fast as you saw in the Bruklain, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum flows in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-games.
We lined up to him and sent men out in a way that felt like we could do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with facing Rory McIlroy in the first place, and European players such as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter joined in the first half.
Bjorn said of the singles selection, "I think it's all over, so I've followed this order."
The new German warships are acting again
The German Navy's newest escort had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but the faulty systems and snowballing costs would not get there until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the approval of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" lead wire of the Baden-Uerttemberg-class new frigate was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery problem plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Urttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be the replacement for the old Bremen-class frigate.
Powerful cannons, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technology, including radar reduction, infrared, and acoustic signatures, are expected.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period, which means you must be able to deploy the latest frigate on your home port for up to two years.
However, the continuing delay means that the state-of-the-art warships that say they allow Germany to project electricity abroad will already be outdated by the time they enter the service, Die Zeit said.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was a hot topic last year when the German Navy officially rejected the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had delivered the ship back to the shipyard.
Little is known about the background of the return, but German media have cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that have rendered warships useless when deployed in combat missions.
Software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Urttemberg-class ship would be run by about 120 sailors, half of the workforce of the old Bremen class.
It also found that the ship was dramatically overweight, which reduced performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000t "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as a similar class of ship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware flaws, the price tag of the entire project, including crew training, is also a problem.
It has increased from 2.2 billion€ to 3.1 billion€ ($36bn).
In light of the recent warnings that Germany’s naval forces are declining, the challenges that grip the most recent frigates are particularly important.
Earlier this year, Reichstag Defense Commissioner Hans-Peter Bartels acknowledged that the Navy was actually “depleting a deployable ship.”
The official said the old ship was disbanded, but no replacement ships were offered, so the problem is blowing up like snowballs over time.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Uerttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust intercepts the secret creatures of bats.
A new study from a private estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use this landscape when they hunt for food.
We hope that this discovery will help rekindle the behavior of unique flying mammals and guide future conservation efforts.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow not only brown-long-eared bats and Daubento bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, but also common soprano and soprano Pipistrel.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats and what species are doing it.
Habitat maps and reports will be generated to create a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the NTS’s natural conservation advisor, wants the results to reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management tasks such as pastures and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They're under threat from construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be dangerous, as this not only causes the chemical processing of paper and building materials, but also attacks on pets.
Bats are not really blind.
But when it comes to catching food due to nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
With more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, NTS takes bats very seriously.
10 experienced professionals regularly conduct research and inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The group has designated a special reserve for bats at the site of the Threb estate in Dumbledge and Galloway for the first time in Scotland. Eight of the ten bat species currently inhabit the area.
According to the manager of David Thompson's estate, it is an ideal habitat for bats.
David also said, "There's a very suitable area for bats in the Thrive."
"There's an old building, an old tree in the ground, everything you need for a bat.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, and while we're protecting them in these territories and other areas, we're going to understand what it takes to thrive."
If one bat breeding site is destroyed unintentionally, it is important to check for the essentials before treating it as a habitat, as a result of which about 400 female and baby bats could die.
Currently, bats are protected, and their destruction of breeding grounds, including killing, harassing, or obstructing them, is legally prohibited.
Elizabeth Ferrell, who works for the Scottish Bat Protection Agency, asked for her active participation in the bat protection effort.
"We still have to figure out a lot about bats, and we don't know how the various species that inhabit Scotland thrive."
Ronaldo denies allegations of sexual assault and is expected to sue a German magazine through his lawyer
Cristiano Ronaldo countered that sexual assault allegations against him were "fake news" that "partners used their names to manipulate him for fame."
Ronaldo's lawyers plan to sue German news magazine Spiegel, who reported on his alleged sexual assault.
Portugal and Juventus striker Ronaldo was charged with sexual assault on American Catherine Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo paid $375,000 to demand the silence of women after forced sex.
A few hours after the alleged sexual assault was reported, Ronaldo, 33, rebutted the allegations of sexual assault to 140 million followers via Instagram Live.
"No, it's not true.
What was reported today is completely fake news," Ronaldo, who won five Ballon d'Or awards, said while staring at the camera.
“They’re trying to use my name.
It's not new.
I'm trying to be famous by mentioning my name, but the media is always asking me what's going to be the issue in this way.
I am very happy and everything is going smoothly.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer accused Spiegel of reporting allegations of sexual assault, saying it was "unacceptable reports of violating the private sphere of life".
Ronaldo's attorney, Christian Certz, said that in recent years, "this has been one of the worst cases of personal rights infringement, and Ronaldo has filed a claim for damages that is "requiring a reasonable amount of moral damage and the severity of personal rights violations."
The alleged sexual assault occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court of Nevada, Ronaldo and Majorga met at a nightclub, climbed into the hotel room where Ronaldo was staying, and then Ronaldo attempted to coerce and subdue anal sex.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo knelt down after sexual assault and said he was "99% good" and "1% bad".
According to the documents submitted, Ronaldo admitted having sex with Majorga, but insisted it was due to an agreement.
After the sexual assault, Majorga said she went to the police station to report and filmed her injuries at the hospital, but agreed to a deal later because she was "feared to be rehabilitated" and "feared of being publicly disgraced".
Majorga, now 34, said she wanted to nullify the deal because she was still traumatized by sexual assault.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid when he was accused of sexual assault, and this summer he was transferred to a strong Italian team, Juventus, for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will leave’ car manufacturers behind and regret
British Industry Minister Greg Clarke said that the UK's position, which has been a leading player in automotive manufacturing since Brexit, will be impaired, and it will "leave you and you will regret it."
Mr Clark also told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, production will be temporarily suspended at a factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We have to come up with an agreement," Clark said.
According to Japanese automakers, carrying out a Brexit without an agreement could result in delays in crossing the border and even holding back while reducing jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Oris and Avensis, exported 90 percent of the 150,000 cars produced last year to member states of the European Union.
“I think if the UK takes Brexit at the end of March, we’ll have to stop production,” said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and others, have expressed anxiety about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will be achieved.
BMW, for example, said it will close its mini-factory in Oxford next month.
Looking at the automakers’ announcements, they are deeply concerned that there will be massive disruptions in the supply chain if Brexit is carried out without an agreement.
The Toyota production line does not use the "JIT" method, which is to build a vehicle on a stack of parts, but rather the order method at that time, so the parts needed to produce the ordered car arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU member states.
If the UK takes Brexit without a deal on 29 March, there will be a problem with the parts crossing the border, leading to delays and shortages in the supply of the parts.
It is impossible to store more than a day's worth of stock in a Toyota factory in Derbyshire, so production will be discontinued, the factory official said.
Clark noted that when Prime Minister Theresa May plans a future relationship with the EU, "we must be specific about ensuring that we don't go through unnecessary verification procedures at the border."
"We desperately need a deal. We need to come up with the best deal to capture not just the successes we see, but the opportunities that Brexit has to offer," Secretary Clark said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Given the concerns of Toyota as well as other automakers, we need to be able to ensure that the supply chain configurations that have been successfully operated so far are in the future."
Toyota warns that it is difficult to predict how long it will stop production, and that in the long run, additional costs will only reduce jobs due to production competitiveness.
Peter Sobalis, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years, said union members were worried, adding, "In my experience, a job that was once lost has never been restored."
A government spokesman said: "We will implement an accurate and reliable plan to better establish our relationship with the EU in the future."
The White House said Trump would postpone talks with Rosenstein again.
As the hearings of Supreme Court Judge Brett Caverno continue, talks with sensitive President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be "one more week", a White House spokesperson said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Russian presidential intervention, Russian relations with Trump, and the work of special counsel Robert Müller, who is investigating the possibility of the president disrupting the future implementation of justice.
In American politics, rumors have raged for months about whether Trump’s dismissal of the Justice Department would make Mueller’s independent investigation impossible.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a wiretap device to take out conversations with President Trump and firing President Trump under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that the report was true.
Despite reports of resignation, Rosenstein went to the White House on Monday.
Instead of resigning, he announced that he would meet with Trump on Thursday at a United Nations meeting in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to "spouse" Rosenstein, and postponed the meeting so that she would not clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused Kavanov of sexual misconduct, all testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the case of Cavano sexual abuse for a week, and the entire Senate vote was postponed.
Sarah Sanders Trump appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said: "The date of the meeting has not been set, and it may be done this week, but it is possible that it will be postponed to the next week, given all the issues currently taking place in the Supreme Court.
But the White House will continue to consider the situation and let reporters know what's up to date."
Sanders hasn’t held a White House press conference since September 10, so some reporters may be back.
Chris Wiles asks why.
Sanders replied that he didn’t like the “eye-catching act” of TV reporters, but that he “does not object to the fact that it is eye-catching.”
President Trump and journalists will have more opportunities to meet in person.
"Unlike our previous president, who had a formal question-and-answer session, President Trump is going to be honest about the matter," he added, "and we're looking at the figures without providing any specific evidence."
The press briefing said, "Wouldn't it be much better if the reporters had a chance to ask the president himself instead of me?
The White House is trying to have frequent opportunities for dialogue and has actually had a conversation in the last few weeks. Now, in a press briefing, you can talk directly to the president of the United States," Sanders added.
President Trump has been regularly asked when he leaves the White House, has an open session with current employees, or has a press conference with the high officials.
It is important to have an independent press conference.
In New York this week, President Trump may freely explain why in front of reporters gathered at a bazaar.
Health Minister Sends Letter to NHS Scotland’s EU Workers on Brexit Fears!
The Minister of Health wrote to the NHS Scotland’s EU worker thanking him and wishing to continue working after Brexit.
Ms. Gene Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has decided to cover the cost of applying for resettlement status for EU citizens who are already working in the delegated public services sector.
“We have been negotiating with the UK and the EU for a short time during the summer, and we will be able to decide on matters as scheduled this fall.
But the British government is also preparing for Brexit without an agreement.
I know you feel very insecure.
Therefore, I would like to once again express my gratitude and appreciation for the work of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
Thanks to the valuable experience and skills of our colleagues from the EU and other countries, we have improved the quality of health care and provided more benefits to patients and the community.
Scotland is your home, and we hope you will continue to live."
Christy Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury!
Christion Abercrombie, who plays Linebacker for the Tiger team at Tennessee State University, went into emergency surgery last Saturday with head injuries in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, a senior coach at Tennessee State University, told reporters that he had suffered head injuries just before the mid-rest.
"Christion walked up to the rideline and immediately fell flat," Reed added.
Abercrombie was put on an oxygen mask and taken to the hospital for further examination before a trainer and medical staff put him on a stretcher.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris (WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vandbilt Medical Center.
Harris added, "We haven't yet heard about the type or longitude of the injury," adding that Tennessee State University knows when the injury occurred.
In his first season as a sophomore athlete, Abercrombie transferred from Illinois to Tennessee State University.
Before stopping the game, he took a total of five tackles and recorded 18 tackles in the season.
UK government imposes higher tax on foreign nationals buying property
Under the new Tory policy, foreign investors who purchase real estate in the UK will be charged additional tax and the funds will be used by the UK’s homeless.
This decision will attract young voters and cause a weak Corbyn to falter.
It will be taxed on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury wants to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign investors buying real estate in the UK will be subject to a higher tax rate and additional amounts will be used to help the homeless.
The move aims to promote a more affordable housing supply as a pledge and to deter the weakening of Jeremy Corbyn, who is supported by young voters, and to attract adherents.
The subject of the additional tax will be individual investors and foreign institutional investors who do not pay taxes to the UK government, and the funds collected will be used to solve the problem of the homeless.
If you buy a house two years ago or for rent, you will be subject to an additional tax of up to 3% on your current household tax, including a higher tax rate.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to add £120 million per year.
Foreign investors who don’t live in the UK buy about 13% of London’s new city property, which makes it difficult for the common people to set up a one-family home.
Because foreign investors spend most of their time outside the UK, many wealthy regions, especially the metropolitan area, are becoming "ghost cities".
A new policy was announced a few weeks after Boris Johnson announced that he would significantly lower the tax rate for young people if they bought a house for the first time.
He accused large corporations of raising property prices because they were grabbing land without developing it, and urged May to release the sanctions he imposed on affordable housing to correct "the broken British housing market."
Corbyn has continued to publish ground-breaking housing reforms, such as adjusting rents and ending the "failure" to leave.
They also want to give the committee more power over the construction of new homes.
He said, "Last year, I told you that I would revive the British dream of a better life for a new generation during my tenure as Prime Minister.
This means that we're going to get the broken housing market right.
The British government is open to anyone who wants to live, work and find shelter in the UK.
However, it’s not right for individual investors who don’t live in the UK or foreign business investors to easily buy real estate and for hardworking UK citizens to find a home.
The reality is that homeowners-owned dreams are getting further and further away, and more and more people are asking to sleep in poor environments.”
Jack Ross: "The ultimate goal is to coach Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "final goal" was to become a Scottish manager at the right time.
The 42-year-old Ross, from Scotland, is delighted to have promoted the North East club, which is currently in third place in the first division by a third and first place.
He returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season and then moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
Ross told BBC Scotland SportsSound: "As an athlete, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was a second-class player, and I couldn't climb any more."
“Since I was a kid, I grew up watching my father and the Scottish team play a lot, and there was always something that attracted me.
Running a successful club is the only way to seize the opportunity.”
Prior to Ross, Dick Adbokart, David Moyes, Sam Allardeis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo di Canio were the Sunderland directors.
Aloa Athletic's former manager said he could follow Ross, who successfully led the club's relegation from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, without fear.
"My goal now is to bring this club back into the Premier League.
When you consider the structure and facilities of this club, you should be part of the Premier League."
"It's not an easy task to return to the Premier League, but I may be the only one to say it was a success for the club."
Ross was an assistant manager at Dumbarton, where he coached only for three years after working for Harts's coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alois avoid being relegated to the third team and led St. Mirren to a championship win the following season in a relegation crisis.
A career at Clyde, Hartlpool, Fokker, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy, Ross said he was more comfortable now than ever.
As I recall taking charge of Aloa, I said, "That was a real turning point."
“I really believed that management was better than playing the game itself.
It may seem strange that I was playing well, had a pretty good life, and had the honor to move on.
But it was so hard to play.
I had to do a lot of things every week.
Every time I was in a game, I felt intense stress and pressure, so I thought management would be more appropriate for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, but I’m doing it now, and I feel most comfortable doing what I do best when I’m an adult.”
Full interviews with SportsSound on Friday, September 30 can be heard on Radio Scotland from 12:00 - 13:00 (Summer Time, UK).
Survey Results: Saturday afternoon at 5.30pm is the perfect time to drink a pint
As the heat rose, the British pub sales rose, but the franchise restaurant sales declined.
According to statistics, Ferb and Bar saw sales increase 2.7% in July, while restaurants fell 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, said, "As the weather continues to get hotter and the UK team at the World Cup touted unanticipated, July sales showed a pattern similar to the previous month's June (upperb 2.8), but restaurant sales dropped.
Food sales fell 1.8% in June and even lower in July.
To date, pubs and bars that primarily sell alcohol have seen the highest rise compared to the previous month, while restaurant sales have fallen.
The pubs that sell food don't have the same classics on the heap, but they're not as good as restaurant operators.
People want a light drink.
This month, liquor sales have risen 6.6 percent across pubs and bars, and food sales have fallen by 3 percent.”
According to Paul Newman, RSM Leisure and Hospitality Analyst, "We expect this to continue as we move forward in April.
Important social events and sporting events, including the weather, are the biggest factors affecting restaurant industry revenue.
It’s obvious that restaurants will continue to be tough, and the decline in previous year’s sales of 4.8% has fueled the cost problem.
"The heat of the heat in August was going to drop, and we'll know in time whether it's going to go up as it did in high school."
In addition to the new location, the total sales of pubs and restaurants were 2.7% in July, delaying the opening of the new location.
The Copper Pitch Tracker, which monitors industry sales in the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sectors, is setting the industry benchmark by collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 operating groups (with total sales of over £9 billion).
1 in 5 children have a social media account hidden from their parents
According to the survey, 1 in 5 children between the ages of 11 and 11 have a social media account with parents and teachers.
After conducting a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, the "Fake Instagram" page is growing.
There is a growing fear that sexual content will be published through the news.
20% of students say they have a “major” account with their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, said they have a social media account with adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that the number of students with "fake Instagram" accounts on Instagram sharing photos is growing rapidly.
There is a growing fear that sexual content will be published through the news.
Twenty percent of students have a young, "main" account that their parents will be happy with, and on the other hand, have a personal secret account.
A mother came across a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter asked other teenagers to "bomb" her.
According to a study conducted by the HMC (Headmasters' and Headmissresses' Conference), 40% of students between the ages of 11 and 18 have two accounts, of which half have secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “The fact that so many teenagers are trying to have their own space that parents and teachers can’t find online is alarming.
Eilid Doyle to represent "Athlete's Doctor" on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Commission as the flight manager to administer the annual General Conference.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beatty sees this appointment as a great opportunity to fully enjoy the extensive experience that Doyle has gained in international competitions over the past decade.
"Aleid is a highly respected figure in both Scotland and the United Kingdom, as well as in the athletics community around the world, and we now believe that joining the committee will provide more benefits for athletes," added Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm committed to delivering the players' doctors and I hope we can contribute to the development of the Scottish sport and contribute little to it."
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, an American who won two gold medals (two out of four) and is currently an expert on the BBC was forced to retire because he was unable to walk due to a chronic cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted, "A month ago, my brain had a stroke.
It was impossible to walk.
The doctor said it would take time to figure out how far he could recover.
It was really hard, but I was fully recovered and I had to learn to walk again, and today I'm going to do agility training.
Thank you very much for your message of encouragement."
Controversial breast-feeding ads online, compare breast-feeding women to cows?
When a breast-feeding manufacturer presents an ad that compares breast-feeding women to cows, there is a controversy online.
As the breastfeed manufacturer Elbe launched "the world's first wearable silent breastfeeder", the company announced a somewhat humorous music video ad expressing the freedom the new breastfeeder would bring to breastfeeding women.
Four women who recently gave birth to a baby, dancing in a hay-filled cow's stall, and the words "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I can't see the tail," and "I can't see the cow's breasts. This is my breast."
The chorus continues, "Let's squeeze the baby, we'll squeeze the milk, we'll squeeze the milk."
As the ads were posted on Facebook, there was controversy online.
With over 77,000 views, hundreds of comments, and mixed reactions to the video, many are telling the dairy industry that it is "dissolved."
"The use of cow's milk to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Just like humans, cows have to give birth and then give birth to milk. The difference is that they are separated a few days after delivery."
The elby accumulator can be attached directly to the inside of the underwear (elby/mother).
In another comment, he said: “It’s no wonder that this advertisement traumatizes breastfeeding women and babies.
Do you have any advice for women who do not have a baby?”
The other comment reads, "Unspeakable advertising!"
One woman admitted that the ad was "fun."
"I think it's a genius idea.
If I’m still breastfeeding, it’s something I want to have.
I felt like I was completely cow-fed every time I was abreasted.
It's a bit unusual, but it's a reflection of reality.
There is a saying, “Genius is a product.”
In another comment, he said, "I think it's a fun ad for breastfeeding women who think of themselves like a cow while they're at work or in the bathroom."
It’s not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
The women in the back of the ad said they danced with the axe in their bras.
The advertisement was based on the fact that many breastfeeding women think of themselves as cows when they are breastfeeding.
The elby shafts are noise-free, have no wires or tubes, and can be attached to the feeding bra, so it is possible to move freely, hold the baby, and even go out during the feeding.
"The Elbi Axis is a breakthrough product that needs to be brought to market," said Mother's partner and ECD, Ana Ballarin.
It simultaneously shows breast-feeding women and dairy cows, illuminates all of the problems associated with the breast-feeding, and shows in an interesting way how much freedom the new conjugator guarantees.
This is not the first time that the Elby oil tanker has made headlines.
During the Runder Fashion Week, two breastfeeding women walked the walkway in designer Marta Yakubowski’s clothes while wearing a breastplate.
Hundreds of illegal immigrant children are quietly detained in Texas border shelters
Although the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border each month has not changed significantly, the number of children who have been detained has skyrocketed, partly because the Trump administration has released ruthless hard drives, making it harder to connect children with their patrons.
In general, most patrons are terrified and unwilling to act because they are illegal immigrants and are more likely to be deported from the United States if they decide to take their children.
In June, the government announced that all adults involved with potential backers should submit fingerprints and share fingerprint data with immigration officials, raising the risk of deportation.
Last week, senior executive Matthew Albens told Congress that he had arrested dozens of applicants who had supported children without parents.
Seventy percent of those arrested later said they had no prior records.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors and their families are illegal in the United States and many are foreign offenders.
So we're going to continue to track down these illegal criminals," Albens added.
The U.S. Department of Defense says it has introduced new laws to appear in court within one month of the date of stay, instead of waiting 60 days to expedite the process for children.
In many cases, instead of going to court in person, video calling is used to answer immigration judges about their legal status.
If they are not supported, they will be immediately deported.
The shelter staff and the regime have reported in recent months that the longer the detention, the more insecure and depressed the children will suddenly become violent or attempt to escape.
Proponents said large facilities such as Tornillo are more concerned because they are more likely to overlook the emotional signs children are experiencing at scale.
If children are psychologically unprepared, or are unable to say hello to their friends, and are suddenly quarantined to the residence protection, they will experience more trauma than they already have.
U.S., France and Turkey demand immediate withdrawal from Syria
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who is the vice-president, said foreign occupation forces are illegally staying on Syrian territory as an excuse for counterterrorism, "to deal with it accordingly."
"Foreign occupation forces must withdraw immediately without conditions," the UN General Assembly said.
In Syria, Mualem claims that the “war on terror is over,” adding that since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have lost their homes.
The Damascus government added, “We will continue this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are completely uprooted by terrorist groups and all illegal foreign occupation forces currently stationed.”
The United States sent about 2,000 troops to Syria to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arabs, mainly against President Bashar al-Assad.
France sent 1,000 ground troops to war-torn Syria.
On the issue of refugees, the situation is now good enough to come back, and "some Western countries" have created irrational fears, accusing refugees of not being able to return home.
“I have asked the international community and human rights organizations to help refugees return home.”
“So we’re politically on the issue of what we need to deal with as a purely human rights issue,” Mualem said.
The United States and the EU have warned that they will not support reconstruction until Assad and his opposition agree to end the war politically.
According to the United Nations, Russia and Turkey have recently agreed to create a buffer zone in Idriv, the last rebel stronghold, creating an opportunity to promote political talks.
Thanks to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, the region of three million inhabitants could not be attacked by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and said he expects military operations to "destroy" the jihadi terrorists on the Nusra front associated with al Qaeda.
U.N. Ambassador Stefan de Mystura is expected to draft a post-war constitution and prepare for elections in Syria by the government and a new committee on the other side.
Mualem told the committee that the Syrian government should be limited to “examining the provisions of the present constitution” and not interfering.
Why Trump will succeed in re-election
With that logic, Trump seems likely to succeed on the premise that he does not retreat to impeachment or old age as many liberals wish before the end of his 2020 re-election term.
It will certainly be the most dramatic end of the presidential term.
At present, it is not possible to capture the signal of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's Golden Hour ratings have more than doubled to 1,500,000, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago. And MSNBC's "Rachel's Sell Show" attracted 3.5 million viewers during major newscasts, reaching number one on the cable channel.
Neil Baer, general manager of the ABC drama 'Designated Survivors', said, "This is like a fire that people are attracted to because they can't understand it." 'Designated Survivors' is the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the raid destroys the U.S. Capitol.
Nel Scobel, an age-old comedy writer and author of “The Cruel Truth of Collecting Only the Fun Parts and Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different theory.
Scobel thought of a taxi ride in Boston just before the 2016 election.
He told her he was going to shoot Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Scobel told me that the article replied, "Because Trump makes me laugh."
In chaos, there is value.
Of course, unlike everything on television, the plot from Washington can determine the future of v. Wade, the reuniting potential of immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Turning the channel is a luxury that only privileged viewers can enjoy.
Still, when Bob Woodward quotes his book Fear and uses “deep background”, and sees Paul Manafort’s $15,000 air jacket (Washington Post said it was a brazen outfit) and a panel of experts discuss what Stormy Daniels says about Trump’s, well, body, etc., it feels like it’s going over the edge of a well-educated citizen.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Phone Stars, commented on Trump's show: "The reason Trump's actions look like reality shows is because he feeds his viewers every day."
If you don’t see a single episode, you can’t miss it because it’s behind.
When I visited Mr. Fleis this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the northern shores of Kauai Island, but he was locked in his room while recording CNN and watching MSNBC.
He could not take a look at Brett Caverno's case against the Senate and the Supreme Court's fate on the day it was decided.

Foreign money, top-notch congressman's election midterms.
It's no surprise that money flows through District 17 in Pennsylvania, as two members of Congress are forced to fight for a seat because of the re-arrangement of the congressional district.
Because of the recent re-election of the constituency, Congressman Conor Lam, who won a special election in another district last spring, went on to compete.
Ram confronts current Republican Keith Rospus, who represents District 12 in Pennsylvania. District 12 is heavily overlapping with District 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January, the new map was unconstitutionally gerrymandered to the Republican taste.
The election campaign in District 17 sparked a cash struggle between the Democratic Election Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Election Campaign Committee (NRCC), a major political party financial ammo.
Ram became famous in March after a split in Pennsylvania's notable 18th District Special Assembly election.
The seat has been occupied by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the area by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats will be a little bit outnumbered.
U.S. support for China, El Salvador, back up
Diplomats have seen that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized China without a U.S. backlash.
Trump had a loving meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he put his hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials have decided to bring back the top of U.S. diplomatic missions in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and El Salvador, due to a recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, as stated earlier this month by State Department spokesman Heather Nauert.
In 2017, El Salvador received approximately $140 million from the United States for drug enforcement, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposal included the elimination of financial aid and visa restrictions, which would have been a painful experience for El Salvador, where unemployment and homicide rates are high.
As the internal meeting continues, North and Central American officials have agreed to postpone high-level meetings focused on security and economy similar to last year’s meeting, which appears to be progress toward preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively blocking the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was recommended to speak at a planned meeting in mid-October, which diplomats said would demonstrate the importance of the government's commitment to the talks.
And the three U.S. embassies quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any merciless transmissions or penalties.
A White House spokesman for Bolton rejected a statement about the details of the discussions described by the three U.S. embassies, two of whom agreed to discuss their internal decisions under the guise of anonymity.
External experts who were closely involved in the administration and likewise agreed to speak under the guarantee of anonymity confirmed their explanation.
Research History
The possibility of Trump’s obstruction of justice by special adviser Robert Mueller may be unavoidable. There is considerable evidence from the official record.
Mueller reportedly started an investigation to see if Russia had colluded with the Trump Electoral College when interfering with our election.
If Congress changes ownership, Trump will be charged with being responsible for the core of the case just before he stands in front of the electors in re-election, and may be a jury member of his colleagues.
This is a fantasy full of the word "if", and it does not mean that Trump's downfall is unconditional, nor does it mean that the same opponent in Europe will be.
Both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have options to determine the continuity of the situation.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to start a coup against Hitler, which would have been successful if the West had continued to resist Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia.
But we failed, and we took the opportunity to stop the subsequent slaughter.
The tide of history rotates at this point of refraction, in which the progress of unswerving democracy may be slowed or slowed.
Americans are on the cusp of history.
What would Trump do if he fired Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who could control Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since last year, shortly after the newspaper reported that he had secretly recorded the president’s words and assumed he was unqualified.
Rosenstein said the Times' explanation was inaccurate.
"How would we react if the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on Brett Cavano wasn't enough or it wasn't legal, or if the Supreme Court ruled us acquitted despite credible allegations of dishonest testimony and sexual assault?
And above all else, will Trump be responsible for voting in the midterms for Congress?
If we fail to meet these challenges, democracy will fall in the long winter.
But I do believe that we will not fail because of the lessons learned in Prag.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had once been an embassy and was exiled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that occupied Czechoslovakia.
My mother survived, and after 60 years of immigration to the United States, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a Nazi tycoon.
How can I not be optimistic about the future with this legacy?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrance Optimised Ahead of Rafit Bean
The Rangers compete on Thursday with home team Rapit Wien, who know that if they beat the Austrian team in this match, following the amazing draw they made against the Spanish Villarreal earlier this month, they will have a solid base to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance did not appear until he made his first appearance in a 2–2 draw against Villarreal due to a knee injury, but he believes the Rangers will be able to achieve greater achievements based on these results.
"Biyareal was a good score for us because it's a good team," said 31-year-old Doreen.
“We went into the stadium believing we could achieve something, and we were able to score points.
I don’t know if I could have scored more in the end, but overall, the draw was a fair result.
I think we did better in the first half, maybe we did better in the second half.
On Thursday, the big game of the Europa League will once again take place.
What we want is for us to score three points, but I think Villarreal is not going to be easy because it was good in the last game, but with the fans of the stadium, we will be able to achieve positive results.
Last year was definitely tough due to personal injury and changes in the club, but now the club is quite satisfied.
The team is in good condition and all the players are enjoying themselves. The training is also good.
Hopefully, I’ll go ahead and forget about last season and succeed.”
Women, you can't sleep with old money worries.
Although the survey participants had clear ideas about the care services they hoped for, only a small percentage of them had a conversation with their families.
In this national survey, half of the participants said they were talking to their spouses about organ care services.
Only 10% said they were talking to their children.
Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Program, said, "People want their families to take care of them, but they don't want to step forward and talk."
This is how the conversation starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t have enough time to tell them what you want, your family won’t have enough time to prepare for care.
Talk to your advisor or family about where and how you will be cared for, because these options are important factors in determining the cost of care.
Bring a financial adviser with you: If you have an adviser, it can help you pay for care.
Funds for long-term care services can be raised through long-term care insurance policies, or cash value mixed life insurance policies. Or, if you have enough money, you can treat your expenses as private capital.
Be sure to resolve legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Establish a health insurance agent so that trusted individuals can monitor medical care, and that professionals can follow your wishes in case they cannot communicate.
Also, consider borrowing the power of a lawyer to manage your finances.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions and avoid paying bills when normal life becomes impossible.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine your elderly parents are on their way to the hospital in an emergency.
Can you answer questions about your parents’ medications and allergies?
Be prepared to write details on your written plan.
Martin said, “It’s important to have a financial side and who the doctor is.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Fallu on Friday, officials said.
With communications out of the way, relief officials could not obtain any information about the region of the eastern gala regent, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people fled Fallu after the disaster.
Some important facts about Fallu and Dongala areas of Sulawesi include:
Fallu is the capital of central Sulawesi, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island. The population of Fallu is about 379,800 as of 2017.
Fallu was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami during the city's 40th anniversary.
Donggal is a 300 km (180 miles) regent region along the coast of the northwest part of Sulawesi.
The regency is below the administrative level of the province. The population of Donggala was about 299,200 as of 2017.
Agriculture and fishing are the main industries in the central region of Sulawesi, especially in the region of Tongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated in Morowaly, on the other side of the island of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Damage Reduction Agency, Faloo and Tongala have been hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years.
A tsunami in Dongala in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of East Galára, killing nine people.
Indonesia is geologically located in the Pacific Rim volcano and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Recent major earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: On December 26, a threatening earthquake struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean. More than half of them came from Aceh.
2005: A strong earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra in a row in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the coast of Sumatra, on the island of Nias.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Indonesia's most populous Java island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude struck the western capital of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Fidi Jaya regent region of Aceh, causing riots and riots among those who recalled the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the building.
2018: A menacing earthquake hit Indonesian tourist attraction Lombok Island, killing more than 500 people. Most of the damage occurred north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake and thousands of tourists were temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's oldest son, Track, has been arrested for assault.
A 29-year-old track Paylin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Saturday for alleged domestic violence, obstruction of reports of domestic violence, and resistance to arrests.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance called the police and tried to report the charges, Palin took her phone.
Palin is currently detained at the Matanusca-Sustina pre-psychological facility and is tied to a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He also appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself “definitely innocent” in the face of protests.
Paylin could be sentenced to a maximum of three A-class misdemeanors, a maximum of one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanors, which may require a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the assault.
The case is now in court.
In January 2016, he was charged with possession of a weapon during domestic violence, obstruction of reports of domestic violence, and domestic violence.
Palin's girlfriend claims he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin said in 2016 that her son's violent behavior was due to a post-traumatic stress disorder that stemmed from his experience with the Iraqi military.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
On Friday, an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are paralyzed and the death toll is expected to rise within a few days.
The quake slightly moved out of the heart of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
A video of a moment of shock on social media is circulating.
When the tsunami landed on the beach, hundreds of people gathered in Fallu to enjoy the beach festival.
Federal Prosecutors Unusual Attempts to Execute New York City Terrorist Suspects
New York's federal prosecutors plan to sentence Sippof to death, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City where eight people have died. This is a rare case of federal crime in New York State that has not been prosecuted since 1953.
The 30-year-old Cypor reportedly used a home-dippo rental truck to hit pedestrians and cyclists he encountered while driving on a bike road on the Lower Manhattan West Side highway.
According to a statement filed by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Cypoff “intentionally” killed eight victims and was “intentionally” fatal.
According to court documents, both charges deserve the death penalty.
A few weeks after the incident, the Federal Grand Jury issued 22 indictments, including eight murder charges, violent charges of incursions, and alleged car destruction, which federal prosecutors frequently file in premeditated criminal cases.
Prosecutors said the attack would have required "serious planning and deliberation" and described Cypoff's criminal ways as "extremely vicious, cruel, and corrupt."
"Sepoulo Javibulevich Sypov brought injuries, damage, and death to Diego Enrique Anhelini, Nicolus Cleves, Ann-Rore DeCardt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erridge, Hernán Perucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pegnuco's family and friends."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since New York’s Southern Court sentenced him to death.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal executions in New York state were in 1953 by Julius and Essel Rosenberg, who were both convicted of complicity in espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sypov, a former Uzbek citizen, did not show remorse for a long time after the incident.
Police noted that Cypoff told investigators that he felt good because of what he had done.
According to the indictment, Sypov stated to the authorities that he had obtained the idea to commit a crime by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, Sypov also asked for the flag of ISIS to be placed in his room.
He has denied 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the attorneys representing Cypoff, said the group was “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that trying to get the death penalty out of jail would only make everyone involved worse off than accepting life sentences that are not likely to be released and admitting the charges.”
Sypov’s lawyer asked previous prosecutors not to prosecute the death penalty.
Conservative congressman, age parazie, says we should be in charge of the Brexit deal.
Nazarene Farage vowed to “activate the popular army” during a protest at the Conservative Party meeting today.
Farage, a former leader of the British Independent Party, said politicians should “feel the heat” of the European Union opposition. One of Theresa May’s cabinet members said he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Vaughan told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit minister, Britain would have “already left”.
However, May is finding it difficult for the remaining European Unionists to take part in a protest against Brexit and unite a severely divided cabinet.
With Brexit, opposition, and the European Union on the move, May is fully committed to putting the European Union on track.
May's allies advised her to keep pushing for a deal with the European Union headquarters in Brussels, even if there was a backlash, and let the Labour Party and the European Union Opposition choose between her proposal and her "confusion".
At a rally in Solihull, she said that leaving meant leaving, “I want to break the agreement with the European Union.”
He suggested that Farage should have been a colleague and should have given him permission to negotiate with the headquarters of the European Union in Brussels.
He said, “If Farage were the general manager, we would have already left.”
Bourne, a member of Wellingborough, also added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must first break the agreement with the European Union."
Speaking against the European Union, he said: “We didn’t go to World War II to be obedient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
He denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote. "It is entirely wrong for the people of the Commonwealth to change their opinion to remain in the European Union," he said.
The Conservatives' departure from the European Union, Andrea Jenkins, also took part in the protests and told reporters: "I will simply say, Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Prime Minister’s agreement has lost popularity among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, and the deal is not popular with the Conservative Party and the activists who walked the streets to elect us in the first place.
Please shut down the deal and listen to the people.”
In a statement to May, she added, "The Prime Minister can only keep his job if he keeps his promises."
At the rally, Farage said that if politicians betrayed the 2016 referendum decision, they should “feel the heat.”
He added, “This is a problem that we, the people, and our political class are facing.”
"They're trying to betray Brexit. We're here to tell you that we can't betray the people and just run away."
In a statement to his enthusiastic supporters, he said: “I want you to show a hot taste to our political class just before you betray Brexit.
We will mobilize the people to bring Brexit victory to this country and we will never cease to be an independent, autonomous and proud Commonwealth.”
Meanwhile, the European Union Residencies held a protest before a two-hour rally in central Birmingham.
After the residual march began, some of the activists waved their arms to the Conservative Brexit banner.
Adonis, a senior Labour executive, held a rally and insulted the Conservatives who faced security issues in the party's app.
“These are the people who said Canada could have all the information technology systems and all the other technologies in it, and that it could have frictionless borders, free trade without Ireland, and so on,” he said.
"It's nonsense.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's "Revision" Plan for the Presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election, “I will consider running for the election.”
Boston Globe reported that Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, had shared his plan with the town council in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has frequently criticized President Trump, competes in a re-election with Republican state leader Jeff Deal, who was co-chair of the Trump Electoral College in 2016.
In 2020, Trump’s campaign will be dominated by Warren.
Holyoke's Saturday afternoon event was Warren's 36th municipal meeting using the town council method applied after Trump's election.
One of the participants asked her if she had any plans to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for "women to go to Washington and get on top and fix the broken government."
Suspect arrested for shooting Sims at Louisiana State University.
Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims said police arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting.
Baton Rouge police said they arrested 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at 11 a.m.
ET News released a video of Friday’s shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead in college on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said, "The Wade Sims were shot in the head and died as a result," according to 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wade was shot by Simpson while trying to protect his friend.
Simpson was on the scene during interrogation, carrying a weapon, and confessed to firing at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at a police station in the eastern Baton Rouge district.
The Sims is a six-foot six-inch basketball player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games last season, scoring 10 starts, scoring an average of 5.6 points per game, 2.9 rebounds, and 17.4 minutes per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton, Tim Oderro and Sebastian Pettel to win the World Championship
On Saturday, when Valtery Botas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team order would play an important role in the race.
From the start of the match, Botas made a pleasant start, holding the lead for the first two laps, calling on Pettel to attack his fellow Hamilton, and throwing him away.
Pétel entered the station first and allowed him to continue running at the end of the group. He had to be more careful at this point.
Hamilton entered the stop after one round, but after a fierce confrontation between the two vehicles, the Ferrari driver was forced to move out of the interior after a double-action at the third conversion point, at the risk of resistance, and he was able to move forward.
Max Perstafen started in the back row of the stadium on his 21st birthday and finished seventh on his first lap.
After that, he held the tire tight for most of the game and saw a quick finish, as well as hitting Kimi Raikönen in fourth place.
He eventually reached the stopping spot on the 44th wheel, but was unable to speed up for the remaining eight laps, and Raykönen returned to fourth.
“Baltery was excellent all weekend and it was a very gentlemanly day for me to pass.
Our team was very good, finishing first and second," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump publicly ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, claiming she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Caverno of sexual assault.
President Trump did not speak directly about Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee at a rally in West Virginia, instead accusing what's happening in the Senate of showing "despicable, bad, and untrue" people.
“What’s happening in the Senate over the past few days and the beautiful thing is, when you see anger, you see angry, mean, nasty, untrue people,” he said.
I saw what was published and what was leaked, and I said, "Oh, I didn't."
"I didn't."
Do you remember?"
Did Senator Diane Feinstein leak it?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
"I didn't run away."
Well, wait.
“We leaked...” No, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ms. Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against Ms. Ford in July against Ms. Caverno, which was leaked in early September, but Ms. Feinstein denied that the letter was leaked from her office.
The Hill newspaper reported that Ms. Feinstein claimed in the Senate that she "did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, did not leak her claims."
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as she asked.
But President Trump did not accept Senator Pinestein's claim. President Trump said at a rally on Saturday: "It was a really bad body language, to say the least."
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democratic Party was using these charges for its own purposes.
“They’re trying to get their power back at all costs.
You can see how despicable and lousy they are, and they don't care who they hurt and who they should fall for to seize power and take control of," said President Trump.
Elite League Dundee Stars wins the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against the Dundee Stars.
The Dundee Stars won 5-3 in their second match against the Belfast Giants in Dundee on Saturday, abdicating their defeat in an elite league match against the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The Giants were Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bobillier's first two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Connie created a tie with the Giants by adding a goal for the home team Dundee Stars before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard added one point to Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals before deciding on a victory, which Dundee tied with the Giants.
It was the third Ellat League loss of the season for manager Adam Kif, who beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
For Dundee and the Giants' fourth game of the season, the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the first three and thirty-five minutes with the help of Kendall McFaul, and four minutes later David Rutherford's assistant, Bobbie, doubled his score.
Sullivan helped the home team take control of the game early in the game at 13:10, and Connie scored the same goal at 15:16 with the help of Matt Markart.
Dwyer scored a second goal that night, and the Giants ran the lead until their first break.
The home team picked up the heat, and Buchar once again tied the home team with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Coran helped Dundee take the lead in the second half of the season, and he led the team to a win in the mid-season.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will have their next match with Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Air traffic controller kills hundreds of passengers trying to help avoid an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller died trying to help a plane carrying hundreds of people safely land on the ground. He is hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, followed by Tsunami, which killed more than 800 people and left many people missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to strike and damage the area, and many people are trapped in the rubble of the city of Fallu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the control tower at the heavily shaken Mutiara Sis al-Jufrey airport.
He was there to ensure that the Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was safely taken off.
He thought the traffic tower was collapsing, so he jumped from the control tower.
He later died in the hospital.
Australian ABC spokesman Johannes Sealight said his decision would have saved hundreds of lives.
We used a helicopter from Balipapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died before the helicopter arrived in Fallu this morning.
“This news seems to break my heart,” he added.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency, access to Donggala, the region, and Butong is restricted. The authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands.
A spokesman for the disaster relief organization Sutopo Purou Nugroho said, "The number of deaths is still increasing. Many of the bodies are still under the rubble, making it difficult to recover them."
A wave of up to six meters has devastated Palu, and a large funeral is scheduled for Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft carry aid supplies and supplies.
The child’s mother, Lisa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News that an ambulance “brings the body every minute.”
Lack of clean water.
Small groups of people are being looted from across the country.”
Indonesian International Red Cross (IRC) representative Jan Gelfand told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.”
This case is already tragic, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesia's President Joko Widdo arrived in Palu on the 23rd and gave the following instructions to the military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the case."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered more than 550 deaths in the Lombok earthquake earlier this year.
According to Air Nyugini, a man went missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline said one person was missing after the plane hit the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, and all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release on Saturday afternoon that it is currently unable to find a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find men.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details, such as the age and nationality of the passengers.
After the plane sank to land at Chuuk Island Airport, local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven passengers were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all remained stable.
The exact order of the events, what is the cause of the crash, is still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jains said the plane came in very low.
“It’s really good,” Mr. Jain said.
Mr. Jains said he and others succeeded in walking through the rising water to the exit of the sinking plane.
The panicked crew were shouting, and he said he had minor injuries to his head.
The U.S. Navy said the crew, who were working on the pier improvement before the plane sank into the water at about 30 meters (100 feet), helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat that could transport people off the coast.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airline crashes in the past 20 years, but none of them have been connected to Air Niugini.
The analyst explained that one night a woman appeared to be on fire alive.
Prosecutors suspended Saturday's review of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rolet, an expert in information analysis at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours.
Rollett used his cell phone records to explain to the jury how he had identified the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis on the night of Jessica Chambers's death.
According to reports from Clarion Leisure, Rollet received location information from several mobile phones, and the fact that Telis was with Chambers on the evening of the incident contradicted his earlier claims.
An analysis of mobile phone data revealed that during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, he was actually with Chambers, and the police went to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if he was telling the truth about what Telis said that night in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that "my truck was in Nashville" and that he was "lying".
Another contradiction is that Telis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
After Chambers' death, she said, she removed Chambers' texts, phone calls, and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defendants will begin their final discussion on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be brought to the jury later that day.
What is a noble racially conscious hip-hop?
One hip-hop trio wants to challenge their negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Hibrid, from Bristol, argues that hip hop was the first time in his history to address political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Puji and Common have recently been revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Rookie.
Another black one?
New York resident babysitter sues couple for dismissal related to "racist" text
A nanny in New York accused the couple of being racially fired after receiving a misspelled text from her mother complaining that she was "another black man".
The couple likened the lawsuit to "robust" because they were not racists.
Lindsay Plasco-Plaxman, a mother of two, was embarrassed to learn that her first job in 2016 was black.
"No more OOOOOOOO blacks," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Morris twice.
The New York Post reported that the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Plaxman, after realizing his mistake, said that an active black nanny had failed to do his job and was expecting Filipinos and fired Mr. Morris.
Morris was sent to her home on Uber for a day's pay.
Mr. Morris is currently seeking damages from the couple in connection with his dismissal. Although there is no official contract, he is still asking for compensation for his six-month stay at $350 a day for his first employment.
In an interview with The Post on Friday, she said: “I want to show them that I shouldn’t do this to them, and I know this is discrimination.
The couple refuted the claim that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Mr. Morris because they feared they would be unable to trust her after offending her.
“She sent me a text that she didn’t intend.
She is not a racist.
“We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But will you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been disrespectful to you by mistake?
A newborn?
Please."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to a "briefing", saying that his wife had only been having a baby for two months and was in "a very difficult situation."
Would you hire someone like that?
That’s not a good thing,” said investment banker Plasco.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the opinion court quickly condemned the couple through social media and rebuked them for their actions and logic.
A new letter said Paddington publishers were concerned that readers wouldn’t be able to relate to the bear they were talking about.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is difficult to realize the position of the first person to read it before it is published.
It’s interesting to us to know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
Her father, who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was inspired by a small toy bear and decided to write a children's book. She said that her father was optimistic about her work and would not have predicted it could be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which was hit after her father's death last year, was "sad and sweet".
She described Paddington as “a very important member of our family” and said her father was proud of the success of the ultimate work, but not loudly.
“He was a pretty quiet guy, and he wasn’t a brag-poor,” she said.
"But Paddington felt so real to him, it was like having a child who had accomplished something. It wasn't really what you did, but it was what you were proud of them.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he would always turn the ball over to Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but failed.
Mrs. Ednan Rapperhaus said, "Nadd called regularly and the situation was very bad. She said it would be hard for her to live."
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said she was going to die in the next two minutes. I had to say goodbye to her."
And I said so.
“Tasi, I really love you.”
I'll be right back.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors injected into her to keep her heart beating were slowly disappearing and leaving her system.
She had just died, and it was all over.
Even though I knew this was all happening, I had to just sit and wait.
Surrounded by family and people, I could not cry, scream or cry.
I had to really stand up for myself.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan Rapperhaus was saddened by the loss of her daughter, and went on a plane with other passengers, unaware of the trials she was going through.
No one knew, she said.
“I kept my head down, and my tears were falling all the time.
It was hard to explain, but I was flying at the time. I felt so much sympathy that I couldn't resist Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning attach cards to prevent them from committing suicide on their legs
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent another from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put a card on the Welsh bridge with an inspiring message and a phone number for people to ask for help.
Davis's son, Tyler, began suffering from depression when he was 13, and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the feelings I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old from Reedney, said her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew his son’s smile.
“They said his smile brightened a room.”
But he was in a really dark place, so he gave up work before he died.”
Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the first to kill himself in 2014.
"I continue to worry about the domino effect," said Davis.
Davis made a card, and he said, "To let people know that there are people you can go and meet and talk to, even friends."
Don't be silent. You need to talk."
Humphreys, who had been friends with Davis for several years, lost his 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed,” she said.
Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in a terrible state of depression. He didn't see his children when they opened their presents on Christmas Day."
She said his death was a great emotional shock to them, but they said they had to overcome it. It punctures the heart of the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we all have to keep moving forward.”

As the FBI embarks on an investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future becomes opaque.
Mr. Flake said Saturday that if he did what he asked for, such as a time-out, a range-limit investigation, it would bring some unity. He was concerned that the committee would "break apart" in a partisan stalemate.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Everything they do is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do what they expect, their attempts to elect him to the Supreme Court will be severely impaired.
George W. Bush called on the senators to support him. He worked for President Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes the report?
The Senate will now have 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate. If he gets 50 votes, Vice President Mike Pence will be able to cast a vote to confirm his appointment as Supreme Court Judge.
Kim Jong Un's 'Reduction' of North Korean Refugees Under the Regime
A South Korean lawmaker said seven years ago that the number of defectors entering South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un took power.
Park cited South Korea's Ministry of Unification data, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the increase in border controls between North Korea and China and the amount demanded by employers to help North Korea defect is a major factor.
North Korea has not made a public statement about it.
Most North Korean defectors are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defect through China, which has the longest border with North and South Korea, and is easier to cross than the DMZ.
China is often forced to repatriate defectors as illegals rather than as refugees.
Strictly speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for a meeting focused on a stalemate-free negotiations.
This comes after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. Trump and Kim agreed to work together extensively on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, Lee, the North Korean foreign minister, accused the U.S. of sanctions that there has been no progress since then.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Lee said: “Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and there is no way we can unilaterally disarm first in such a situation.”
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Caverno "neurotic" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Caverno "neurotic" and said he was "substantially unfit to serve in the Supreme Court".
Pelosi said this in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that she could not help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say, "Neural."
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
At the opening, Kavanaugh was very emotional talking about his family and his high school days, and was sometimes almost screaming and choking.
He also blatantly denounced the Democratic members of the committee around him, saying their claim was a “funny, organized character assassination” of the liberals who were outraged about Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Caverno's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with such statements and with an attitude of denouncing Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi challenged the question of whether the Democratic Party would attempt to impeach a majority in the House if Kavanaugh was confirmed.
“If he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not just not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court, he’s not qualified to serve in the courts he’s working in.”
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi, a Democrat, added that he was concerned about Caberno's decision to make an adversarial ruling against the medical law or the Law v. Wade decision that could be afforded by the former president.
Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling at the Human Resources hearing.
“Now is not the time to expect a nervous and biased person to go to court and say, ‘That’s not so cool,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to overcome it.
It’s a just criticism of rage that has been going on for months, and she can’t say it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, right?"
"I was helped by a woman who was a director somewhere who said she cried when she was angry, but she developed the following technique: When she started to get angry and cry, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
"I'm angry."
And then she kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Because tears are fundamentally misunderstood, tears are partially allowed as an outlet for anger.
At the beginning of my career, I had one of my most distinct memories in a male-dominated office. While I was in tears with indescribable anger, an older woman grabbed my neck and took me to the stairs. It was a cold manager who I was always a little afraid of.
“Never let anyone see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They're going to sue you because they think you're sad and they think they've offended you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, worked with Gary Hart to run for president.
In 1987, Mr. Hart gave up the election in an affair on a ship named Monkey Business. At that time, Schröder was deeply frustrated. She felt that there was no reason not to consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a decision I made after thinking about it,” she said, laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven more candidates in the race, and what they didn’t need the most was another.
Someone called it "the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
She was pushed out of the fundraising campaign because she started the campaign late, so she vowed not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a fight.
She realized that some of her supporters would only give her $250 to give $1,000 to male runners.
"Do they think I can get a small sum?" she wondered.
When she declared no to the official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for those who supported her, the institutions that made fundraising so difficult, the frustrations of institutions that were more difficult to target voters than delegates, and the anger of sexism.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schröder recalled how the media responded to her behavior.
“I would have thought that Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would say on my gravestone.
"She cried."
How will the US trade war help Beijing?
The beginning of the trade war between the U.S. and China seems to have exploded, and the battle is still far from over, but experts say the cracks between the two countries could benefit China in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, including imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most important quarter this week was a new tariff on $200 billion worth of items, which would tax half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
China retaliated in the same way every time, most recently imposing tariffs of 5% to 10% on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S., and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to catch a glance anytime soon.
Relenting Washington means embracing the U.S. demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say if China is able to use its options properly, the U.S. trade war pressure could reduce the interdependence of the two economies and serve China well in the long run.
“The fact that rapid political decisions in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that could trigger an economic crisis in any one country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the New American Security Center, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ‘ready to return’
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by a long war of more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem told the UN General Assembly that the situation in Syria is improving.
He said: “Today’s developments in the war on terror make the situation more stable and secure.”
The government continues to move residents to normal to restore areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees exist today: refugees have had to leave Syria because of terrorism and one-sided economic measures that threaten their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in Syria still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said he would welcome the Syrian government to help rebuild this devastated country.
But he stressed that there would be no conditional aid or assistance from the countries that supported the civil war.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the United States 16.5–10.5 in the 2018 Ryder Cup final at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States lost six consecutive Ryder Cups in Europe and has not won in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Beyoncé's team earned the crown by scoring 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, drowned his tea shots in the par 3 of the 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari a victory.
The Italian golfer Molinali became one of four to win 5–0 after the current tournament rules were applied in 1979 and shined in all rounds.
Jordan Spies of the United States finished 5&4 at the bottom of the European team, Tobyon Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2–1 to Ian Polter of England, who may have been his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who participated in eight Ryder Cup matches, scored 25.5 career points, making him the biggest European player ever.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do it today.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to win back the cup.
“It’s for the team, and I’m glad I can help,” said García, who was so emotional about winning the European team.
He hands out the torch to Spanish golfer John Ram, who beat down the legendary American golf hero Tiger Woods 2&1 at Sunday's singles game.
"I'm incredibly proud of myself for playing Tiger Woods. I grew up watching Woods play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost four of the Ryder Cup matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record.
With the exception of Jack Nicklaus, it's the second-most 14 major titles, but it's a strange statistic written by one of the greatest players in history.
The U.S. team struggled to send the ball to Fairway over the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinau, who played high-powered golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said that despite the disappointment of the team, "I'm proud of these players. They fought."
This morning we had a little bit of pressure in Europe.
We were defeated.
I salute Thomas.
He is a great team leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup and work with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I am proud to be a leader and love these 12 men.
You have to show respect.
The team played better.”
Decreased concentrations in reddish pines, manatees, and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that red tide levels are generally declining in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the committee, red tides are observed in areas of Pinera, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, meaning that concentrations are declining.
The red tide extends along the 130-mile coastline from Northern Pineas to Southern Lee County.
Red tide fragments are found about 10 miles from Hillsboro County, but in less areas than last week.
It was also observed in Pascoe County.
In the past week, moderate concentrations have been reported in Pines County, low or high concentrations in Hillsboro County, close to normal or high concentrations in Manatee County, close to normal in Sarasota County and the coast, and close to normal or moderate concentrations in Charlotte County. In Lee County and the coast, near-normal or high concentrations have been reported, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory diseases continue to be reported in Pinera, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory diseases were reported in Florida last week.
