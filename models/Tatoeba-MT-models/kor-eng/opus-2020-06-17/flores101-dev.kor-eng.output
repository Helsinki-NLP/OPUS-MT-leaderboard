Stars emit light and heat because of the energy that hydrogen atoms are made when combined to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to make nuclear reactors that can make energy in the same way.
But it's going to take a long time to see a nuclear fusion reactor that can be used as a very difficult problem to solve.
The iron needle floats in the water due to surface tension.
The surface tension is caused by water molecules on the surface of the water pulling each other more strongly than air molecules on top.
The water molecule creates an invisible membrane on the surface of the water that causes a needle-like object to come up on top of the water.
The modern ice skate blade has a two-sided hole between it and the two edges that allow it to hold the ice better even when it's tilted.
The floor of the day is slightly bent, so that when the day inclines toward one side or the other, the edge of the ice is also bent.
This allows the skater to rotate. When the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skater turns to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to the previous energy level, you must remove extra energy from the light.
"This is possible through the release of a little light particle called "the photon."
"Scientists call this process "synthesis," because the atom is stimulated by light and emits a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation."
The next picture shows an atom that emits photons, and of course, photons are actually much smaller than photographs.
The photon is smaller than the material that makes up the atom!
After hundreds of hours of using the light bulb, the cement burns and the light bulb no longer turns on.
Then you have to replace the lightbulbs. You have to pay attention when you replace the light bulbs.
Turn off the light switch or separate the cable.
This is because if the metal base of the socket or light bulb is still touched in part while it is in the socket, it can be strongly electrocuted by electricity flowing through the light bulb's socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which serves as a blood supply.
The blood comes out of the heart through a tube called an artery, and it comes back into the heart through a tube called a vein, and the smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops ’ teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate the soy plants, which were common to a hundred musical instruments.
This plant is like a small palm tree with sharp, pointed leaves in a crown shape.
Triceratops could use strong beaks to remove the leaves before eating the tree trunk.
Other scientists claim that the toxic nature of these plants makes any dinosaur less likely to eat these plants, even though other animals, such as sloths and parrots, can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you're standing on the surface of io, it's going to weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds on Earth will weigh 36 pounds in Iowa, which means, of course, gravity will pull you down less.

The first known book in the world was written in the Sanskrit language, and after the editing of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit language declined because of the class.
The Sanskrit language, a very complex and rich language, is the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
Germany was beginning to prepare to invade the British Isles in order to take over France.
Germany has named the attack "Operation Society" because most of the British' heavy weapons and supplies have been lost when they withdrew from Hungkerk.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy, and it was able to bring down any invading fleet that came through the English Channel.
But the British Navy ship, fearing that it would sink in by German air raids, didn't set a base near the invasion route.
To explain the plan in Italy first, it was the brother of Germany and Japan.
Italy built four new warships just before the beginning of the war, but both the Army and the Navy were weaker.
Italy's main target was African countries, where troops needed to start invading Africa across the Mediterranean.
In addition to this action, the Italian warships had to do nothing else.
Now, if you look at Japan, Japan was an island country like England.
The submarine is a ship designed to move under the water, and it can stay submerged for quite a while.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War Il.
In the early wars, they usually sailed over the sea, but as radar was developed and more accurate, the submarine had to sink into the sea without being seen.
German submarines were called U-Boat. The Germans were very good at sailing and running them.
Germany, because of the success of the submarines, has not been trusted to have more since the war.
King Tutankhamen, called King Tutt or The Boy King, is one of the most well-known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.

There is a variety of scandals about how many people speak Hindi, which is thought to be the world's most widely used language between the second and the fourth.
The number of people in the original languages can change depending on whether or not they include a very closely related dialect.
It's estimated to be 340 million to 500 million, and up to 800 million people can understand this language.
And because the Hindi and Urdu characters are different, but they have similar vocabulary, the people who speak the two languages can understand each other in everyday conversation.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia was strongly influenced by the culture of Germany.
Some German monks invented Estonian language to help the natives feel closer to God.

To learn how to create interactive media, you need to have a tool that's familiar not only with traditional technology but also with interactive classes (such as storyboarding, audio and video editing, and storytelling).
In interactive design, you have to re-evaluate your assumptions about media production, and you have to learn to think in a series of ways.
Interactive design has to be connected to the building blocks, but it has to be made into separate objects.
The short point of zoom lens is that the focus complexity and lens elements needed to match the various focal length are much larger than those of the monofocals.
As lens manufacturers achieve higher lens production standards, it's a secondary problem.
This allows the zoom lens to create a picture of a quality similar to the quality achieved by a fixed focal length lens.
The other disadvantage of zoom lens is that it's usually lower than the maximum cost of its recipe.
This makes low-cost zoom lenses difficult to use under low-sensitivity conditions without a flash.
Orbuscan is one of the most common problems that arise when you try to convert movies into DVD formats.
Most TVs are made in a way to entertain the public.
That's why what you see on TV cuts the edges of the top, the bottom, and the side.
It's made to fill the entire screen. It's called an object can.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, you cut the edges, and the subtitles that are close to the bottom of the screen are probably cut off.
Traditional medieval castles inspired the imagination, and reminded us of the images of the exhibitions, banquets and knights of King Arthur.
Even though you're standing in ruins thousands of years later, it's as if you can recall the sound and smell of long forgotten battles, as if you could hear horses' hoofs running wildly over gravel, and in the pit it's as if you can smell fear.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why was the castle built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
In this period of history, the castle of Kirby Mousslo is more like a fortified house than a true castle.
The big windows and thin walls of this would not have long stopped the attack on the resolution.
In 1940, when Sir Hastings began construction, the country was tranquil, and it needed only to stop the small, bustling looters.
The balance of power was a system that all European countries sought to maintain their national sovereignty.
Europeans had to prevent one of them from becoming powerful, and governments often changed their alliances in order to keep their balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war that broke the balance of power.
This meant that the European powers would no longer have the name of a religious war, so the Thirty Years' War would be the last war classified as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C., by Herodus.

The militaristic aspect of the Roman Empire helped advance medicine.
The practice was initiated by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman forces to prepare for the demand that would result from the aftermath of the fighting.
Surgeons had a knowledge of various tranquilizers, such as morphine from poppy seeds, saripool from Skopulamine.
They've become skilled not only in compression pads and arteries to block blood flow, but also in cuttings to save patients from necrosis.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has had great success in medicine and has formed much of the knowledge that we know today.
Fuerland origami is a way of folding that limits that it should be folded once, that it should not be allowed to fold more complicatedly, and that all folds should be simply positioned.

"It's not a learning disability, it's more than learning, it affects 3 to 5% of all children, and perhaps 2 million American children."
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school assignments, but they can focus on things that are fun, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without a word.
"These kids tend to be in a lot of trouble, because they want to be more stimulating, because they don't have enough of the existing stimulus, so they want to do something dangerous, fight, challenge authority."
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other kids don't understand why kids with ADHD behave that way, why they say that, or why they're mature.
As the ability to acquire and learn knowledge has changed in the way mentioned above, the standard of learning has changed.
The approach to information was different, and now it's starting to focus more on the ability to summon, not the ability of individuals to summon.
In essence, the Renaissance has brought about significant changes in the access to learning and in the distribution of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, the ancestors of mankind no longer use their hands to walk, to support weight, or to ride trees.
Chimps ’ hands, feet, reflect the use of their hands to hold their weight and are similar in size.
Human hands are shorter than feet, including the skeleton.
The fossils of two to three million years ago show that the hand's specialization process has been altered by manipulation from motion.
Some people think it can be very tiring to have a lot, a lot of artificially induced consciousness.

Tourists can visit various places in a particular country, or simply choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists also saw this activity and asked for reinforcements.
The reinforcements that were put into the front row included 200 members of the First and Third New Hampshire regiment, who were Colonel John Stark and Captain James Reed (later both become generals).
Stark's men took their position along the northernmost fence in the position of the Colonist.
As the tide turned out, the crevices along the Mistix River, which ran through the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence to a short stone wall to the north to the edge of a small beach.
Greeley and Stark have established a base about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the regular army passes by.
The U.S. mission was a joint attack from three sides.
General John Cadwalder will hit British garrisons in Bodentown to block the reinforcements.
General James Yuing led 700 militias across the river from Trenton Ferry to take over the bridge in the Asunping Peaks and block the enemy's escape.
The main attack forces of 2,400 are separated into two groups across the river nine miles north of Trent, each under Green and Sullivan's command in order to launch the Winter attack.
We're going from four hundred meters to eight hundred meters, and we're going to lose speed, and we're going to need absolutely global power.

For those who participated in regular activities, more support was needed on the high level of pain, the uncomfortable feeling of physical activity, and the negative perception of pain.
The vision, or the ability to see, is the sensory organ of the visual system, which is up to the eye.
Depending on the requirements of organisms, there are a lot of different structures of the eye.
Different structures have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelength lengths, and are different in accuracy.
The population is the set of organisms of certain species within the geographic domain.
When all the members of the group are identical in terms of certain phenotypes, they're known as monolithics.
When an individual shows a number of variations of a particular personality, it's a whole group of individuals.
Military ant colonies march at different times and build an ant nest.
At this stage of migration, the army ants march at night and stop during the day to camp.

Hopefully, most people will realize that working with other people is the best option in the long run.
Many people dream of a day when humans can travel to other stars and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there, some people believe that aliens and other creatures can live on other stars.
But even if it does happen, it won't happen for a long time, because stars are so far away that even neighbors have thousands of trillion miles apart.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will stand on top of the alien world and wonder about their ancient ancestors.
Animals are made up of lots of cells, they eat food, they digest it in their bodies, and most of them can move.
Only animals have brains.
Animals live all over the world, they dig, they swim in the ocean, they fly in the sky.
Cells are the smallest unit of structure and function of organisms.
The cell is derived from the Latin cella, which means a small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you see that they are made up of little squares or spheres.
British biologist Robert Hook looked at Cork's little square under a microscope.
