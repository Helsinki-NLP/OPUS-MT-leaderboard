For example, a man could say that because of the car, it became necessary to develop the road.

In Savannah, the need for amino acid in the body of a primate with a digestive system like that of a human was met with a smile from the trees and plants there.
This is what happened: The wrong things the sinful self does were done, the wrong things the sinful self does, and death.

To better visualize traffic flow, relationships are established between three main things: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
