Obama Receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
Obama’s deal with Iran’s nuclear program has worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech in front of the US Congress, which was seen in part as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a slightly shrill voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities' letter, which he wrote under the letter.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he reportedly shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fateful emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police seized him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some propensities for problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had a health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work in 2009 at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
At that time he was the women's squire.
All the girls melt away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the wake, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students to come back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call called Prentiss, though there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give its current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 more hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it’s gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film begins, and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gait and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “unquestionably the biggest time travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 Polls That Show Donald Trump Is Serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are starting to seriously question what it means for the real estate mogul’s chances of nominating.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s resilience and starting to let their dollars flow in order to topple him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “angry” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “worried” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to perform his job effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll from last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change from the time four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for finalist Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his election campaign peace two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse since 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will deter crucial Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
Frustration about the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their out-of-state status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post poll on Monday they’d rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a horse-drawn roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"At Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student hostel in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany’s top residential locations, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & V<0xC3><0xB6>lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, well noted.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here, by the way.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and G<0xC3><0xB6>tze
Double goaltender in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller has just one run.
A lucky hit by Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller paved the way for FC Bayern to earn a 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A superb start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witch's keel of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s double pack (52./90.+2) and G<0xC3><0xB6>tzes hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third round.
In his 28th Champions League match for Bayern, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who had a shot of the world champion, intended as a flank, pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed imagination, without shining.
Piraeus had won its last six home matches in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also crashed here.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran bravely, but in their offensive efforts they often went too recklessly to work.
The attacks were too often initiated by game-changer Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was more fortunate from the right than his flank from the right half in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion conceded the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in half one.
First, when Olympiacos striker Idea Brown hit the headball of Poland off the line (26).
Then by direct take-off, goalkeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put on needlesticks.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was, however, confident.
For example, when he directed a shot of idea over the slat (56.).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze, after muscular problems back in the squad, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already evil."
Guardiola also decided against him on the first switch when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59th).
G<0xC3><0xB6>tze came late for Arturo Vidal (76) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters M<0xC3><0xBC>ller put another one on it.
Before the game, there was a riot in the stadium.
After a small group of partly disguised Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of the host of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium injured.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Anyone who smokes not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this is what a Potsdamer long-term study suggests.
The good news is that if you give up, your risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums, the DIFE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of DIFE: "Smoking shortens life span."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIFE said.
Previous studies have already suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from the Late Antiquity on the banks of the Cologne Rhine
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always attracted as a specialist in archaeological land-mining.
In the third construction section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that a fortress and a church stood on the site in the 4th century and in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured by freight train
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern is injured, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building coming at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, she suffered the most serious injuries due to the recording of the train.
She was treated on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescuers.
There is no information available to the investigating officer on the reason for the young woman’s night crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelb<0xC3><0xA4>ckerweg, Thomashofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Leiffarther Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (L364) are asked about this.
Information about the cause of the accident can be obtained by calling the Federal Police’s 24-hour free hotline on 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To ease the dispute over the planned TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m said at the launch.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the US and third countries in equal parts.
A second instance is also foreseen for the first time.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposing their judgments.
In the discussion in recent months, it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m commented.
In the long term, she wants to work for an International Investment Court, according to her own information.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved there.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS) demanded mainly by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitral tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel jurisprudence through which companies can dispute damages at the expense of taxpayers, lift national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial comments, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German Economy Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of lawsuits of the economy by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is considered no longer sustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flipchart, on which the shy looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost gripped by Steven’s lecture.
He tells about the various places he repeatedly records on the map, about which his meticulously and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they came from and what they look like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that blend harmoniously very close to American folk of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a storied series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in sequence.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live is enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois") was released.
Overwhelming with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the annual bestsellers of the influential music media.
After highly productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic offsets on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth full-length studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and hall.
Long as the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decor.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept Hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now seated in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus "throw away the plate basically".
First, Stevens humbly thanks an addition, plays acoustically a few older songs, and finally bows to the thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Hour
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Hour has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the prime minister’s Question Hour and will take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-specified questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being scrutinized by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to lower the <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 limit to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to face David Cameron since being Tory’s boss over the past decade across the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s question time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “skills” and fighting with reluctance and instead has set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him if he does not participate – for example, if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "casperle theater" often associated with the prime minister's question hour, but a few years later he admitted he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question-and-answer session with the prime minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s ruling and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': Homeless youth trained to be photographers
Johannesburg’s city centre is a tough place to be when you’re homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound surged after data showing an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, non-bonus earnings in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% year-on-year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the time of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after receiving takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it took in $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put its rating on “selling” for the company.
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are putting expansion at risk.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it’s unlikely that this purchasing power will offset his company’s higher labor costs, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
L<0xC3><0xA4>ppische 21 years young, a henfling with upper-sharpening frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More, even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is spinning through.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 am, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where you live Idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to sit in tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her dream."
Compulsory schooling?
Who's heckling?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber.
He's taken care of anyway.
For the Superbowl commercial break, he cashed three million dollars, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company flushed many, many dollars into Bieber’s account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you’re amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have earned more than $100 million in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato field idea
Potatoes or donuts?
Both are possible - in the potato field sonar developed by Oldenburg’s snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of doughnuts", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, his shop has turned into a barbeque skewer, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: “It tastes even better together,” he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash Launches Soil Sterilization Campaign to Combat Aldi Incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi raid in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a land tenure campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as through event shows.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA store business and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will snatch about five percent of the food market in these two states and take sales away from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food and grocery sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and grocery trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt relief while putting pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to match selling prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers by improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash Chief Executive Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and shop remediation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as the "Special Ks", came to the fore through Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
“One thing I’m pretty excited about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi got a little bit into the fight,” Healy said.
He broke a club when he lost in the U.S. Open due to a convulsion, but he’s not the first player to break a club out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too harshly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he’s never had a problem with the other players, he’s respected in the dressing area, he’s trained hard, he’s in good shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be rewarded for his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man that he will return to the team as a long-term permanent component."
“First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick very quickly made the ascent, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and he only has the best time for him to do so.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, arresting all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s-land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more migrants arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for the 40,000 people who sought refuge in overt Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming refugees are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not war refugees entitled to protection – a view that strongly contradicts other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-metre (13-foot)-high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia, which also imposes higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree procedurally to the use of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the country’s security adviser for Orban, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, with 15 others already penetrating deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed-wire train car had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pressed a crowd to push themselves in.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election vote.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election campaign, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say what their opinion is about which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but those lead have declined.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage in democratic voters under 50 has skyrocketed, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the primary say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the belief that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Consent to dealing with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential presidential office into the limelight, 57 percent of Democratic voters want to see him in the race — even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the “most selectable” has risen.
Still, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters ask questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters in the by-elections.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well with some important features among voters of their party’s by-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts out the three candidates best with honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the by-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server during her tenure as foreign minister continue to be asked, most Democratic voters in the pre-election are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen by her party’s voters as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush are the most honest.
A majority sees Sanders more as being honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the by-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, growing from 23% in the latest CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson ranks well among demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been beaten by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the most, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls — he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some biases for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach lovers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, says the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood members charged with the death of a Baruch college freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a heinous ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York’s Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with blindfolded eyes, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then he fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became incapacitated and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the welfare of the fraternity basically above that of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly subjected to blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's bullying, and at least one student has died from bullying every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment and forming a criminal association.
"We not only want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked their membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the rise will fluctuate, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long all this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase comes in, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset returns to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first raise, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after interest rate hikes by the Fed.
In fact, over the past 35 years, the market has been mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase, fairly flat at the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14 percent.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tended to occur later in the rise cycle, and returns began to decline.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage it.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable here that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an interest rate increase of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate hikes since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes under such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of “whether it’s different this time around,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Fed rate hike throughout the year, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only gives a 25 percent chance.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession highs in the shadows very quickly after the onset of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the raising cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will bring yields closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, though “we’re still cautious about expecting higher returns,” Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tightening monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has risen — all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debt.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dubiousness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated the Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC's bosses that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘dumb’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” said Mr Bingham.
The BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work needs to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that caught the eye of commercial rivals during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hopes the company will "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee-payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday has slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," IMRG's Andy Mulcahy, editor of the index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers began making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s changing, and we may see growth diminishing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which each takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers flocked to their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where shoppers fought over bargains, could deter shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are being carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed into Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
Sorrowful people, largely dressed in white, filled the path to pay their respects when the first of the dead made their last journey to the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 monks who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have stopped the crane’s arm when it was not being used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said the company’s management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which took place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is undertaking major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came amid strong winds and rains, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) should be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount to the permanently injured.
The injured receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss Says Time for Cheap Eastern European Craftsmen is Over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
As a result, 200 more screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q outlets will close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British put down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or a brush to strike walls, nowadays you seem to belong to a minority.
Because Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen to do home-made jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the brick-and-mortar chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at the lowest prices is now outdated.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are predominantly men.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: “There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of items by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed company in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent of the team staffed with women, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the costs of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
At the state court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from association accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials have also been charged with financial crimes.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Sch<0xC3><0xB6>fen Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
To the rejection of the infidelity, the defense stated that at no time did the association suffer a loss of property.
The sports officials would have charged only compensation for expenses and would have taken out the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to about 600,000 shillings (worth 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: do we continue to run the club or do we lock up?" said one of the defendants, in the bread profession large-scale auditors of the tax office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We have advanced money, put our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said at the acquisition.
It was agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, no debts can be made.
In addition, with appropriate financial success, it was decided to pay back the expenses until 1991.
As a result, some of the compensation was only paid out years later, starting in 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and non-detail bookings also appeared, the former obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts were not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial settlement, it was important that only debt-free, according to the answer.
When investigations began in 2011 against the one official for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association’s account.
That was the case, the defendants said.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know an answer to this question for a long time.
Then he finally thought that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage compensation".
Why damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording because no damage had ever been caused to the association.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never received a cent salary, he only charged mileage and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documentation for the early years.
These were no longer kept after an operational review, in which everything had been judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage money.
All corrections were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence V<0xC3><0xB6>lkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to lay off 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the three-year-long downsizing, the computer giant will cut more jobs when the company splits up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which will begin in the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 fiscal year.
In the post-market period, Hewlett-Packard's stock dropped 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto, California-based printer company is currently splitting up: This is how the computer and printer business will be grouped into a new company this year – separate from the more future-oriented areas of computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A disappointing PC sales once again, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, last attracted the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers declined by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
Revenues fell in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only recently reacted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and are doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans envisage the total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq, however, would be mostly met with rejection: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
29% couldn’t decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair is on connected, self-driving cars and electromobility until September 27.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA auto association expect about 900,000 visitors as two years ago.
R<0xC3><0xB6>szke: an outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police deployed tear gas and water cannons at the Serbian border against several hundred displaced refugees.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the police a water cannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used unceasing pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat in anticipation.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees shrugged and suffered from shortness of breath.
Also, the press representatives of the Serbian police suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
The world is watching as the U.S. central bank comes together in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who were still thinking last week that the Fed would do this, now think the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust for an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is expected to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University Firefighters Leave Apologetic Letters
Following the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleagues later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "sad to do" with the first murder and wanted "he could make it undone," authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center employee that police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will bother" but will probably be upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they had been married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said Prentiss's daughter was "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky ones
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also alleged to have struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly a tribute to him.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is reshaping the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group expansion.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save with a better organization alone.
150 of the approximately 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the Group’s workforce.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is reshaping its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is to contribute around 500 million euros per year to earnings from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Executive Board team headed by Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the new configuration, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three-quarters of annual revenue of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the judicially stopped strike on this Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The topic of the talks is supposed to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the saving concept "Wings" is the background.
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the group’s low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can not play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this caused the left-back to cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
It will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it will take six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
When a player with this type of injury leaves the pitch, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know The Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss that appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company’s website SuperCamps, and continues: “Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my kids because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we’ve missed so far.”
All is well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content statement of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amid the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, however, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. One love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was The Seedor, and whose real name was The Geidor.
As if that wasn’t suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and begins like this: “In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, Au hopes to name a boy after him.”
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron will be familiar with the book's plot so little. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment through the money-hungry, tree-falling, thneed knitting once-ler in spite of the protests of the nominating lorax, scurrying in a snarling, squeaking in a blush.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but did not provide any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's squad, but it's still hard
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the squad that England selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t carry scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to drop Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, as – and I’ve said this before – players are their own best picks.
Long ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he knocks out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad.
The only charge that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a puncher that I highly rate.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He must get at least the same chances as before him, but this of course depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen hit next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he’s a devilish cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county of Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People might look at his stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a dot, but there aren’t a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England have made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with what was said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.
Some won’t agree, but coaches and team leaders don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain inflows if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron’s unfettered renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to get deeper and deeper with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fighting fiercely over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany’s carefully considered Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-suffering like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine them tearing up a leg to help the selfie Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan to make unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a plea bargain" and "the UK has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptic is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You can barely remember Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same way about them, but found that when you’re sitting with a hot gorilla in a cage, you’re better off distributing bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum vortex, for Blair had set the principle of the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who gave me a friendly pat on the back on Monday in Westminster — I told him he didn’t need any more time to waste for me — seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott of Murdoch’s strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I say it politely - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye trend and the wilder fields of Tory’s small-Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week as the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs, according to all reports, at their Monday evening hearing.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the vortex of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to not give Cameron a free pass for Europe that allows him to consider Labour’s support in the referendum campaign a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic ambiguities about EU membership — consistent with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past — is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogma.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign for withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of home in everything for their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the Tory government’s cost reduction in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “Basic Report” last month and describes it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims “build on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring together their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were reported in a
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO previously reportedly received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 attendees at the meeting said they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding it reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
PHE’s tobacco management also took part in the meeting.
The group’s research work “significantly acknowledges” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes were premature as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers.”
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded to previously.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One out of every two lifelong smokers dies from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC to give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought windows of time against the most popular shows of its rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC’s Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time on Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others don’t make or commission.
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s of course nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program is funded that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see what public-law television is supposed to be like.
I don’t think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo what former Sky head Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they're fulfilling their duties, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've never seen all those programs obscuring."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Speaking about the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, called on the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC's production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio - and she should take an example on public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that are too high for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did if they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Trade Show Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint smashing leg cuffs!
Dispersion bomb!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to expose the British government’s willingness to smuggle weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of entry keys, which are claimed to "get access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn’t find this poster “vandalism” funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trade posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun fair’s advertising – through a void in the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate ad, but "by incorporating bright colors and animation it remains more clingy."
“They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Weapon Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors disfigure fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a U.S. Army order about "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effect effects inside the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a dormitory, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I’ve angered—and the numerous, long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Admission to student residences ranges from mildly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It’s tempting to chat: People tell you where you come from, whether and where you’ve taken sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People’s rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues, and municipal meeting points, but they’re also the places where people dress up and straighten their underwear.
Related: Don’t Remember to Start a Relationship at University
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a space-to-space bumblebee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I used to interact with you.”
Try to feel when a comrade’s tone of companionship is exhausted – and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my dorm room had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
Since you’re starting college at the height of back-mania, knocking on people’s doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to chat and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my sympathy — but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate, who added a dishwashing liquid to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the word, among the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind making Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before letting her own music chatter, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student dormitory?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, ranting at her, having to separate again and then see her every day and maybe witness her bringing all the mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to reason a little with your lower body.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the line between a wolf and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is fun, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding – but never spoil someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but do not pin their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
Real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who don’t have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low earner."
“I’m showing you how you can still build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: he is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees are going to push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because a lot of people stay here.
Given the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in blocks of flats.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living room has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I did my project correctly.
The impending Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulations always make it particularly complicated.
Terrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a terraced house need at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities there is no place for it.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But do you not intensify the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message informing them that the "software update failed".
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room – but Apple has made this more unlikely by narrowing down the update, and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be turning off halfway and this could cause the update to stop.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The World Cup second before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion ahead of the night race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also in the running for the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city-state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a foggy bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has included another member in its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the 1st class Federal Merit Cross and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and L<0xC3><0xBC>bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen was supported by Gauselmann with a donation received by the chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to apply for the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
District office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and people seeking advice receive information on issues such as health insurance or services provided by health insurance companies.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Not infrequently, too, many services are not used by the cashiers, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly yet understood," explained the new house owner Jutta Weigand, who as head of the Altenhilfe business unit is also responsible for the Antonistift and the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this, Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.
"The Senior Care and Care Center," said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seen by both managing directors especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also dedicates itself to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a great contribution so that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: after the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-placed W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, October 6 was now set as the date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the 18th final of the Bayerische Fu<0xC3><0x9F>ball Totopokal against the third-placed FC W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning certainty," said FCE team manager Karlheinz H<0xC3><0xBC>mmer, who also points out the pre-sale of tickets that has now started.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 by winning the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB club cup 2016/2017.

Vienna architect Karl Mang dies at 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist’s house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the K<0xC3><0xBC>nstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese throws policeman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese is not well noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim is engaged, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to gain 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
He did not intellectually resist it.
Wiese was just getting his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard outside posting a penalty note for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due penalty at her feet, as the "Image" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," the city of Bremen said.
Only after that will it be decided whether the meadow is displayed or not.
Authorities in Panama Destroy 4,500 Marijuana Plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men strike 17-year-old Afghan
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salm<0xC3><0xBC>nster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 pm, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salm<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
Three people also stopped at the site of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the young man and slapped him in the face.
The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends squirmed and squirmed at the butcher, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man was taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car to their apartment and drove past it demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went to the front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were struck.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second batsman was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was wearing jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gongoll and Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Mayor of Samtgemeinde, Bernd Bormann, economic supporter Uta Seim-Schwartz and mayor of Asendorf, Heinfried Kabbert, are also happy about this.
Doctors are missing in many places in the country - Asendorf is lucky: there, Dr. Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still supporting his successor with half a job in the coming months.
After a conversion phase, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then investing 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and his wife Dr. Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at Verdener Hospital and wants to enter the practice next year as well.
"We always had in mind that the M<0xC3><0xBC>llers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple M<0xC3><0xBC>ller liked the idea of having their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The closeness and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years".
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed that the M<0xC3><0xBC>llers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, the two-time father of the family, also grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover were followed by stops in several doctor’s offices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed to the position of chief notary in Diepholz district and volunteered in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The M<0xC3><0xBC>llers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gongoll.
After conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more talk room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
The millers receive a grant of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 50,000 as part of a funding program from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," says Samtgemeindeb<0xC3><0xBC>rgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients are admitted to Felstehausen every quarter, while the average in northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf, there is another GP practice.
A positive side effect of the takeover by Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If she had not found a successor, she would have left.
By the way, those who visit M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s consultation session continue to look in familiar faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen with a smile.
She feels a bit of anguish after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and we are sure that many patients will still see us often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughingly, "We have a 6,000-square-foot plot."
"So far I've always pushed for gardening, now it could be different".
The couple has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do so "of course".
The care and safety of the people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
A controlled approach is needed.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to continue travelling to Austria and Germany and may also set up corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case for Interior Minister Vesna Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rk<0xC3><0xB6>s Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to close its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” said Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rk<0xC3><0xB6>s Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the late hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to seize them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving at the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in use.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in agreement.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was the people who were instructed to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, which is about 500 kilometers away.
“We heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to drive here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
In this way, the displacement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which had already been predicted by observers, could now take place on a somewhat further westward route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and EU partners have consistently given the country a good witness with regard to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the last night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to R<0xC3><0xB6>szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue their journey to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm a local eye in Horgos early on Wednesday: he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees to be premature after the Hungarian border is now closed.
At the moment, these are not high numbers of refugees.
One cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Ukrainian Stock Market Hackers Pay $30 Million
Supranonok is alleged to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information obtained, insider transactions are supposed to have been made in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars were won.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are ultimately caught," the SEC said in a statement.
The trial of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Help Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is heavy traffic.
People do their errands, sometimes fast steps, sometimes cozy strolling.
You control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at Paradeplatz.
Stop city railways.
pulsating, proud life in beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tables each with the headline "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is quite faced with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people with the action,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to the passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passersby spontaneously resort to chalk and supplement the sentence to "affirm my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the United States", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stay short, read, say sentences such as "so far I am not yet" and then move on.
Over and over again, small discussions are developing about the action itself, about life, the handling of death.
Peter H<0xC3><0xBC>binger is also on site.
“Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Diakonian Works Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
The fact that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to open people up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning attendant is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the issue through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice was looking for volunteers, they immediately contacted and were there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the St. Vincent's hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with her task and the experiences and experiences made in doing so.
“I see life from a different perspective, think it’s precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning attendants.
Training is offered every two years for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it was making a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases averaging 4.9 percent effective January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large parcels that will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-over-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “provides solid returns when considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
Plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that twelve analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests ahead of everything else.
The central bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress to keep U.S. employment and prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned off the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data shows that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials into stepping up this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds — and even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the rates at that point,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year, despite complaints from Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the central bank’s 2% annual target, the Fed’s representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were collapsing late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would throttle global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn’t occurred in the last few weeks, they would have taken the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. Bank employee.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there’s almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere suggestion by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “tighten” its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advocates an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible effects on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed’s representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate-fixing committee.
Recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets are getting upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and doesn’t mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/stock is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this shop is close to the cash desks and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you on request.
Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig gut, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cashier.
Where it's located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum applicant’s home on Dillinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The City Council of Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million-euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The planning for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder sports grounds is progressing step by step: in the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborated construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the board had also decided, among other things, on a request for a construction law "exception" or "liberation" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" concerned the permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
According to this, a "satellite roof with non-committal first and roof overhang" is to be built.
The planning is based on the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will bring together a wonderfully large south roof", explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the tendency of the roof to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike those prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary, because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the attic inclination - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually carries out rather restrictive requests for exemptions.
However, the construction of gymnasiums is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this", says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium construction at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included in the cost.
Grants are expected from the school and sports promotion.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg moves to Schongau
The Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of its employees move from Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of Krankenhaus GmbH of the district, confirmed by the county councillor Andrea Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, provide.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority are to move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, employees who cannot travel to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
The staff were informed about the plans.
The change has been triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should succeed him, Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, the name "Fischer" came into play, who declared himself ready to take over the leadership from 1 October and to change to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Innere Station.
Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses until next year when the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing rehabilitation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
Landr<0xC3><0xA4>tin Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
As the property continues, Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What could not happen to us better, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the quasi move to the Lech, which had been received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer had been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg hospital (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are called to the Bergische HC tonight (20.15 p.m.).
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
In the last season, the Bathers suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the raid on a cornfield near Pratau (district Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police informed.
After a gunshot wound, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youths and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman’s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, according to prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who confessed to the crime according to the statement and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not returned home as agreed the night before after visiting an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across the victim’s personal belongings.
Interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing finally revealed a suspicion of fact against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities in the police interrogation, the arrested person admitted to killing the 16-year-old and putting the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the jailer on Wednesday, the investigators charge him with murder.
Further investigations are to be made into the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing shortage
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
To this result comes a study on behalf of the association "Social Housing".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-come, first-served accommodation.
Many then come across the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also reveals significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is increasing year by year.
About 770,000 housing units are currently missing in the metropolitan areas, laments Matthias G<0xC3><0xBC>nther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in large cities urgently in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" due to the fluency in the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are to encourage social housing construction once again.
Thus, the property acquisition tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized dwellings could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-offs are necessary.
The funding program for refugee housing of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retrieved on Monday evening.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
After Hungary, there is practically no passage anymore, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb has announced that it will grant transit through Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the partition of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees set off for Croatia to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border to refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU-neighborhood of Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border on foot to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, however, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people who were arrested.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
In the southern border town of Szeged, 35 criminal cases were initiated.
The convicts face up to five years in prison and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition R<0xC3><0xB6>szke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees would have stayed there.
Practically, however, no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary anymore.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in R<0xC3><0xB6>szke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In R<0xC3><0xB6>szke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Barrier gratings were dismantled and one of the receiving warehouses in the border town was converted.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also tightened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the onward journey to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "Strangers" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein,” said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the nearby Passau.
We have previously tasted the unexpected guests first, with juiciness and drinks.
We said right away, we'll take her by car to Passau.
"This was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in an O<0xC3><0x96>N interview.
They were very grateful.
A man did not dare to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very happy about that,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had on Sunday evening in Wels switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that the rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped outside the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the rate of cross-border traffic is generally high.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to build structures in the R<0xC3><0xB6>szke camp to ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the twilight of National Socialism.
Those who suffer from this policy are not only Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to realize that the “blessed land” they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-hardy quarters
Konrad has everything to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first admission center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also done without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 blocks this year.
To meet the figure, 35,000 more homes will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the chiefs of state.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees as well.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," Ferry Maier said.
The former VP-mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places high expectations in the ORF action "Helping like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be possible for district operators to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the skylights.
For a limited time, “emergency standards” would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad based his experience on the fact that he was more successful at housing.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily confronted with the untruth.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
So far, the search for the neighborhood has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For now, the city of Linz does not plan to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, further sites should be checked for their suitability.
The mayor is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked down"
In a lengthy phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer (VP) on Monday agreed to further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
The continued movement of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, the relevant border controls are now in place.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer, the fact that Austria reintroduces controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The Next Runtastic is a Matter of Time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) are to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is one third each of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 per cent of the 2,700 square metres of remaining space in the building are already leased, while another 40 per cent have been requested.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project briefly in the Dove Market Arcade: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla store opposite the store, in which she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, now everything is about women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are from 75 euros to have.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are based in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the greater Linz region who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has got Breit put in the cradle by her mother.
I am most capable when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women fall in love with the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman can not answer with the utmost certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This trait also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether he is speaking out against foreigners, targeting journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the US presidential office is stirring up the election campaign.
And cut well with it.
This is also registered in the Palatinate town of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Some in the 1200-inhabited place is over -ten corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way either," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadter has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, which in addition to Trump also includes the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to mind in “Kings of Kallstadt” (2014) – with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “a bit of a big mouth,” Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname that the town of Kall has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to high German: the Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of Angeber.
Trump’s success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger shop in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group were the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return home permanently failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared at the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of an illegal immigrant.
This is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the progenitor.
He had repeatedly spoken abjectly about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just as he’s polttering, it’s not that nice,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump’s (“Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was a born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so uplifting".
Do you think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," said the 68-year-old.
She found it better if he didn’t win the election because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winery daughter Sarah B<0xC3><0xBC>hler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, also in the United States aroused interest.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not brought any major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull overthrew Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to 339,000 today.
Today achieved a slight increase from the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast has reached a very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour had 520,000 viewers and in the second half-hour it had 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The drop in second-night odds from The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a million-dollar-minute replacement that failed to surpass the McGuire Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Uncovering the secret?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The Bachelor, was shrouded in secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before turning three in two, you may have accidentally given a hint as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women lyrically discussed why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the game-destroyer who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as Wood’s best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house and noticed [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that they and Sam Wood as a couple would be a good fit.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week’s home visit made it clear to her that Wood could be “the one.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly tuned in to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. — and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a fight like the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula confided in his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his tarnished catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne slips at a point that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
“That was one thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans while holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian battlefield with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company seized Yukos, and his democratic efforts were halted.
The Free Voters are demanding the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt of a severe crisis at Bavaria's schools when there are not enough new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of Free Voters will meet in the sub-Francois municipality until Friday.
In fact, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overwhelm the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way forward, we have to go to the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to expel the Free Voters as soon as possible.
That’s why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bayern is pushing away, others are not."
“We need to become more actionable.”
But the state policy in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot experiment "Mittelstuf plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the secondary school level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it then takes nine years to graduate again.
But Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever you want.
Stronger Wall Street helps Dax jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a directionless and nervous course of trading over a long period of time.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start of the US stock markets ensure a clear direction, which ultimately promoted the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax of medium-sized values gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-laden TecDax rose 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 as the leading index of the Eurozone rose 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
The trading venues in London and Paris also recorded solid profits.
In the U.S., the Dow-Jones index recently posted an increase of around 1 percent.
Many stock exchanges expect that the markets will be in place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also due to the large expiry on the futures exchanges on this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens of the nuclear exit has meanwhile pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and left deep marks on Eon as well.
According to Spiegel, German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in reserves.
The German government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but eventually lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22% at the peak of Dax.
According to one trader, a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend worked.
According to this, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
Investments in future-proof wafer technologies and a focus on the automotive market should pay off.

4 people killed after police officers shot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would lessen their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th century.
Killed in August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers this week voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The land at the Emder Youth Center Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth center.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
They are waiting for the right offers, the city says.
It is not yet clear which investor is in question.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstra<0xC3><0x9F>e / Ecke Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time.
A number of investors remain concerned about the sale of their leisure retreat.
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, rallied, debated, and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP faction, who accused investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system construction management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among seafaring owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of Meerbuden and member of the board of directors at the interest representation of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a huge block that surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make it count," Schulz said.
What exactly happens on the area of about one hectare of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we need to have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twins offspring at gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to welcome young people to its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian keeps them close to the body.
At first, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first global donations raised to $5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show anything,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained about the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely and 28% partially resolved their diabetes.
In the medically-treated group, compared to this, diabetes resolved completely only by one percent and in some cases only by about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to completely overcome diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story plays in the Hunsr<0xC3><0xBC>ck
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in fiction: a young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsr<0xC3><0xBC>cker readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Bored and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees’ homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and this has produced unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand sanitizers by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of receipts of hand sanitizers among children under 12 years of age reported by poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a social media courage test.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t leave a sip of whisky around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is considered legally drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to leave when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had bumped her head, Ritchey said.
“That was very scary,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand sanitizers out of the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their “common” teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished them from her room.
The police considered the thwarted plan to be a “speech” and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision on the crossbar between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the roundabout industrial area and realized too late that two vehicles had stopped in front of the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused property damage of about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.

Griffiths Plays Down Talks About Disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel that way, but we have to keep going.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Being together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago that suggested he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford’s ex-boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with notice of withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, speaking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could withdraw if his contract expires with the Swans.
The 29-year-old has plagued himself with a bothersome ankle for two years and has not made it out of Wales this summer.
Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's Red Card was later revoked - Collum's third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains true to what he said, insisting, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was acquitted after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back on track," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unbelievable".
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which brought them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have never won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK’s of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people disrupt the process.
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the troublers into custody.
A breathalyzer test showed 0.89 per million for a 16-year-old.
The young man was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old man was 2.15 per mille and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January via his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it emotionlessly.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I’ve developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to take a notebook and pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants, and you’ll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it, even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public relations work of the anti-death penalty movement will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for help.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced to Get Out of Canning River After Wet Police Chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few feet away from a police officer who was trying to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to a house-break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not coming out, come and get me,’” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins provides an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Stewards Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to End Racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed they were running a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt pot test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
“I was going to say nothing about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised heads, and I want my owners to think I’m trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I’m not doing this, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had previously let the bomb go off in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job at my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should certainly stick to their noses because they’ve failed to try to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saudry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and maybe makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But I’ve now reached a point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s levels of frustration have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule “ridiculous” after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse’s legs, in violation of the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
"One of my co-workers mistakenly applied mud to my leg.
It could have been that way last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged for driver's flight and for failing to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Strikes Back Against Rivals Over Ring-Fighting Claims
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackles an "agenda setting" of two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Rooster coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the storm players to "fight" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimg and said they were only focused on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches to his team was a confident one, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"This shows up over and over again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ring matches when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought us the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens over and over again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,” said Bellamy.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have these types of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, it’s the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the pre-final at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to possess the entire amount and that the cafe might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape from Maksimovic.
He has a strong relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit to secure his release.
“After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden,” Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily, and stick to an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: F<0xC3><0xBC>hrerhaus tearing apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a collision with three trucks on Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to dodge to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident-causing party was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours to 2 hours.
A damage amounting to 122,000 euros was incurred.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while he was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of inappropriate pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered “concerning” web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he did it because it would "lead to pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "predicted being a police officer to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it would be an addiction – that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, having violated the conditions on January 25 of this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not appear in the Register of Sexual Offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Locksmiths avoid small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up outside the large control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many locksmiths, out of fear of discovery and arrest, increased the number of people at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn along the Inn River.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and reservoirs.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
At the Munich Central Station, according to Federal Police figures, significantly more refugees arrived on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Escalator of Tropical Storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart said.
The mighty deep is the protrusion of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days had moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, it is still possible to expect buoys of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Bodenseekreis until early Thursday.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again.
Every two years, the car manufacturers at the IAA show their innovations.
2015 is especially marked by movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in high demand: around 28.1% of new registrations were in this segment in August alone, according to the Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept cars and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is set to launch below VW Golf’s biggest competitor, which starts at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the Kombi, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what’s next for new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
It goes on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan retiree wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
On offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Baleno’s sales launch in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n paver placed their hands above all on the front: Here the radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernized, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touch screen, and for the first time Apple’s CarPlay has been integrated.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will join the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given justice to an ex-convict of the Tegel prison, who was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were confined to the tight spaces for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now back on the loose, was transferred to a larger cell.
His civil liability lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges upheld the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
They see the human dignity of the man violated.
The court now decides on the amount of the compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention from the period in question were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "a waste of the legal protection of the personality to be feared".
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
In April, they only offered compensation to a prisoner because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inhumane accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
For three months, the complainant was housed daily between 15 and 21 hours in the same cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks due to the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly imprisoned for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is increasing, even to beatings it is said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to information from the judicial press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a shortage of young people, 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do this".
What will happen to Germany, the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as has been built so far (250,000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially for affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price commitment each year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable housing units.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the Pestel Institute’s point of view, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany are expected to be able to work in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation, criticizes.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the receiving society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt.
In Germany, according to Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residency requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view has prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
In Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt’s view, the construction of networks is therefore the king’s path to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the de-rooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together first," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the kita, the administration distributes handbooks in different languages.
Should the need for female educators be greatly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity – for example, by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students with no knowledge of German in welcome classes are prepared for classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Students wishing to study could be given easier access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or a residence permit no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act when they start a study.
The latter generally do not receive baf<0xC3><0xB6>g, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to baf<0xC3><0xB6>g.
So far, patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Baf<0xC3><0xB6>g, and from 1 January 2016 this range has been reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk demand.
Students should receive Baf<0xC3><0xB6>g immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow it certain possibilities of control.
This also includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “immediately realized their right to stay here, in Germany,” he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more of an issue for the whole of society than it is today.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention Germany commit to, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we’re doing it,” he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery requires all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits that the Asylum Benefits Act provides.
In other words, doctors are primarily responsible for creating language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are being better informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s offices, interpreter costs would have to be covered, she says.
Many refugees would be helped, but also with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people, it is about HIV education.
But with the partly other images of the disease, German doctors were clear from their training, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapists Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and death fears, among other things.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dread, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental disorders would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the embrace of fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, an animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manegen staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people out of their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old.
"Manegencocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", so director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer-long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with finger-pointing and articulateness.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circuses are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are affectionately called, is read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go to the manege.
The first rule is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a Zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a cage for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the ride, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst: “Whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we’re always doing our best and we’re doing it with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
On Sundays, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe’s address with calls.
Last month they had exploited him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them to interfere with Mr Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned Members of Parliament that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the Morgan Tsvangirai-led party was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It splits up a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical plants and whose Palo Alto garage has been called “the birthplace of Silicon Valley.”
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it was only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then found himself back to his old momentum during the preseason.
“This type of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had previously suffered.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player attempts to return mid-season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s investigation has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a period where you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get through this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal start their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to get through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has learned the lesson of last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicides among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy moods,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halve the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication via social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, livable and successful, even though in reality isolation has dominated.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel all came from the knowledge that men can relate to it anyway, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of Telehealth explained to me: “My role as a listener for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often don’t feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying “I’m coping with it” has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you are visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned setting for the celebration of the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Di Maria meets on his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG pass Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut as a PSG player less than four minutes after the start of the season, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only seek qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class match of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later traded in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start, to win 2-0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't scored one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, who were able to hold a 2–2 draw in their own place against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was knocked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinian winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why, when he walked into Marco Verratti’s pass behind the Malm<0xC3><0xB6> defence, before finishing well in the long corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, they were disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who far past Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with a few missteps and bad finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patted on no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then gave up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the worries that Malm<0xC3><0xB6> could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal in the end.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion Through Share Sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
London-based Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to settle its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has devastating effects on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore’s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion stock sale last week as part of its broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares valued at up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber-espionage and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill the dream and once you rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the county of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a sling on a wet road and drove to the control panel.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern obviously faced a few years ago the commitment of Spain’s Superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times Cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we won nothing," he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008 J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
“Pep told me I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
“That’s what he got me with.”
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the pitch, switched off the reds (4:0, 1:1), and at the end celebrated the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying it was not needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
“When we talk about diversity, you’re doing it when you’re casting the film, not when you’re casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded in shock, with offended disbelief, and called out "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about – whoever the director will be – how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a hooker who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing could "in the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip, writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WELL it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took effect nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to order discriminatory practices against Colored Stop.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contestant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task was climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the exhausting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-won victory, still in shock over winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never made more than $10,000 or had a life,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
All of a sudden... like I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If there’s more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any qualms about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Formerly one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now ranked last in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within one half of the Houston Astros for second place in the American League Wildcard.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how it comes,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to go fully focused into the game.
Designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good in the (beating training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the backstroke at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks achieved a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Wall, the only man he faced, ahead of designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who escaped a two-run by right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finishing run at second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall scored an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon and scored a 5–4.
However, the right-hander stood out Sano in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a not-yet-movable Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing for more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would be able to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, creating a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“It was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, there were three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to a shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder dislocation, is expected to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a dislocation in his right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be resettled in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived in it are then to be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees may be accommodated there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the government presidium responsible for the initial takeover of Gie<0xC3><0x9F>en.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective disregard".
Four years ago, we were glad that the chalice of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is coming crashing down on our doorstep," he told Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive build-up of international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian television ORF on Tuesday evening that no one will be sent back to Hungary even now.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s agreed,” she said.
Asked about an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their goal is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany began temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far been unable to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
On Tuesday (22 September), EU interior ministers will hold a special meeting to launch a new initiative for the mandatory distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee situation in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The alliance will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection get it too.
However, those who do not have a residence permit cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are stranded on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes over Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini probe finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the escarpment of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean is collapsing.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
According to this, the moon dives slightly on its orbit around the ring planet.
This tidal motion is small, but still too large for a permanently fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of Enceladus.
Already in 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn’s moon, spewing water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding the Saturn’s so-called e-ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to forgo offensive driver Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis "probably means four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sports director Necat Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n told the "Image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unconnected professional.
As a training guest, however, the Sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Torj<0xC3><0xA4>ger Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his concussion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the match at Fortuna D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf (0:3) in a violent head-on collision.
Contrary to his first fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to its slender line, they are often advised against it.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mango chutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 aid workers for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are especially sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 allowances.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First F<0xC3><0xB6>hnsturm, then marked cold front
The next night, the F<0xC3><0xB6>hn breaks through in the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night until Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm strength through the hair dryer valleys.
After drying on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rains, gusts of wind and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the F<0xC3><0xB6>hns break through the valleys at night until Wednesday.
As a result, the F<0xC3><0xB6>hn blows until Thursday morning in the F<0xC3><0xB6>hn Valleys with buoys from 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can make its way to the neighbouring country, and even hurricane buoys of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the Alpine south slope begins to stagnate.
It is raining here, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, the southern Alps will have to be calculated over the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter, after already large amounts of rain have fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer is ventilated, resulting in a cold front with heavy, partly drizzle-filled rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days are presented in the north in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes more sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on the Oppio hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The denomination had been requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes could often only live their faith in the occult over centuries as a minority.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at that time as a lost sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but which is by no means synonymous with "fun" images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on topics such as the Way of the Cross, Plagues, Commandments or Our Fathers.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical sites on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today's context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice as much insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter order.
"That's when the education happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out in order to perhaps also put up with the Lord Father again."
His second concern was to help the art to become more important again in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his images".
Old did not pay attention to fully grasping the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans M<0xC3><0xB6>hler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for M<0xC3><0xB6>hler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction begins for BMX track nears
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, earth hills modelled for a circuit: a year later almost everything was ready - but even before the official opening of the BMX track, this was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hill postponed, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First City Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to inform now in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
It should then be started with the work on the former indoor pool without a "further commemorative break".
DFB intensifies commitment for refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga will be a clear sign over the weekend.
Football reacts to the deteriorating situation in Germany and assures politicians of its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge for our country since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say, that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz, and the Chancellor there."
“This will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive steps must be taken by politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"With regard to the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
A number of federal agencies are also supporting the program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will put a clear sign if they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi V<0xC3><0xB6>ller told the Bild newspaper on Tuesday, describing the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one is allowed to look away."
“We football leaguers can, no, we have to use our brilliance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women’s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for this Friday’s European Qualifier against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their places is great.
It is equally great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, the Association will provide 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the full amount for 2015," Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs of his brother’s house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a water glass that he had carried in his left hand, the “Economic Week” reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bled, was powerless, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott was able to do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung" (S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it was important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Any such thing can happen."
“It’s important to get back up when you’ve fallen.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen tweeted a photo of him and said he had suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore not as much in the weekend night race in Singapore as a reserve driver for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Fields of pasture in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken down.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the football league in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't rely on him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen again on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman B<0xC3><0xBC>rki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether pasture fields will be used in all Europa League games in the future.
Most likely, he will also be contesting the second game.
Reus’s research that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal is comprehensible to midfielder Julian Weigl: “Marco is not so wrong with this.”
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be technological pioneers in the transformation of the car.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA about a "new mobility era".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver "does not face any additional liability risks", the German government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The German government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver is becoming more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are “to be expected far beyond 2020”.
The authors estimate that the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German location for 2025 will be around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician S<0xC3><0xB6>ren Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver’s personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by the testing organization Dekra, which was presented at the AA on Wednesday, found that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, in the United States, 33 percent.
After all, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control on all roads throughout the ride.
On the motorway, at least 15 percent could imagine this in flowing traffic, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Almost one in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Table Tennis-EM
The D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorfer wants to beat only in singles at the title matches from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision should be made by September 22 at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said Federal coach J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Ro<0xC3><0x9F>kopf during the European Championship in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
Boll was on a long-term sponsorship flight in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
“Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said Dimitrij Ovtcharov, European singles champion.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, but also remembered the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
“At the time, Timo was also missing, and we became European champions.”
"That's what we should be guided by," said the world's fifth-ranking official.
English footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has sustained a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle from Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that Bastian Schweinsteiger’s 20-year-old co-player had a shin fracture.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure gruel cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: shop window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the terrible child of haute couture because I have white hair."
“It used to be bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view from September 18 at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris Station, Canada.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said Kunsthalle director Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly-to-be-overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort has been made: For example, a stylist has been hired to style the dolls.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were shipped to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He’s always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy is also on display.
It stands for the designer’s first soft, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he wore his Teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he couldn’t afford the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plautin lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines were in and around talking about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers, who further processed them, for example, into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen lace, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewelry, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which leans on past style epochs, forms an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery Association.
Only they are allowed to carry the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have broken away.
There are almost no private shops and also wholesale.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way yet.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outpost of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas from designers and companies that need to think primarily economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krau<0xC3><0x9F>e was inspired by this: "Before, I could not start anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and its surroundings and who want a souvenir.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spit.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a new film, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It’s about Nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already fixed: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi Urges to Open the Economy Wider to the World
The economy must open wider to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, to a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Fostering new start-ups and pushing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relax border control policies, promote state-owned enterprises (SOE), raise private capital, and overhaul the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment, and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them,” the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to be guaranteed to perform their duties and to employ professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thereby give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that based on the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch called this a “trick” because smaller peace fish, such as carp, are usually so low-stressed that they already meet the planned highs today.
The decline in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary maneuver that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is highly enriched in predatory fish, especially in the food chain.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn children".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment primarily through the burning of coal.
The German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written report by the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Greens-Bundestag MP Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
