Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about ‘going for puppets’
Welsh MPs are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour official said his group was concerned that the acronym “rims with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crust.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (a puppet), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that "the final decision on the nomination of the members of the Assembly is up to the Assembly."
The Government of Wales Act, 2007 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission favours Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighboring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, St. Martin’s bells reduced to silence
“The older people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become rarefied.
“We don’t see each other the same way anymore,” he said.
“We used to go to the bar like we did at our neighbor’s, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out long before those responsible imagine and this worries him: "sooner or later, they will return to the starting box".
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be Whites who will rush to shut down all the churches because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching in the vicinity, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks were struggling to get a job or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
Father Johnson’s son and successor in charge of St. Martin’s Church, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
She also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin didn't replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the housing upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the church’s secular elite on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese would impose on it the costs incurred, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old boy injured by a shark during a lobster fishing party
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought that the young boy was screaming for joy at having a seizure, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
Upon getting close to the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
“I was screaming for everyone to come out of the water: There’s a shark!” Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a news conference, rescue chief Larry Giles said a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim was suffering from traumatic injuries on the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami’s in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the British Aesthetic Market
Sainsbury's does low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with similar radii to those of supermarket, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, wider ranges of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets today invest in the beauty market with the aim of reusing the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in areas similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second one scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads in order to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to shop online and head to nearby stores for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more and more like large surfaces as the supermarket chain tries to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the two chains were purchased 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to propel current consumer goods sales and make acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the British chain of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products had failed, and it was not possible to do so.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it came to an end after a dispute over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
After selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago, it was to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, announced that the appearance of the beauty product ray has been changed to improve the customer experience.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any type of need and, thanks to the beautification of our radii and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes buying habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones has announced the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract linked to her home decor brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and accessories Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, furious by pulling out of their successful last-minute textile and interior decorating business, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved child on TV revealed, in a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the trading empire of the Dragon's Den star in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of their affairs.
The Truly brand has been equated with that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host’s estimated fortune to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
and in order to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters are filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could put an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we love each other
Trump has mocked the media for criticizing him because of his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and for showing himself so positive towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking a voice from a TV reporter.
“I didn’t give up anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had been in favor of holding a second meeting, after Trump called the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
The Committee regrets that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” he said.
We have fought the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracks, there’s barely more than 200 standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of dead in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been declared, a condition required for the triggering of international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they have clearly stated that they do not want international aid, which complicates things a little bit,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, she still doesn’t know if field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shocks, the country is cruelly lacking the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren sounded in Palu, which undoubtedly contributed to the human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not an easy thing.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed derelict infrastructure reform at the heart of his election campaign and spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Mr. Joko's government, which is expected to represent itself in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge manages to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a loss to Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and finished its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball but players like Shaq are always pulling as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at halftime after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward made a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before turning towards the midfield and sprinter side Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick back and forth in the middle of the field,
then made a magnificent deep shot that led Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his run in the net of the second post, with a shot from the left foot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: The number of victims of the tsunami rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the balance of the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that rocked the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
An investigation into the murder was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman with a knife was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents in the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statements: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I appeal to taxi drivers in particular, who could have picked up something on their dashcam and asked them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have indicated that they are informing the relatives close to the victim.
A taxi driver has been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were watching the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crime Failure at 0800 555 111, registry 247 of September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell’s statue erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
Cromwell’s superb depiction, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.”
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognisable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: A Pig Kills a Breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery sliced and covered with blood near a market hog in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door of the neighboring swineherd was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg maimed the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the origin of Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the breeder nor to his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked up to avoid any other incident and allow police officers to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs against people have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig caught a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to drive him away.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing harm.
All you have to do is show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rains in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, towards the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a storm, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north-east, in the south-west.
There will be up to 25 cm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rains could turn the canyons into wild rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and swirls of dust in places.
The approaching depression will result in heavy local rains in some parts of the country’s south, on the California coast.
Pluviometric totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are forecast for the month of October across the United States due to the Arctic cooling, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central U.S. region, which will experience significant temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees over the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial draws more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels on Thursday, the arresting hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political stalemate continues, broadcasters have cut short their usual Friday program to announce a theater coup: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had committed touching on her person and had attempted to remove her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed to be also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
In comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts have largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million) followed, still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not wane once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of Friday’s drama.
After the Moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken apart by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to go to the courthouse hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the footage of the interrogation live.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold the power when so many women are poor.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and would say more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and broadcast networks covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure for advancing Kavanaugh's nomination by the entire Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats were demanding.
Flake was partly convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Britain: May accuses opponents of Brexit of making “small politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of making “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a cover photo of Theresa May, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “purely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the origin of the death of the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was knocked down and is charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the crime scene, the glasses were carrying Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the medical examiner of the parish of Baton-Rouge published on Friday a preliminary report, which determines that the death was caused by an injury caused by a bullet that went through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and in shock” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We’re always afraid of this kind of event,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcano spits from the ashes
From the ash escaping from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Center recommended Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a peak in activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between separatist protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not disemplify tourists.
Scammers also broke out later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “neither forget nor forgive” faced unionist supporters shouting “long life in Spain.”
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
A year after the October 1 referendum, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favor of secession, tensions remain high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with secessionists largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
This took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are at a standstill,” he laments.
Despite their major, albeit slim, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be tried for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, said politicians were responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
“The tension is only going up,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for European Parliament elections next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly darkening a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car also received gunshots.
Livingston wins the game 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently upgraded, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second win in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of Ibrox's club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place 2nd in the standings, on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside of the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads by 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, it extends its undefeated career in the division by 6 games, and its head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he has not yet lost a single match.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of embittered opponents
Holt's team could have advanced well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained sluggish in the face of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that it could hinder them through hard-worked tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free-kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves facing an impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Ranger guard Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's strike from the foot, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston keeper repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and the composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the top, but the merit largely comes back to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team
There are a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath for the duration of the match.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they have not lived up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and only managed to break through the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the board.
President Erdogan's mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from rallying in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to spot their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescues arrived on the spot, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and warn his loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been put in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 inmates and contained in a wing of the prison.
On the spot, officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, are being held in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's probably what's going to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the southwest desert with what's left of its energy. This region could be hit by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain forecasting as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm at locations in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not exposed to the risk of flash floods.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme-grade drought, the second-most severe category.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coasts of the Lower California Peninsula.
Still of great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a flood risk.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on the charge of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4am local time.
He's been sent to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Avon and Sommerset police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the Radstock side.
Officers issued a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been a victim of democrats’ malice and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the democrats’ malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, dismissing with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” to this day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished jurists, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told a crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party official's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami cause hundreds of victims, the balance continues to grow
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when waves six meters high flooded the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t happen alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have been able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic location, which borders a long narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, noting that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater over the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” La Croix Rouge said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to release information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in a building frantically screaming at passers-by in the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications to Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military has begun to deliver cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people are still in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami is rising, with more than 800 people dead.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found refuge in tarp shelters in the courtyard of their offices, and discovered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he says.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to those affected, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And this is not yet the case.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares it is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a small boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman buried under the rubble for two days near her mother’s body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an old man in the paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu participating in the beach festival.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, Thieves Subtract $26,750 When Reloading an ATM
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharging an automatic dispenser in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a distributor in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leave the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Kanye West is now known as Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his visit for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional nickname, this nickname also has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the union line and the capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday on Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student benefits and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its dedicated research funding in the sector, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
At the same time, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubting funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined Microsoft Research's leadership team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in U.S. government-run technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that appropriates academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited top academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically given to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academy partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation that seeks to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right in its territory and has opposed its veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was as follows: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, rescued from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice to membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after tabling his newsletter.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of the participants intending to vote said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks a path through Brighton’s defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the easiest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game.
in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton pitch.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Skyblues forward sent the ball into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble-fest against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the case of a knockout game for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even though this game has no stakes, we want to take the field in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level that I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training Thursday and will start on his usual rest day, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is at 18-7 with an average points earned of 2.53 and 300 draws on shots in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that generated his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take back power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, mean and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him a public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the big community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local Momentum party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs deemed unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian were.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and colleagues with whom I thought I would share the same political vision began to expect me to turn my coat around and take positions contrary to my convictions, whether concerning national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a party member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I received were of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a plethora of sexist or racist comments every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is restricted through motions of no confidence and changes in the selection rules.
I’ve been given a lot of advice in the last two years: turn a blind eye, don’t express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late attempts may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day-to-day match of the Scottish Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized by the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
"So far we have been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute play, which was transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish winger Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers to speak.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half time. He scored and transformed a solo try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
After a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher, Ayr took the lead with an attempt by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed try by Bruce Colvine, who created palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo while he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's jaw, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the pick-up, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth try at home.
The star of Still Game launches in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that arrives will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flourishing restoration environment" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
The public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto: “The sea returns to us straight.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to the benefit of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean, once again.
Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be obliged to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the sea in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favour of Chile, and that little will change, even if a positive decision is made.
The Netherlands-based UN body did not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice rendered its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated”, explains Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years have perhaps even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales – who remains to this day one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it’s “chimeric” to think that maintaining sanctions and opposing a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any meaningful prior disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows reveal the latest trends in headwear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of crazy oversize hats at a PE19 show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
All the more extravagant hats than each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to integrate their delirious pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which swallowed the dummy's head.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-lined watermelons, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had their lips sewn and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation looked like a diving gear, with tuba and glasses, while another resembled a molten ice cone.
And if you follow the fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come all the way to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the trail of the Bomba, the wide-brimmed straw hat that the stars are tearing apart, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social media presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus fashion show during Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and establish a trusting bond with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent test scores this year, we see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of students who studied German, the 69% of students who studied French and the 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that, among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are linked to language skills shortages.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this sustainable skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically put the multilingual person in front of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not speak enough foreign language to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be accessible in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
It is clear that, at the present time, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Saturday.
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday, at the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We still don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, particularly in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote in the Supreme Court postponed, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections and preventing Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow him online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings, which took place this week. Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings primarily aims to help Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
“Congressional control is such an essential part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a Trump team spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s meeting, scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come in to try to revive him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team ready to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing swing movement is a sports concept invented from all angles but which players sincerely believe in, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
Where would they put the momentum now?
“They were leading with six points and now four, so that gives us a bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little windy and have every reason to be encouraged, including by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of having each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has proven tremendously effective from tee to green and gives the example.
As his game progressed, a crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth game as Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in contention.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the Ryder Cup story attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four matches and is not entitled to error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the crowd deliriously designate them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time with different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning’s hero of the pack, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, no one is there to help you.
Furballs and fursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can flip in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and made a considerable head start during the last day, but this foursome session also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's furballs and fursoms.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn’s European team made the difference by taking a 3-1 lead in the morning bouts against a messy American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the forks and won two victories, but they failed to bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, nicknamed “Molliwood” after a failing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the furballs, they flat-out beat the pair consisting of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself during Saturday's two games, has shone a few times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in furballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fouls, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2–1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world rankings, respectively.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, these having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although the team of Furyk, who held the crown, has only to play zero to keep his trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament will under no circumstances be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would strengthen his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Organization’s annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and its commitment not to proliferate weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticism of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved to be important in that it did not reject the idea of denuclearization as a denuclearization by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and escalates the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposing “the declaration of an end to the war.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us collapse do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings that have taken place between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Still, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after the “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year before the United Nations to “totally destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for Kim’s courage in implementing disarmament measures, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to suffocate funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made but, in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is calling for the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight the growing male tendency to study by consuming caffeine all night.
A professor noticed that most students at the best university in the world don’t know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and said, “Why am I only told this in the last year?”
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Delivered for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university’s director general of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The class time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know this won’t instantly change student behavior.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride of “spending a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure exerted on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said — even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar degree program before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to provide an alarm for both bedtime and wakefulness, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team in Livingston to a 1-0 loss.
Ibrox’s team had hoped to record their first win on the move since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team inflicted on Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team to drift, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbro.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rose to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, referee Calum Spence having had to be treated for a head injury following the throwing of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, for his part, picked the same Livi 11 who snatched a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team suffocating his opponents every lap.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored within two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized after the free-kick when Steven Lawless and him collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but Ibrox's former keeper, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and an Ovie Ejaria strike.
If Livi’s 34th-minute opening score went against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs’s stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the middle by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to make block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor managed to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COUNTER TOUR... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention which subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man asked, “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, one can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “So tell me, it sure jumps out there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to ‘detect’ cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “detect” cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves harvesting immune cells to “learn” them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Covered in a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe after his transition to the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West made a splash on the set after a wild performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West took to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe recording was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I’m in a chasm,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the chasm?" and claimed that he would wear his Superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments have drawn at least twice as much attention from the audience and SNL members seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, and a person on the scene told the magazine: “A silence of death has fallen on the entire set.”
West had been called in to replace last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West disheartened a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO BE WRONG.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Fire Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Charge of attempted murder after a white-armed assault in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The heads of prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the male hero, saying that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be tough cooks to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star, admitted that he “strongly” wanted to tackle the issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have mistreated masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, compared to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the streets teach young boys who make them think they have to behave like this to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong with it.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have ended with “battlegrounds and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character's lover, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been practically reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed senatorial data, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were supported by experts and “extreme-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the accuser's reasons.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said its office had alerted “the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, undercover spy
It has now become a tradition to seek out the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the comeback.
Will the ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export chance of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his cheeky eyes and rubber face, saw his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, possesses a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type who executes a small note in The Fire Trucks at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was also inspired by the international traveler and mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is emphasized, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves with confidence with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented and, to me, Johnny English’s farfetched misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson’s silent film gags in Bean’s character.
The ever-present premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of operatives in service - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous figure on the brink of crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to put under her nose in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy who has been compromised will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that it is necessary to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English offers an academy of espionage in the manner of Rock Academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who cause great trouble to Her Majesty's secret services, go back to the action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farfetched jokes: under the guise of servers, they set fire to a blazing French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English unleashes a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to get her home.
All stops are insured for this last sequence, but in spite of everything, there are not many things for children in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as for the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies it has worked out a plan so that the British can work for four days but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week – but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to earn the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to enjoy economic change.
A major source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “It is planned that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" in public utility companies.
The Deputy Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover their full stake since the Labour government could operate "deductions" due to alleged conduct differences.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will contribute 10% of private company capital to employees, who will borrow up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy have said they will give 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh changes their minds.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Obviously,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, and unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham added, alluding to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars and invested with an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only benefit from the provision of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort in order to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clickivism” – a situation in which people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped spur global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies amounting to more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which a portion of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or lifted.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who have committed to “helping children develop their full potential,” while promising Rwanda a <0xC2><0xA3>35 million aid to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition program at a concert in London in April 2018, told the crowd.
The group also said that as a result of the company’s more than 5,000 actions to ask the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children as part of nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The road to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the great civil rights movements and the struggle against apartheid before us, we will get there because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” appeal to the U.S. Navy, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – notably where it operates at the legitimate government’s request – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is committed to boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes the city of Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s staunch opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and constitutes an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she would seriously consider running in the presidential election following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be considering running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, saying he was “driving this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a tweet, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters are not of the opinion that she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe's Center for Political Research, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent names for a potential 2020 campaign include those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is experiencing right now, what he’s feeling when he comes home, I can relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “a taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and marital violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a memo in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeals Council, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae said in a statement.
The lawyers also argued in the memo that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems — even the most serious — that people encounter every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, in an evacuation center from the empty city.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen walking into their destroyed homes, picking up strewn property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replicas.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he had felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don’t know what happened to my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “intimidation” by means of “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. parliamentary election, an accusation China denies.
Accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralysed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at striking exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press office, you will find few dissenting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, as the media firmly obeys the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China avoided publishing” his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts Warn Republicans to Alienate Electricity As Midterm Elections Approach Due to Kavanaugh’s Debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee in the context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published Sept. 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said "we can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to calm voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the Senate aisle as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be overestimated,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban electricians and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be sharp if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “It has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it's about Kavanaugh's appointment, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, to the television newspaper.
Following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans seem divided about the credibility of the two parties, with a small majority leaning towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of people surveyed believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as people authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt aimed to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team and he are not yet in discussion with “Facebook and Google” about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely messed up in an instant.
“We don’t ask their permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only churchman from the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite sniper four days later and was unaware that he had earned the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploit.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and smothering three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “one thing I’ll never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Vann said he was “very honoured to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent all night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main page, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were sidelined when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to stay awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Regarding the broadcast, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, Dave Schwartz, said that “the government regulation states that at 6 a.m., this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they would be working on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program flipped, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren’t all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you it won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more to the fans and we’ve wasted everything.
It is a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but this instilled in him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
In the context of the first Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took a months off due to her illness.
Appearing as a wrecker on Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something.”
The double Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and has taken advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” back to others.
The triple world champion claimed that he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley last year married the Oscar winner, his 20-year-old eldest, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so much at such a young age” – he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he says confidently that it was difficult to find a person of the same age having experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that “his whole perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I was only thinking of winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be sitting in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be there to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he had to die so that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That's all I've dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied her in preparations for the Olympics and always gave her the flesh of a chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
An out-of-form Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to straighten himself out to avoid it being an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's furballs and fursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and fine-tuning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest of leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the misplaced shots.
And as if the course wasn’t scary enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 games in singles, take a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to those teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun measuring themselves against him this week, which was fun to see.
It’s more than just playing.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful journey.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning it 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop reminding yourself that we were leading largely to Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but justly,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the Golf National 10 men.
History will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have one goal, to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re put to the test at your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to pass on to the players, is to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these reversals of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Miracle of Medinah”, where Europe snatched the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the whole course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship delayed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand-new frigates of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as certain stealth technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and reduced acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for a period of up to two years outside the docking ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that forward-looking warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in the event of deployment on combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the computer system failures, the price of the project as a whole – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is actually “short of ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were downgraded but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research conducted in a field in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland researchers' study will follow common pipers and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of bat calls and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development work that affects the perch and leads to the loss of their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight routes.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, inspections at the perch and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threeave site in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of the domain, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threeve, we have a perfect place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we’re doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, one can thus cause the death of 400 females and small ones, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perch.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo refutes rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him “fake information” and claimed that people “want to be known” by his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram a few hours after the allegations were spread, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “fake information.”
“No, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they have described as “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms casino hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player’s room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a "good guy" at "99%" but did not know what was going on with the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that these were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and that photographs of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt “terrified by reprisals” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the settlement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK “would regret it forever” if it were to lose its status as a world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated in "tensioned flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would stop, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the plant and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
White House Announces Trump and Rosenstein Meeting May Be Delayed
According to the White House’s announcement on Sunday, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “rejected by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel charged with investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and possible obstructions to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will send back the deputy attorney general, and therefore endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to dismiss Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we push back another week given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the talks was not due to a dislike for “demagogic” TV reporters, although she said, “I don’t mind the fact that they’re scaring the gallery.”
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president is participating in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on their own.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual appearance and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health has written to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK pulled out of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After sustaining a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ, Tennessee State's Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second-in-command, was operated on urgently after a head injury Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters the injury had occurred just before mid-time.
“He came on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him through another examination.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris said there was "no specifics yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in his second year, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total of the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of new London construction is purchased by non-residents in the UK, which drives up prices and prevents first-time homebuyers from making their way into the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by seizing land without using it, he urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to address the “real estate disgrace” in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive set of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the removal of “no-fault” evictions.
He also wants to give councils broader powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the UK, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a house as it is for British residents who work hard.
For far too many people, the dream of access to property has become far away and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently in third place in League 1, with three points from the leader.
He rallied the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father and it’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would only come, however, if I succeeded in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coach are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to stand behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a stint as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-division relegation and transformed St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better than playing.
This seems strange because I did well, I made a good living, and I took advantage of some appreciable peaks.
But sometimes playing is difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is going very well for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat has raised the incomes of struggling British pubs, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in their sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: “England’s permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup made July follow the pattern of June, where bars had risen by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The decrease of 1.8% in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of similarity than restaurants that decline.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
Unsurprisingly, catering groups continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8% drop in annual average sales is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food business operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will grant a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the establishment.
The industry’s sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children have secret accounts they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – open a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” — a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who happened to fall on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students admitting to having private accounts.
CSM leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his vast experience gained internationally over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from its participation in the council,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and lead this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a challenging job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Online, an advertisement on the breast pump that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to cows when they are trafficked.
To mark the launch of what’s called the world’s first silent breast pump, Elvie, a mainstream tech company, has launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a hay-filled cow barn, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I betray myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s my breasts, not nipples.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women who milk it.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“A bad decision is to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It’s an understandable trauma for the mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their baby?”
Someone else added: “An ad so disconnected.”
Others defended the ad, for example, a woman admitting that she found the song "ridiculous".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumper made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad for moms who suck their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast-pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to emphasize the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breast pump will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie has made a newspaper.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because the Trump administration's harsh speeches and policies have made it difficult for children to be placed at the border.
Traditionally, most respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by resorting to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that this data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are respondents or family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelters' stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with the children's case, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within the month after their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm previously.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be promptly expelled.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many struggle to manage.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw on the spot.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said about the refugees, that the conditions were favorable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred the refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war is concluded.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for “specific deadlines” and expressed hope that the military measures would target jihadists, in particular Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who “will be eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and issued a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers doubtless hope, the impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be "The most spectacular finale of a presidency!"
At this time, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at major events, is the first cable television channel.
“It’s a case that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor,” who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic author and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Some Irrefutable Truths About Slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike everything that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most affluent viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used a “deep savoir-faire” for his book “Fear,” on the 15,000-dollar Stormy leather jacket by Paul Manafort (“The Postman’s Outfit”).
I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like watching a reality TV show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and day-to-day turnarounds.
We can't afford to miss an episode or we'll be late.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was making 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sneaking in to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand aside, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were driving all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th District is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to contest the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban Pittsburgh district is the headquarters of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another riding in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands for another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which heavily overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a feud over the funding of election campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for Democratic Campaigning (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaigning Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a fair victory last March in a very popular special election in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. planned to penalize El Salvador for its support for China, then retreated
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not object to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to convene the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now due to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying history
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the issue of a collusion of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself under an obligation to account before this body, as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many “ifs,” and I’m not claiming that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable — nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had kept him in mind and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we respond to if the FBI’s recent inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial – or if it is confided to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not succeed in these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfield Graham Dorrans of his first participation of the season until the game zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve feats.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and we went away with a point.
We might have been able to win it in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match as they did a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave the last season behind us and win.”
Women are no longer able to sleep because of their fear of retirement savings.
Although the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be taken care of, few people raised the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with redeemable value to help you cover those expenses or other insurance on your assets – provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in transit.
Provide a health care power of attorney that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man was injured several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots fired with a compressed air rifle while walking home from an evening.
The victim, who was about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as a “random act.”
The victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
As communications were paralyzed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic fire circle of the Pacific and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 shook the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked to do so, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B minor offence, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication related to the incident.
His partner had claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time of the tsunami unleashed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a person suspected of a terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assailant who made eight victims – a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing into pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and inflicted “intentionally” serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for violent crimes and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “a careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecutions for the past ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiring and spying for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” by the decision to sue.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had already asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a rally at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backbencher MP Peter Bone said during the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been liberated” if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been underscored by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who joined an isolated anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its program and “chaos”.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not engaged in world wars to submit to us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to say to reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, this is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and get us elected first and foremost.
“Abandon Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to “feel the pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to fool Brexit and we’re telling them today, “We’re not going to let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the crowd: “I wish you would feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that has allowed us to win the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have brandished Conservative banners against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of security concerns regarding party enforcement at the start of the conference.
"They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running in the presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running in the presidential election after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which involves having a woman head of state.”
Arrest on Sims's death by bullet from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death of basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who appeared in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to being on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody in East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 2m boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to the world title after the team's directives allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became apparent from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and swept Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to plunge into the torment at the peloton’s tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes went through the stands a lap later and found themselves behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of holding out after a double defense attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while keeping his tyres to aim for a speeding finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands in the 44th lap, but was unable to speed up the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an outstanding job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were “wicked, disgusting and dishonest.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the leaks and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I did not disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the senator’s impression.
Feinstein received a letter last July from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I did not cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not appear to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all means.
You see the meanness, the meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars wiped out their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday with a 5-3 return to Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the equality before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing their victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had defeated Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put himself in Cownie's service at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the night towards the end of the first period.
The local team came together and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead of the game for the first time at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died helping hundreds of people who were on board a plane to escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the area and a large number of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance sheet would continue to be heavy because many bodies were still under the rubble and a large number could not be rescued,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man disappeared after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the plane that was flowing.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats participated in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” says Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others had been able to slip into the water until the plane's emergency exits were sinking.
He claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a wharf also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to the mainland before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The indictment adjourned his case Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be before the jury within the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins in political messages and social issues.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a “racist” text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was “still a Black.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecutions with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black on arrival for her first day at work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaffe, “uncomfortable,” Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining to her that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was rather expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple in order to obtain compensation for her removal and is seeking $350 per day in compensation for the six-month home service for which she was originally hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after he was wronged.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Likening the trial to “extortion,” Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you go after someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would remain optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn’t pretentious,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds at something: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect her to get out of it,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly running out of his system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take the shot.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there’s a training effect.”
Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, has lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t have eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they had to get out of it: "It's tearing for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go forward and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for – a limited investigation in time, limited in scope – maybe we could bring in a little unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans score poorly as expected, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to cast the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of Deserters 'falling' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions occurred last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang as part of talks focused on the pending denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked to death, evoking his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling the allegations concerning him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, as he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he treated Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit in the courtroom where he’s currently sitting,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh eluded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't this wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was frame somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was that I had been grabbed by the skin of my neck by an old woman - a cold director who had always terrified me - who came in a little way.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a maturely thought-out decision,” she confided to me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in contention, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, it was late in fundraising, and so swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, only expected to give her $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions—gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism—she felt it.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled about the media’s reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing retaliated in kind, recently hitting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China is committed to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon falter.
To push Washington back is to give in to demands, but to give in publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously recognized,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘prepared’ for refugees’ return, foreign minister says
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the bar of 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in trouble for most of the tournament, plunged his starting shot into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, handing his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was dismissed 5 to 4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, bowed 2 and 1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today, it’s stronger than me.
It was an eventful year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help them,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a moment where we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.

Red tide info point: Concentrations drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – leading to fears of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
There are islets about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County or low concentrations in that bottom county, and low concentrations in that bottom county.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
