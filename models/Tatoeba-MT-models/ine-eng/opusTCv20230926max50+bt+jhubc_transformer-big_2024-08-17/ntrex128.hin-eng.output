AM of Welsh (Member of Legislative Assembly) is concerned about 'images like a carpet'
The suggestion among some members of the assembly is that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (MP of Welsh).
The reason for this is that the Welsh Parliament has been planned to change the name of the assembly.
All the AMs involved in politics are concerned that this could be a joke to them.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned about "not being linked to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
One plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and he has suggested other options.
A political party in Welsh said its group was "independent" about the name change, but it noted that the MWP could be morphed into words by making small verbal changes.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is done exactly as the letter u is done in Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Legislative Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a legal draft on the name change, said: "What the members of the Assembly are called upon to say, the final decision of any whistleblower in this regard will certainly be his own matter for the members."
As per the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was briefed on the results of public consultation on the proposals in which the Welsh Parliament had received much more support by changing the name of the assembly.
In the case of the title of AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but found the most support in public advice for the MWP option.
Apparently, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but with a lot of difficulty in getting the general consensus for the presidency officer Allen Jones, he hopes they will submit the legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes to the methods of work in the Assembly, including the format of rules and committee system for disqualification of AM, will also be included in the law making being prepared for the changes.
When discussing law-making, AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called upon to say.
The people of Macedonia are going to vote to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not.
A bid was made for a popular vote to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, a province of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour speaks of its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
On the name change, a rival of the popular vote, the Macedonian president says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the referendum have argued that the name change is only a gesture of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing lower due to the shrinking churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, "For the history-related things that I spoke to the elders, they say that before, there were more and more churches on every nook and cranny."
"Today, everything is coming to an end."
He said that it is understandable to reduce the bar.
"""The society of today's people is being formed in a different way."
"Bars are no longer like the neighboring living rooms where people go every day."
For churches, they worry that spending on the money they sell won’t last much longer than leaders expect, “and soon that money will run out or later those leaders will come to the exact place where they started.”
He further added that it may be that the churches have been converted into owner-occupied apartment buildings with various kinds of people living there, which will not help to keep the remaining places of worship safe.
He said, "There will be a growing number of people in these buildings who are actually buying houses built in it, and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because there is no possibility that more of them will become members of these.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin's, both churches were built by the white people of religious society before Harlem became the black metropolis - the metropolitan community.
The original white people of Methodist religious society moved into the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who used to worship at nearby places of worship.
A black religious society under the Reverend John Howard Johnson on St. Martin that had led to the removal of retailers on 125th Street, this place was the main place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to being hired or promoted.
The building was badly damaged due to a fire in 1939, but an hour's play was started here after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the hour's work "opening doors of fortune for the poor."
The expert who played the hour in July described it as something like this: it's "a cultural heritage" and "a precious historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany NG also noted that this was the world's first hour played by black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who played a very large hour in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder said that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin in the last few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the common leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
Parishes made up of common leaders (the pastors of the area) got the right to vestry (where the stuff of worship is kept) - in the province in July there was concern that the province would demand "fulfillment of achievements" for vestry, even if the craftsmen and conscripts appointed in vestry were not included in the province.
Some pastors of the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured in an attack by a shark while diving to catch a crab.
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old teenager on Saturday and injured him while he was plunging into California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near the Beacon of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard a boy's voice screaming for help and then he reached out to get him out of the water with a group.
"At first, she thought the boy had made a sound in the excitement of catching the cucumber, but then she felt that he was screaming, 'I'm cutting something!'"
I'm going to cut something!"
Hammel said when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire ankle had ruptured.
"I have called out to all of them to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
A teenager has been admitted to San Diego's Reddy Children's Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said in a conversation with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles further stated that the upper part of the victim's knee has been seriously injured.
For the purpose of investigation and security, the authorities have for 48 hours blocked access from the Ponto beach of Casblad to the Swamys beach of Acinitas.
Gilles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to include Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store style by appointing expert assistants with beauty products.
Despite the continued decline in sales of fashion goods and home goods, it will join the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty market with good volume, these large volumes of beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country and if the scheme is successful, the increase will be higher next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time would double the products it offers, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-to-large retailers to some extent.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragence Shop will also check out special features at Sainsbury's's two stores, the first of which was open last week in Croydon, South London and the second at the end of this year in Celli Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visit to the online shopping and local convenience store i.e. the daily reduced turnover of food items in the supermarket.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Cooper, said people like the department store on the outlet would come in more quickly as the supermarket chain is trying to wrestle with more services and discounters with non-food items like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos' outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several stores since it brought the two to the chain two years ago, revealing that the sale of groceries has been boosted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt to bring beauty and pharmaceutical products back to the market by the supermarket had failed.
Sainsbury's had done business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but this combined business had to end due to the way the revenues from drug stores were split in its supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the 281 stores of the pharmaceutical business to the owner of Lloyd's Pharmaceutical Chain for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, after which a new strategy emerged.
It said Lloyds would play a key role in the scheme by adding several top luxury skincare brands to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the shape-color of our beauty products so that we can enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained co-workers who will assist us in providing advice.
We have made the scope of our brand to suit everyone's needs and attractive surroundings and in convenient locations, which means we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones reveals 'disgrace' over <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal for Holly Willubi
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when TV presenter Holly Biluby decided to divest from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den's star Peter Jones, Peter Jones showed up to 'narrative'
Billy doesn't really have time for his homeware and accessories brand.
The two businesses were being compared to Gweneth Paltro's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning performer announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi set herself apart from her alluring lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones - so she could fully focus on her new best-of-breed contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV’s Golden Girl on Tuesday did not give Marlo, Bakinghamshair a tense meeting at Jones’s business headquarters now at Jones’s headquarters in the now-defunct town of Trujillo, Jones admitted that he was detaching from his new deal – worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – that he did not know about it.
The trade was being compared to Gweneth Paltro's brand Goop and was being considered for a doubling of the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million given by Vilubi.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones moved from the UK to go to her one holiday home.
A source said: "Truly was at the top of Holly's priorities ever.
It was being considered its long-term future, which meant that the brand was going to go much further in the next few decades.
His decision has shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could have believed what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to starting.
The warehouse in Marlo Headquarter is filled with goods that are to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of Britain's richest star from this morninging presenter could cause the firm several million losses as it has invested far too much in products such as clothing and homeware, from pillows and candles to homeware and it may even be starting to show up.
This can also lead to a long friendship.
Billy's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close enough to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the last ten years.
Wilubi joined Capt in 2016 and was joined by 52-year-old Jones as chairman in March.
Baldwin has a 40 per cent stake in couples and zones who are spending vacations together at the TV production firm.
Billy has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be placed in place of Ant McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to talk about his business case."
"We've had a lot of discussions and then we've agreed."
He mocked the criticism by saying that the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider him to be "a different person from the president" and would be much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said his appearance in the "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up on anyone."
He said Kim's interest in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, the nuclear-free dialogue was stopped.
After more than three months of the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea's initial "non-response" to the U.S.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to exert pressure to maintain the restrictions.
Trump's rally speech saw him take a much more optimistic view.
"We are committed to building good relations with North Korea,"" he said."
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people are killed.
Now our relationship is very good."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - including completing the rocket test, helping to free hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops back home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It is very easy to remain in the presidency, but 10,000 people from outside the country are trying to join this area, we will only have about 200 people to stop them."
A tsunami and earthquake hit an island in Indonesia, causing hundreds of people to die.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were asked for the incident that they did not need them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been disgusted, no national disaster has been declared, as well as, a condition for providing international aid was also placed.
Ms. Sumbu said, "In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they were not seeking international help, so it became somewhat more challenging."
Still, Save the Children toured Palu together with a team, but it is not yet certain whether other country's employees can come here to help.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were taking stock of Palu's situation and were looking at whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of such situations that repeatedly come to Indonesia, it seems that there is absolutely no preparation for the outbreak of nature in this country.
However, shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Aich, but they are not like shelters lying on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, no matter how damaging the warning may be, this is likely to increase the loss of life.
Whether it’s the best time to tour or not, it’s challenging to get to the middle of many of Indonesia’s islands.
It is always difficult to arrange communications and goods from natural disasters.
The victims of the earthquake are being taken to a hospital in Lombok which is far enough away from Palu and takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo raised the issue of Indonesia's very poor infrastructure for his election campaign and spent enough money to improve roads and railways.
But, Mr. Joko’s administration has become divisive due to the lack of funds as next year’s elections are going to be held again.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made the religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than 10,000 became homeless as Christian and Muslim groups fought each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturis of Liverpool mysteriously leans over to Chelsea to equalise
At London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Daniel Sturges scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from being out of the Premier League.
From a distance of about 30 yards, Sturije got close to Zerdan Shakiri, at that time his team was 1-0 behind Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before taking a long post shot.
His effort went towards the right top corner of the net with the height above the box.
Eventually, the ball fell out of Kappa Arizabalaga's grip and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get in the position to get in touch with the ball and take it as far away from players like Shak as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that the edges were coming and touched once and didn't think too much about it and just shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in halftime after being scored in the 25th minute by Belgium's best player Aden Hajard.
Before the ball reached near midfield and reached the Liverpool half-game, the Blues striker passed Mateo Kovasik in that game.
Kovasik reached the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, he beautifully shot the ball, moving into a thousand boxes.
Thousands emerged from the defence and fired from the net from behind Liverpool's Alison Baker with a shot from the left foot.
Liverpool will now clash with Napoli at the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the number of deaths due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia had risen to 832.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-feet-high tsunami on Friday had caused a number of people to be trapped in the rubble.
Many buildings in the city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, had collapsed, filling the city with rubble.

The statue of Cromwell, built in front of Parliament, recently became the most famous monument, it was re-entered into ‘history’
Its expulsion would be an ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, such as its Taliban, by its radical Puritan followers.
But, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues, there was a strong suspicion that Oliver Cromwell's statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Neither an order was issued for the symbol of the English Civil War nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that in the last century Cromwell would have given up for the works of his ancestor Thomas.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorocroft, Cromwell's excellent representation is evidence of 19th-century ideas and a part of the history of a statue that many still consider commendable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps that's why most people still know him as a defender of the parliament standing against external pressures in the case of the monarchy in the late 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell’s statue remains a private identity in which a glimpse of one side of that division is visible.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable. "
Deadly Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer, Kills Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that only his surname "Yuan" has been identified as the identity of the person, serious injuries were found on his body, his body was found to be stained with blood near the pig-barrel in the market of Liupansui in Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, China's Kinhai province, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pig herds.
He allegedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin, who lives in nearby Yunnan province, to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin died and it was found that the door of a pig-gate was open nearby.
She said that a large male pig was shown in the pig-barge with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, her cousin, nicknamed "Wu," said, "My cousin's feet were stained with blood and completely injured."
The security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market on Thursday at 4.40am to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig who attacked the person was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept closed so that it could not attack any person, although the police collected evidence by taking an assessment of the incident site.
Yuan's family members and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of people being attacked by pigs before.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm, causing a serious injury to the person.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" if they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They cut off teeth and are very searched...they are not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The storm caused heavy rains in the southwestern United States due to the rest of Rosa.
According to the forecast, the storm is weakening due to the cold water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, due to Rosa, there will be floods in North Mexico and South-West America in the coming days.
According to Eastern Time on Sunday, the wind speed in Rosa was recorded at 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m., a Category 1 storm, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Mexico's Punta Euga<0xC3><0xB1>a.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is becoming a strait shape and it is moving towards the western coast of the US. As the Rossa begins on Monday as a tropical storm, the Bay of Biscay is expected to reach the California Peninsula, so much so in the northwestern parts of the US.
On Monday, 10 inches of rain will be caused by Rosa in some parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, the wet coming from the turf in the coming days will bring heavy rains in the south-west combined with tropical moisture.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris flow, and landslides in the desert.
The rainfall rate will be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona, due to much more tropical moisture.
Southwestern areas, especially Arizona, are likely to have 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the low-pitched nature of the tropical rains, there can be much more flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rains, appropriate advice will be given to stay out of the low-lying desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become risky rivers and with the need for clouds as well as strong winds in local areas and dust will blow.
Due to the coming hail, southern California will bring much more rainfall locally in some parts of the coast.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is likely to occur, which may lead to some degree of debris drift and a slippery situation on the roads.
This will be the first rain of wet weather in the area.
There will be some sleet-like thunderstorms in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rains are more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rain in the Fore Corner on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
The temperature in the entire U.S. may fluctuate rapidly throughout the month of October as the Arctic weather cools at this time, but there is plenty of heat in the tropical areas.
Sometimes, due to this short distance, there are strange changes in the temperature.
The remarkable change in the temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the weather will start to warm and the heat will increase.
Most areas of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to have warm weather from October, which can be a wide 80s in some areas of the northeast from the southern plains.
On Tuesday, the temperature of New York City could reach 80 degrees, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting indications that there are plenty of opportunities to stay above the average temperature of the Eastern U.S. in the early six months of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Brett Cavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people attended the Supreme Court hearing of the case of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who has alleged sexual abuse of Brett Cavanaugh, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blesi Chaihi.
Meanwhile, political stalemate was also seen, broadcasters stopped Friday's last-minute Twist: An Agreement Engineer Bai Arizona Sen's regular program. The suit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flack after investigating the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that at a high school party, Cavanaugh had made an effort to get her drunk and take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself saying that he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not readily available.
In addition, Nelson usually has some difficulty in calculating the number of people who see in the offices.
From this perspective, this is equal to the number of spectators of a playoff football game or academy award.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel, which the host considering has been very supportive of Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the entire day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it remained in second place.
There were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
People were more interested in the hearing.
The drama was directed by Fleck who was the central character in the film.
A statement was issued after a term on the part of the office of the Liberal Republic in which it was stated that they would raise the voice on behalf of the Cavanaugh, they came in front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, at that time protesters were shouting to protest the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
When he was being called an addict, at that time he was standing with his eyes bent for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, "Come on, I'm standing here in front of you too."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
They were told, "Have you been brought to power to make many women powerless?"
Fleck said a statement was issued by his office before the elevators closed and said he would be able to keep his word at the committee hearing.
While the Judicial Committee was pushing Cavanaugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But, Flack said, they will do so with full understanding that the FBI will look into the allegations against the nominees next week, which are being urged by the minority Democrat.
Fleck spoke to his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Connes about it.
After interacting with Cones and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck liked the power very much, as it was clearly visible that the Republican would not be able to get a vote without passing the cavanaugh test.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations levelled against Kavanaugh.
Britain's prime minister has accused critics of "politics" over Brexit, saying it was a "political issue".
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics that they should stop playing politics in the European Union and play games with the future of Britain and put their full focus on the national interest.

The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano and reported that 183 gas and ash had been recorded in 24 hours, according to the National Center for Disaster Prevention.
The center was monitored for several shocks and shocks.
Photos posted on social media show that thin layers of windshields were visible in the neighbourhood of a Mexican city like Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake had hit central Mexico, since then, geophysicists have been paying attention to the increasing activity of the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists in Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary.
Six people from Barcelona were detained after clashes between pro-independence protesters with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of opponents joined demonstrations on the first anniversary of being banned from voting for secession in Catalonia.
A group of pro-Nakabposh separatists threw eggs and powder paints at riot police, causing the road to turn black, usually causing trouble for those coming and going.
The police used their batons to control the clash and later also slapped him.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "no forgetting, no apology" while federal protesters chanted "Spain is immortal."
According to a local press report, fourteen people who were injured due to the performance were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 poll, which was deemed illegal, has been raising tensions in independent-minded areas for a year, but people with separatist views in Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters for freedom chose a very good way, although there were few people who strongly opposed the vote against secession.
When police were trying to stop people from moving on to polling stations in the area in the midst of the clashes, about 1,000 people were injured last year, officials in Catalonia said.
The freedom-supporting groups had stayed there all night on Friday to help the National Police to stop the protest.
The protest went ahead, but he had to be forced to take a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Terminus, had arrived with his wife to take part in separatist protests, saying he did not see any prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents expressing happiness by voting, but it seems like we're stuck now," he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia struggled to maintain influence this year with many of their famous leaders, whether in exposing themselves or organizing the polls and advocating for their continued declaration of independence.
Mechanic Joan Puig, 42, who recorded the protest on his phone to assist the police, said the clashes between the politicians on both sides had been halted.
He said, "It has become too stressful. "
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, who has been one of the nine leaders of Catalonia involved in pre-trial detention since last year's last time, announced that they would fight in next year's European Parliament elections.
Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
London: People who were attacked at home by a car have been arrested

Deputy Inspector Bob Blamings said that the doors and buildings of the house were damaged.
In some places, the car may have been attacked by a crossbow.
Menga beat Livingstone by 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the EBROX club, Livingstone was quick to surprise the Rangers, forcing Steven Gerard to take responsibility for only his second loss in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side move equalled in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side stayed one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders of Hearts next Sunday, trailing by eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Meanwhile, last month when Kenny Miller replaced Holt as head coach, Livingston has consistently won in the six-game division.
Livingstone missed out on showing his game to the visitor
The Holt team should have gone ahead a long time before scoring, as well, because of their great game Rangers had a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but stayed behind with the effort to score, then Alan Lithgo could have done his best to just be direct so that the goal could be completed in Craig Hulkett's header.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor at risk on set pieces.
And because of that, he scored a big goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston did the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson did the job of setting up Menga, who took a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was far behind,
The pattern also continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly being saved.
Scott Pitman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgo completely captured the game by flicking from the other Livingstone.
Crosses in the Livingston box kept coming and going until the goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after the Hulket challenge, one of which involved bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on the handball.
Analysis of Livingstone's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland's Aladdin Lamont was inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena
The extraordinary performance and results of Livingstone.
For any person, they were excellent, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His playing style and personality have changed surprisingly since his return from the top flight, but most of all the credit goes to Holt's style in which he has given the team a new twist since his arrival.
There were a lot of great players.
Captain Hulkett was a great player, he served brilliantly, while Menga kept Conner Goldson and Jo Warl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in the rangers.
The kind of great performance he has done under Gerard several times, they were lower than his standards.
Their final ball was short - they had only once been able to cut towards their home side open - and it was like a few wake-up calls for Rangers, who kept themselves in the middle-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's welcome in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), smiles spread but did not gain any benefit.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO's allies.
He became embroiled in controversy on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the most populated areas in Turkey.
Police stopped a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposing Erdogan - some of whom were also Kurdish - also chanted slogans, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protest saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero and others who insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Biker dies due to collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident took place at about 10:15 BST in the south-eastern area of the city, near the junction of Deptford's one-lane street Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him primary care, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run in Childrens Street, about a mile away from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and provide information to his relatives.
Such incidents are taking place due to road bends and bus diversions and vehicle drivers have been advised to avoid going to such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured Due to Misconduct
Six jail officials have been injured due to the disturbance in the jail of men with high security, the jail office said.
There was some disturbance in Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and it is still going on.
Specialists to fix the mess have been called "Tornado" officials, this mess is in a wing in which eight prisoners have been kept.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the place of occurrence which was treated.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been put in place to fix the accident taking place in HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and may be imprisoned.
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that a prisoner attacked the governor of the prison, after which the governor of the prison was treated in the hospital.
In addition, riot officials were called to jail in October last year to fix a serious disorder, during which an employee was attacked from the pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa poses a risk of rapid flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dry areas may benefit)
The threat situation in the tropical areas has remained after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but there is already a good chance that it is the same one that will affect the remaining capacity of this storm in the coming week, which can cause much more damage to the Desert Southwest.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, are expected to experience rapid flooding.
The rains on Monday evening are expected to make a direct exit from the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service, located in Phoenix, tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression since the 1950s!"
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm's edge.
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that Arizona's Mogolon rim can rain up to 2 to 4 inches, as well as, it is also expected to have up to 6 inches.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin, as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, are likely to have rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, as well as, its expected to be up to 4 inches.
Outside of areas at risk of rapid flooding, rain from Rosa may prove beneficial as the area is dry.
However, the flood has remained a matter of very serious concern, but the drought situation in the southwest is still very likely to benefit much from the rain.
According to the U.S. Draw Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is much too dry, it's the second-highest-grade drought," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
The maximum air speed of Hurricane Rosa on Sunday morning was 85 miles per hour, at that time it was 385 miles southwards from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it is currently moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region, due to which its power is diminishing.
Thus, it is hoped that the power of the tropical storm could cause an earthquake situation in Mexico at noon or at night on Monday.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rains are likely, which can increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by Weather.com, "It is expected that the market from California could rain down to 3 to 6 inches in northwest Sonora, as well as, it is also expected to be 10 inches."
After that, Rosa will go all over Mexico before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, becoming a tropical storm, after which it will head south into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The most dangerous market from Rosa or its remaining parts is California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rainfall is likely," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that due to these rains, there is a threat to public wealth due to rapid flooding and landslides in the deserts and mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found injured, was attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in connection with the plot to murder.
The teenage boy was found injured in the exclave of Teresus area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is said to be "well."
Aven and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight from the Redstock area.
Officials have also appealed to people to contact them if a person has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump called Kavanaugh's plight an anger of the Democratic Party.
Speaking at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, "Judge Kavanaugh is a person who has been rejected by the Democratic Party's ruthless and insulting strategy."
Trump says the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is a result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for the matter in which Christine Blasey Ford accused him of having sexually assaulted Ford several decades ago at a young age. While clearing, Kavanaugh has vigorously and emotionally taken full advantage of the matter.
Ford also testified about the charge during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, "The residents of the United States saw on that day the virtue and courage of being the best man of the Kavanaugh."
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote means giving a vote to a person who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, he can confirm the law and do justice with the real record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
"Now there are only five weeks left, from the election that is the most important for our lives.
I'm not involved in it, but in reality I'm involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are truly eligible."
Trump said the Democrats were on a campaign to "oppose and block."
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the first vote count on behalf of the Senate in Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunamis kill hundreds of people, death toll rises
Officials said on Saturday that when a huge earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu city in which hundreds of people gathered, after a six-meter (18-foot) high wave rose in the evening, causing devastation, causing the deaths of many people and the loss of everything around them.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta, said: “Yesterday, when there was a risk of a tsunami, people present in the meantime were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately.”
Nugroho said, "Sunami not only caused the death of people, but also dragged on the ground wrapping cars, logs and houses. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph)
Some people climbed trees and defended themselves to avoid the tsunami, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Pictures posted from the aircraft by the Disaster Agency showed that many buildings and shops had been destroyed, bridges had been overturned and collapsed, and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the post-coastal assault continued on the rocks in the coastal city.
2.4 million people in the area have experienced a continuous earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy capacity of the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the city's geography at the end of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho elaborated on the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people have not been identified, he said.
Nugroho said there is likely to be much more damage and loss of life in the area called Dongala, located 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, near the earthquake centre.
Nugroho said the communication system in the nave was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its employees and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
"This is a sad incident from the beginning, but it can be even more terrible,"" it said."
The agency on Saturday criticised why it had not been informed earlier if the tsunami was to arrive in Palu, though officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already gone.
Created some videos by a person amateurly and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was giving a voice to a person present on the street below and a terrible warning can be heard in it.
Within a few minutes, much more water began to come out of the middle and the buildings and cars also pulled along with them.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut the lines of communication making it difficult for officials to combine defence efforts.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials have started sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that people still need to take out and meet the food as well as other requirements.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will be closed in October.
President Joko Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
Its awful.
Mr. Doseba said that the World Vision staff located in Dongagala made every effort to secure the city of Palu, the employees have been living in it by making a tent with tarpaulin in the precinct of their office, they have seen the vision of this disaster with their own eyes.
He said, "Talking to him, it turned out that he saw a lot of houses being destroyed."
Its awful.
Aid groups began the work of bringing goods for disaster relief seriously, with some people filing complaints that outside aid workers who have acquired special expertise are being barred from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesia's rules, money from abroad, no goods and the help of staff can be taken only when the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
But that has not been done yet.
Aulia Ariani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia, said the disaster is still at the provincial level.
"After it is said by the government that okay, this is a national disaster, only then we can involve international aid personnel in the rescue operation but that has not happened yet."
Even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami that came on Friday, people in Palu who did not know their friends and family members, were expected to meet their loved ones miraculously somewhere, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was discovered that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team pulled a woman out of the rubble on Sunday, while her child was trapped in the rubble for two days.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gandon Subando, trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to find out who lost, which was dedicated to it in Indonesia since the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally depressed,"" he said."
Mr. Gandon said that only after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse came to light, the paragliding community started their work, sending messages through WhatsApp to the Palu contestants participating in the festival in between.
Yet, only gray marks appear on their message, not blue marks on it.
"I think that means that messages can't reach people,"" he said."

In a news release, Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money.
When he was busy with his work, only "someone ran behind the employee of Brink" came and ran away with a bag of money kept to put.

Kanye West: Rapper changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
Regarding the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Formally his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has kept his name for some time and will use the name for the title of his eighth album Monikar, which was released in June.
This change is being made in his presence at Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to start his new album's anniversary.
The show's producer said he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his existing professional name, West had already stated that the word has religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'this' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
"Therefore I am you, I am we, it is we."
This word is taken from Kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it reflects our good, our evil, our delusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has several names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Daddy, but this year he has kept his name Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of West's, Jay-Z (JAY-Z) has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will no longer use this sworn-in military force for civilian citizens if he completes 50 years of the country for deadly retaliation against the students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday promised that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, on the peaceful movement taking place in the plaza, soldiers fired shots in which more than 300 people died, at a time when the leftist student movement was spreading throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexico's youth, they will grant scholarships to students every month and open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to the lack of employment and education opportunities, young people join the ranks of those who commit crimes.
The U.S. should double the funds given to the A.I.
Since China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of spending on research in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, a low-income investor for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
After several works by the U.S. government, AI has commented, also saying that there is a lack of overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year, China launched a plan: It aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Duplicateing the AI research budget will give a good start, look at all the different other countries, so the U.S. is far behind in this matter, and we are trying for AI's next success," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Duplicateing the fund could double the likelihood that AI will be the next big achievement in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by the Hutton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the best AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the American Othello player with the highest rank far behind, and later he was appointed executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google's China Branch.
Lee described the technical capabilities of the previous U.S. government better, including the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
"It's not China removing academic leaders, it's corporate,"" Lee said."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that by changing the immigration policy, the U.S. can get help in its AI efforts.
"I think you should get permission to do a PhD in AI with a green card,"" he said."
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) Development Plan.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides financial grants to researchers from the U.S. in the same way that funding is given to the people of the Academic Institute, but the quality of the education works in China is not very good," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next that involved an investment of $2 billion.
For NSF, this investment is now more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a law was enacted in the U.S. that would take months to consider the demand to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country or not
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, a task that would resolve decades-old disputes with Greece, due to which Greece was a member of the European Union and NATO.
There is also a province in Greece named Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor is named on its territory, giving it two names for the same claim and that it is already part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and would boycott the campaign, he doubted that the minimum 50 per cent vote required for this vote would be valid.
The question will be written on the ballot: "Do you give your approval for the agreement to be with Greece for NATO and EU membership?"
Supporters of Prime Minister Zoran Zev, as well as the name change, say that it is important for Macedonia to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that has emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, so they will be able to live independently in the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievaska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
However, there is no legal emphasis on this, most members of Parliament say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed for a name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no reports of irregularities had been received till 1 p.m.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gojo Tnevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorika and son Dushko, voted in Macedonia to change the country's name to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Stromica, Macedonia.
54-year-old Vladimir Kvardarkov, who lives in Skopje in front of Parliament, was preparing a small stage and was putting up chairs in front of the tent he had put up for those who are opposed to this vote.
"We need NATO and EU membership, of course, but we want to join it by raising our heads, not through an agreement," Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own dignity.
If they don’t want to subscribe us on behalf of Macedonia, no matter what, we can become part of Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia.”
Prime Minister Zev has said that getting membership in NATO will give Macedonia a very important investment, the unemployment rate here is more than 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zev said, "I think we will get a lot more positive votes because more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
Last Monday, a survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia showed that 30 to 43 per cent of voters would vote in the necessary polls.
A second poll conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia on Sunday showed that 57 per cent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agree to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent voting is required to be successful.
If the vote fails, the Western government's policy on voting in May last year will be the first serious blow.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rehim Sterling made enough defense against Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England.
Ridiculously, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The striker of Argentina was passed in the middlefield in the first round.
On entering the open field, he defended against three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He punched a defending player before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
In the box to return the ball to Aguero, English Forward used his first touch, Aguero beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan by using his left boot and the ball went off to the net on his right.
"City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, ""There have been some problems at Eguero's feet that he is upset about."
"We talked about their game for 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they had scored at the same time.
But, it was due to Sterling who brought Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball from Leroy Sen's left side beautifully.
Sen made a few touchdowns before sending away the good-playing Sterling.
Just before the game's hand slipped, Sky Blues taped the ball forward.
In the Champions League Group Play, the match will now be played from Hofenheim at 12:55 p.m. in Sinsheim, Germany's Rhine-Neckar-Erina.
Shearer wants to beat him by playing against the Rockets.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no big reason to push for another start.
But, the always-competiting skater hopes that on Sunday he will score big against the Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for the Rockies still remain just a possibility, he has won in the game to be played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored a wild-card spot by recording a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win the first division title.
"Even though we're not playing very well, we can at least play to know that the crowd and team environment of Denver will probably be for the highest level of play I'll face this year."
Why wouldn't I want to play that game?"
Nationals are still left to tell about the starter for Sunday, but are coming to hear that Shazer could be included in such a situation.
Shazer, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander remained at 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in the 220 2/3 innings of the season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court to Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be at stake in November.
There are now only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a very big election - I'm not involved in it, but really I'm involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates."
"You can take a look at this much more horrendous radical group of Democrats, you can see all the things that are happening right now," Trump said.
In addition, they are trying to seize power by using other necessary means, which you know is pointless and pointless.
To get power and control, they don't care who's sad, who's capable, they just want power and control to get them, but we won't let that happen."
He said that the campaign of the Democrat is "to put the opposition and obstacles."
"Besides, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrat you saw and also see how mean and bad they are," he said.
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he referred to the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, whom the audience appreciated in a strong way.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
What?
No, no, I'm waiting for something - whose body language was really bad - that bad body language I saw for the first time.
Work is no longer a large church.
It is not worth it for those who speak their minds.
When the workers who led my local party voted to elect me, it was a huge surprise to me.
After all, I am the youngest among those Labour MPs whose importance has remained quite low - we can't say all the things of our mind.
My MP colleague Jon Ryan was also here because he also raised the voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were similar problems in Europe in a way that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
"We want all things to be included in the meeting and it will be beneficial,"" he said at the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday."
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I saw most of the time here that Friday Night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of “kind and generous people” are really forgotten, happened here too.
It is clear that if the views in the Labour Party are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration it is decided whether this party is acceptable to the leadership or not.
It started here immediately after Jeremy became the leader, for the colleagues I had previously thought had political views like me, they started expecting me to turn my words around and work in positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or whether it was the right thing to do.
Whenever I raise my voice to the public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - bad words are seen on social media, sharp remarks are made about it, the politics of the center is condemned and I'm told that I'm not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way businessmen work and am dedicated to those colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don’t shy away from raising their voices.
In today’s political era, there are many disappointing aspects, one of which is how levels of abuse are normalized.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and the changes in every proposal of "unbelief" or the party's selection rule have been very minor.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to keep quiet, not talk too much, and then I will be “right.”
But I didn’t go into politics for it.
32 years ago when I was working as a school student, I was encouraged to oppose the Thackeray government, I was asked to leave the wider class of my school entirely, I demanded to provide better public services to those who needed them most - regardless of location.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no person in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any areas of disagreement about my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that harms homes, businesses and our public services, I do not feel the need to waste my time and energy in showing my honesty to the Labour Party.
But, in reality, I have a message that is not for the Nottingham moment, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud of the fact that I am serving you and I promise that in my work any kind of extraordinary risks or political campaign obstacles do not just bother me.
Chris Lesley Nottingham is the former MP.
Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Reach the Unbeatable Iron Top
The two late attempts may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Air Tenant deserved to win in this best entertaining match of the premiership.
Now they are only at the top of the table of ten unbeaten sides.
In the end, his defense was the best he could find as good an opportunity as he could, which is why he pushed the domestic team forward and gave coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We did a thorough investigation of our game and we are still undefeated, so it makes me happy," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie said: "Its credit goes to Eire, who gave as much credit to his opportunity as possible."
Grant Anderson's effort in the 14th minute forced Frazier Klimo to come face to face with Eire, but the Warriors gave the Scottish player Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggins a lot.
With the help of penalty just before half-time, Klimo extended the ice, he scored and then tried to single out the match from 17-5 for the ice at the time of break.
But Melrose did better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort turned Baggot into a goal, reducing the five points of the draw.
After that, Ruridih Nott suffered a serious injury which caused him to stop the game for quite some time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game Ire went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowell which Climo converted into a goal.
At the time, Ira's team captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow card, and after that due to a lot of pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an effort to extra-man Bruce Calvin who failed to earn it.
However, the host team stayed behind and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to facing the billa ball's climax from the penalty line-out, McPherson pushed Eire forward and touched down.
After being sent away by Kelly Rowe to collect David Armstrong's box kick and send Flanker Greger Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home side, Climo turned it into a goal, as they could do when the game restarted.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
The game's star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to go into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was chosen to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is linked to the Jarvis famous BBC show, in which he writes and co-stars in the acting of comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
Both have said that the upcoming ninth series of the show will be their last series in the world, and it seems that they are planning what to do to Kernan after Craigslist.
Based on the official record list, they are the directors of Adriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, however, a Scottish Sun source warned that Kernan was looking to join a "greater restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We Have Our Right to the Sea': Land-locked Bolivia Hopes Court Will Reopen Path to Pacific
The military-Navik are patrolling the Naval Headquarters of La Paz on a large scale.
The Ocean-Blue flag is being hoisted on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, here's a slogan from the Naval Base: "We have the right to the sea."
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which lost Chile in a terrible land dispute in the 19th century, is still desperate to find its land - they want to once again chart their way into the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope to regain the land of their Bolivia decades ago, as it is waiting for a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm now in Bolivia, there is a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is going to have a positive outcome," said Roberto Calazilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people in Bolivia will see the ICJ’s big decision on the big screen across the country, they are full of hope that the decision that will come from the court of The Hague will be in favor of Bolivia – which has been in talks for decades – Chile has been forced to withdraw to the sea through negotiations.
Bolivia's best president, Evo Morales - who is set to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - has also voiced his positivity in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he had said, "We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in the interest of Bolivia - and if the decision also comes in its interest, there will be enough conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to award the Chilean province, and it has decided that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
Chilean expert Paz Zet told the International Court of Justice that the ICJ's decision was to come six months after the final hearing, indicating that the case was "not complex."
In addition, apart from the conditions of Bolivia, it seems for the last four years that it can come back to the old position.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia,"" Jarrett said."
He suggested that the controversial statement by Morales has ended Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision is made.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's country.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, who is present at the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually somewhat too hasty.
He said on Monday there would be "a better opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new ties with Chile" and it would be an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Calazilla has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicizing the maritime issue.
“Bolivia will never back down for its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
"The decision is an opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear inspections will not be stopped until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said his country will not destroy its nuclear bomb unless Washington is trusted.
Ree gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the other country.
He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong-un's talks in Singapore.
Ree said it was a "pipe dream" that would see North lose to sanctions and U.S. opposition to the announcement of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consent of the already ongoing major disarmament campaign without Pyongyang's announcement.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want another summit.
But, it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb because it does not want to put the country’s security at risk.
Kim-Trump is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit to be held at the will of the two.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of new design headwear for your near high street.
If you have to increase your hat collection or completely save your head from sunlight, then there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown designers have created a series of the best headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway which is featured in the famous Paris Fashion Week of particular style.
The best beneficial hats are made to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent out their beautiful creations to show off in the show.
The best hats made by Valentino were quite large, he was decorated with that wide brim like wings that hung all over the model's head.
The much-oversized second-side accessory featured beige design-made water-lemon hats, Wizard hats, and pin-apple-designed hats - but they weren't built to protect your head from frost.
Tom Brown also showed off specially designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see a lot of colorful masks and things like nibble lecturers were seen more than Houtte Couture.
In one creation, all kinds of equipment for scuba diving were seen, including snowballs and glasses, while in the other creation, the design was seen with melted ice cream cones.
Also, if you've seen too much fashion - then you're lucky.
Style-seeing enthusiasts estimate that this excellent collection may soon reach the fine shops around you.
The very large-sized hat will come with a ‘La Bomba’-designed heel, allowing everyone from the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski to buy it.
Behind the best-performing hat was a cult label that looked pretty beautiful, shown with the second creation catwalk posted on social media – featuring a model wearing a swimming suit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia fringing and fitted with a white leather handle, it was the best attraction of Jacobs’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
"Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told the email: ""I hope the big hats and bags in between will arrive soon for the upcoming summer season - because the designers have been so impressed with it that they have unpacked the large-size accessories."
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the best education records, and since 2018 it has continued to give the best exam results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under whose leadership these schools are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting the citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages in schools continue to be chosen as a well-known and desired subject option.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you speak to him in his own language, his heart is very good.
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can rely more on English.
In this year's exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest passing rates in private schools.
68% of them are students who have achieved the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of SCIS can be seen in 72 per cent of students who achieved the highest grade A in the Mandarin language, while 72 per cent of students who achieved the highest grade A in the German language, 69 per cent of students who achieved the French language and 63 per cent of students who achieved the Spanish language grade A.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills they will need in the future.
As an alternative subject, languages are now joining the curriculum of private schools and other things like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled hard enough to hire employees in the vacant positions, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming mandatory to have more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are necessary to work anywhere in the world due to the higher potential employment opportunities required by the language.
No matter why any career option is not chosen, if people have learned a second language, such skills will surely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, then because of being a multilingual person you will be ahead of yourself in the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey, according to which 75 per cent of people could not speak enough foreign language and only French was the subject that 15 per cent of people could speak and it was the only language that reached double-digit percentage.
This is why it is important for children to invest in language learning.
With the knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding the right job.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach those languages whose approach is towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter why your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed so they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot yet be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages really should be accepted as "international communication skills."
Young people in Scotland will continue to be given the choice to choose this option, diversity and excellence by private schools.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held quite a rally for the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Next week, Trump has decided on five more rallies including Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable spots.
With the Supreme Court suspending the vote set for appointment to the vacant post in its election, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election as there is a risk of Congress getting out of control of the Republic at the time of counting of votes in November.
When will Trump's rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how will you see it online?
The timing of the Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidates can give a Trump speech on this week's hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, the confirmation of the expected Senate vote for a week during the probe into allegations of sexual misconduct on Kavanaugh has been barred.
But, the main goal of this stressful rally rally is to help the Republic to face the elections that will take place in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, "The goal of these five rallies next week is to protect and increase the majority of those detained in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Republican effort is full of volunteers and supporters."
According to Reuters, the spokesman who has been removed from the Trump campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to their agenda that the president will visit only those states where our campaign season will be very busy."
According to West Virginia Metro News, "Determined in Wesbaanco, Wyoming's Arena, the attention of Ohio and Pennsylvania's supporters from tonight's rally can be brought to the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, having received more than 40 percent of the vote from the area in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, a candidate who is behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate poll.
Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: "If the president is trying to give Maurice a lead in the election, it's not a good sign for him."
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to compete so that the hopes of staying at the top in the Sunday singles can be maintained
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will see the result of what is going to happen in this rider's cup.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions such as these when which player to go ahead and which player to trust.
So, what will they say about this moment?
"He had a six-point lead, which is now four points, so I think we have to increase our pace a little bit," Speth said.
Of course, Europe benefited and outperformed four points by 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they have a few more opportunities left and have a lot to encourage, not only from Spieth’s form but also from Justin Thomas’s form, who played together all day long and both got three points out of their game.
Spieth is deadly to everyone from tea to green and is also the best in the game.
As their game progressed, the crowd cheered with cheers, and when they and Thomas went two more points down, the four all-squares were a crucial set to complete.
Because of his putt, his team came in 15th position with the same scree, sort of telling you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
"You really just have to play well and keep in mind that winning is yours,"" Spieth said."
That's what all the players who are out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas whose names are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, they are making new history in the Riders' Cup.
With different styles of Europe but better couples scored four points in four and are at the forefront.
There was a lone couple on Saturday afternoon who didn't shoot a bogey, but they stayed away from bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings until before 9 a.m.
On Sunday, he found the way to get that run and that run in this strong crowd and from this strong crowd as if they were the bettors, and there is no player who could turn the potential victory of the European team into a loss. It would seem that the Sun of Le Golf National would have been earlier than Fleetwood or Molinary.
It is good that the two are on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of the Europeans is already being talked about.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at which time their pairing was made with Alex Noreen.
One bogie and two doubles in front of the nine doggs were scored by Spaniard and Swede, before they had never even been able to reach.
However, there was no one present on Sunday to help you get to your hole.
The foreplay and foreplay were very good on sight as the interaction between the pairings was pretty good, he advised that they don't need to take advice and that they are well-acquainted with how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead in the last day, but this fortnight session also showed that the team has the ability to fight in a way that is suspicious, especially in the Stateside.
On the last day of the Rider Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
The Riders will take advantage of this in a good way on the last day of the Cup after the 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday.
The best pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, who are struggling with two wins so they can take their match far beyond the four points of the Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Bejorn took over at the European side's morning foray into the tournament due to American side's misfiring in the European side's morning for revenge for his loss to the trophy in Hazeltine, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the forts by recording a win in two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Fury's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match to maintain the trophy win.
Fleetwood are the first European stops to win four points in a row, while he and Molinary started with "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Rider Cup history.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreball, he again beat Woods and American Rookie Bryan Deshambus by 5 and 4 points, performing better than ever before to lose.
Woods, who led the pack through two games on Saturday, showed his best performance, but has now faced defeats 19 times in his 29 matches of Foreplay and Foresam and seven matches of Cry.
In the rest of the remaining morninging four-ball, Justin Rose returned to the fora with his partner Henry Stanson and beat the world's rank one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, the Pleistocene in the south west of Paris, Breeze Day had no break with Europe.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set up a benchmark for the American by scoring two points.
He scored a brilliant 2-1 win over Spain's John Rehm and Ian Polter in the foreball and sent Pauls and Rory McLeroy back 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has only happened twice in the history of the Rider Cup when a team came back from a match reaching the singles by getting four points, although the kind of side Fury needed kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to happen, as if it is different from their old game.
North Korea says 'there's no way' to denuclearize will be just one side it can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations had continued to impose sanctions that relied on its disbelief in the United States and showed no way for the country to stop monitoring the nuclear bomb on its own behalf in such circumstances.
Ree Young Ho, at the Annual General Assembly of the World Body, said that last year North Korea had tried a number of methods of testing weapons that were associated with "significant sympathetic methods", such as, stopping the testing of nuclear bombs and missiles, testing nuclear bombs and firing nuclear weapons.
"However, we have not received any response from the US for this,"" he said."
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way in which we can begin unilateral disarmament."
While Ree reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea in view of disarmament are about Washington's "stepped-up" approach under which North Korea will gradually benefit, it is clear from his statement that this unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral unilateral ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
For the first time, at the summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader, which was held in Singapore on June 12, Ree referred to the statement jointly made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which point Kim took action in the direction of the "demilitarization of the Korean peninsula".
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang should first stop making its own nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call for an end to strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has firstly stressed disarmament and increased the level of pressure of sanctions so that it can achieve its objective forcefully, and at the same time, it has also objected to the "declaration of the end of the war."
"Restrained can bend us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that our confidence is getting even lower with the constant ban."
Ree did not discuss any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had boasted of the UN's qualities last week.
Instead, the minister discussed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and further explained: "If the party is South Korea for this disarmament problem and not the U.S., then the disarmament of the Korean peninsula is not included in such an approach."
Still, Ree's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said about the UN National Assembly that targeting the U.S. Mainland with North Korea's rocket after Trump called "Rocket Man" on the suicide mission.
In this year's United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage to step up for disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and the ban would remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for doing so, "if it takes two years, three years or even five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are debating whether Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps to be taken by the U.N. Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council that "the Security Council's ban should remain in place until without any failure we realize that we are completely, last and verified disarmament."
The Security Council has extended restrictions on North Korea with full consent in 2006 to deposit funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ree at the U.N. General Assembly and then told her that he would return to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, condemning him for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
North Korea has vowed to destroy the missile site this month and if the United States takes "consistent action," it will also destroy the nuclear facility.
He said Kim had promised him "consistent measures" to ensure security so that Trump would take a resolution in Singapore and move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard's students are taking courses for a comfortable enough job.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year that is aimed at all those undergraduates who want to get more and more rest while competing in the growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
A teacher who teaches students at the world's number one university often has no choice when there are absolutely common things to do to relax themselves.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Womens Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of low sleep during teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
He told The Telegraph, "I got a girl at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I always say that's what I have to go to next year's class?'
He said no one told him about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will learn how the good habit of gold is important in study-writing and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barrera, executive director of the University Health Services and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, said students do not get enough sleep each week for which the university has decided to start the course.
A series of interactive tasks has been included in the course, which runs for hours.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell what the effect will be on caffeine and light and to tell about what kind of effect the lack of sleep has on athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep in the daytime.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"""We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately,"" Professor Zesseler said."
But, we believe they should be aware of this - just as smoking has information about the health impact."
He said that a culture of experiencing pride in ‘waking up and reading all night long’ still exists, with increasing pressure on modern technology and students to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep enough and well in bed or not, making sure it is like the students’ ‘secret weapon’, which allows them to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - it also protects against the effects of weight loss because of the lack of sleep that their brain always thinks about hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped build Professor Jessler’s help course, during last year he completed his last year’s class at Harvard.
He said that because of the course, he became aware and inspired for the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that completing this course will be considered essential for all postgraduate students before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Jessler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before going to sleep, as well, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emanating from the electronic screen and the LED light, which can cause a lot of problems.
Livingston vs Rangers 1 - 0: Menga scored against Gerard
Due to Dolly Menga's strike, the Rangers faced trouble in another match, with Livingston's 1-0 win being blamed on Steven Gerard's wrong side.
The Ebro Side were looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in the match played at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team spurred as manager for the second loss from Gerard in 18 games, so that helped lead the Landbrooks Premiership out of the league.
Before half-time, Menga went on a seven-minute strike and after that the Rangers' line-up short didn't even get a chance to equalize the game once.
However, the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, Livingstone has reached third place and is only behind the Hibernian due to the goal difference.
In addition, since the head injury of the Linesman Calum Spans has been treated since the object was obviously thrown to the other end, the game could be even more troublesome for Rangers.
Due to the eight changes made to Gerard's side, the last Irishman got a chance to go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Live 11 that took a point of Hearts last week and the way they drilled in a good way made the opposition team upset at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first sent Scott Pittman to Allen McGregor's goal by late-off, he should have given only two minutes, but Midfielder missed this great opportunity he found.
When Keegan Jacobs was free-kicked in the deep, it went to kick captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo, who was present at the back post, could only spread the stick.
Rangers did gain control, but they were more confident in their game in the final third than they were in the hope.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have penalized the quarter-over mark as they and Steven Lawless had bumped into each other, but referee Steven Thomson had rejected Columbian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots at the target in the first-half, but former IBRO goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with Lasana Colibli's header and the strike of Tweet OV Ejaria.
However, in the 34th minute Livy's opener could have gone against the run of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones entitled to this graph.
Despite this, the Rangers could not beat the best player in the Deep.
When Deccan Gallagher passed Scott Robinson to the ball, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson had kept Menga quiet to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Colebell for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as he slotted by Winger in Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line by running well.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the kind of game they could really enjoy, swiping the long ball along with Lithgo and Hulket after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have boosted his lead, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from well-studied up before Lithgow widened the corner.
Rangers called Glenn Middleton, who was present as an alternative, another late claim for penalty as he had become entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let him succeed again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geyser Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" schedule: 136 years from today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day when the future physical scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a device for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was later known as the Geyser Counter.
Geyser is a major base of counter science, it has become the main base of pop culture, as well as, in 1950, a film "Bells of Coronado" was made on it, in which for the first time scientists Roy Rogers and Del Evans acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "It's a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effect of hidden atoms due to radioactivity in the minerals."
Evan: "Say, it's definitely popping up right now!"
"Hans" Geezer died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
However, due to his invention, his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may ‘see’ the immune system’s bad cells
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system and eliminate them.
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify the bad cells during treatment.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced.
After that, they can ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and then remove it and re-attach it.
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her poor cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that the cancer of her bowel that has been present for more than 18 months is over.
This method can remove and replace a patient's immune cells in the laboratory, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then reattach the cells by removing them.
J. Berzofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very promising."
Pro Berzofsky said that HER2 causes "a variety of cancers," including breast, bowel, lung, and colorectal cancers.
Patients' immune cells are useful in the treatment of a type of leukemia to remove and "direct" them to detect cancerous cells.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would be his government in 2020, he condemned in the studio during Saturday's night live.
After the performance of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he rebuffed the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So, I talk to white people a lot of times and they say, ‘What’s the reason you like Trump, they’re racists?’
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago.”
SNL started the show with Matt Demon's skit, in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee has already investigated the sexual harassment claims made against him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, this was not shown, West's condemnation of the footage was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether or not Rock was trying to blow West's laugh with the posting because of the post.
Along with this, West complained in front of the audience that he was threatened with going to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me with backstabbing.
He said, "Don't wear that hat and go there."
They threatened me!
Besides, he also said that I'm stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see that wrong place?" At the same time, they said, "You can't tell me what to do with my Superman cap. Do you want to move the world forward?"
Love it.'
In his comments, he referred to the audience at least twice and felt the SNL artists embarrassing, in a separate report, one person told the publication: "The entire studio completely shut down."
Singer Ariana Grande was called West due to a delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, the death of Ariana Grande's old Boyfriend rapper Mac Miller a few days ago.
West surprised many viewers by performing the song I Love It, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West again met with TPUSA's lead Candes Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the most courageous people: Thank you for raising your voice for the public."
But, host Karen Hunter of the talk show tweeted that the West is just there "which she told and which is absolutely amazing."
"But, I didn't choose someone who benefited (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is promoting the wrong idea for my community or misrepresenting my community."
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, as well, saying he was just "formally going by the name Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but had previously done so by Diddy and Puffy, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy respectively.
With him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lyon and the late famous Prince of Music also changed his name to Symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as John Snow in HBO's Violet Middle Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such a role on the screen often inspires many young boys and they think it is necessary to do such a difficult job to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married his co-star of Game of Thrones to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, believing she felt "quite firm" in talking about the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?"
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems that appear on the screen?
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he thanked it much more to the male lead character.
He said, "What happens and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the street, young boys begin to believe that they should do something certain to be a man?
In my opinion, it has really become one of the big questions of our time – how can we make a change in it?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong for the minds of the young men.'
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series returns at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well as, he also said that he has done a number of programs with 'War Fields and Horse Riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on a new series of True West by Sam Shepherd, the story of a film producer whose brother is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife daily.
I got my husband through this show, so I believe this show has given me the family of my future and my life has moved on from here.
Rose has played the role of igret, who is the girlfriend of kite character John Snow in the Amy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New cases in China have increased by 14%, according to the report
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the changes that have taken place in recent times, most of the new cases are said to be caused by sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, China's health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV through this had nearly gone to zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex done by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community has enough discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Due to many infections of the disease, there is insufficient protection regarding sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised access to HIV drugs.
Maxin Waters denied that his staff had leaked the data of the GOP senator, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "way to conspire."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters said the allegations made on Saturday were "unfortunate," adding that one of his employees had posted the private information of three Republican U.S. Senators on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by the pandit and website of the "Ultra-Right Wing."
Waters tweeted, "False, false and much more hateful."
Allegedly, the information provided included South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hutch's home address and phone number.
This information was seen online on Thursday posted by an unknown person, Capital Hill, when the Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three senators were questioning Kavanaugh over the leak of some information.
Hill said the address of the IP address of sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, which identify the source of the person posting, was linked to the Waters office and a Waters employee had released the information.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false,"" Waters said."
"Any employee of mine - whose identity, personal information and security is being compromised due to these false and false allegations - was in no way responsible for this information leaking."
This allegation is baseless, completely false and absolutely false.
Waters soon posted online for a clean-up of the criticism, which also included the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"This means that their nature is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not be angry and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should remain calm and have patience. "
It seemed that the answer to Fletcher Waters was being compared to the condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who had been accused of being very angry at Kavanaugh during the hearing on Thursday.
Umar Navarro, the Republican candidate to lose the Waters in the midterm election, also tweeted his views.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a big deal."
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
"We will make sure that the offenders are told whether or not, and that they are held legally responsible for all the acts they have done which are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - The spy action done by Rowan Atkinson was not considered too violent
From the British point of view, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still traditionally seen and it seems to be applicable back to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy Spoof Franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be self-deprecating on the subject of how we certainly treat the nation's new export opportunity as shit?
At any rate, the pop-oriented and rubber-faced disgruntled Johnny English has his license to re-create the base-footed stuff - which is far more famous than anything else by its name alone. He is a wide-ranging comic book actor for those areas.
They are certainly the Duft Secret Agents who managed to show Mr. Bean's Dash Clauso a little bit and a dollop for the champ who has won the London 2012 Olympic Open with the opening of the Cheyenne.
He is originally a traveler and is the international man of mystery whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for Chaos of Wake.
Only one or two good scenes can be seen in this new JE outing.
I liked Johnny English quite a bit in which he was shown going into a helicopter wearing a medieval suit and wrapping a rotor blade on his helmet.
Physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came very little and felt strangely half-baked, especially 007 and Mission Impossible. The film brands themselves work with a whole lot of confidence as a component of comedy.
Laughter comes as if comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings are not at all bearable to me and I've liked Bean more in Atkinson's silent film.
What is always relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The UK's most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, this network has kept the identity of all the UK's working agents that could affect the agent's work - this is a sad event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and rather troublesome Prime Minister, they are already facing many political and unpopular problems: this Quasi-Teresa-May character can play Emma Thompson well, but the script is not dazed to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy has made an agreement, he will have to bring someone who has already retired.
This meant that Johnny English would have to fight for himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but has to work him off-record on what an undercover operative should be like: It has some good comics, as well, rock-typed by the spy.
The Englishman has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for a briefing and Ben Miller's reprised role has been mixed with his rather old-fashioned sidekick buff.
Now that Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is of Jolie-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Paperdine has not been found.
So, in the secret service of his Majesty, Batman and Robin get some very big mistakes when they face the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Cruelenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes under threat from the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he has a solution to Britain’s computer crises: scapegoat Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
The Englishman and the bogeyman begin their odyssey of the vital high-jinx: the waiter sets fire to a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and the Englishman completely activates the chaos when he goes into Volta's house of elves.
The movie has definitely been pulled everywhere for that last sequence, but still it's neat and entertaining, there are plenty of fun things for kids in the whole movie.
of a good middle class.
Also, as I saw in the other Johnny English films, in this film I didn't understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry or not that is really according to his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to work just four days a week for the people of Britain, but the money will be met by five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a pro-democracy scheme in which UK residents will only have to work four days a week - but the money will come in at a rate of five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's owner to give part of the savings through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers so they can get an extra day's vacation.
This will give the employee a three-day leave per week - but still they will be able to get the same pay.
Sources said that such an idea would be "older" with the party's economic agenda and it is planned to benefit the country's workers.
A four-day shift is being promoted by the Trades Union Congress a week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but rather it is expected to take a four-day work week, which is perfectly in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers."
With the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour spokesperson said: "Four-day work week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had used last week's Labour Conference to present his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was confident that power would be restored from "faceless directors" and "munafakhors" in utility firms.
Shaddo Chancellor's schemes also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can 'cut back' on the basis of alleged misdeeds.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on the company's boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, which can get an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy "60 Minutes" Tells Whether the FBI's Investigation of Cavana Can Change Their Minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any chance the FBI would find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy came to a clearer look than his ally of South Carolina.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavana.
After that, when this allegation came out, I called them, asked, ‘Did you do that?’
They were sure, firm, and clear."
However, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a line of stone.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett refused in an eloquent way," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever they called, he could not verify it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it led to a reduction in poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring many highly influential stars, and as influential is its mission; to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes in the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival, as well as the program of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international advocacy group, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the program (except when you are not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert will help to create awareness towards your goal of eradicating poverty. To become a volunteer, to email a world leader, to make phone calls, to do many things like "work from scratch"
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free music program the right way to persuade people to take action, or is there just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people feeling like they were signing the petition online or tweeting in the right way?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, advancing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which are already distributed or cash-generating.
The group estimates that the Safe Fund has so far directly impacted about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and executive partnership, which is committed to helping to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens "promising to contribute up to $35 million to Rwanda"
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
A frequently asked question on your website: “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Genele Monay are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "unbanning" to create barriers to Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington “could use the U.S. Navy if necessary” to curb Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, in Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, unblock them, so as to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing people present at the event hosted by a non-profit group, the Consumer Energy Alliance, who call themselves "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran to saying that they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as "a trickle-down puppet" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "There are economic options, at least, in the case of Iran and Russia, to take advantage of the fuel and replace it."
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, taking the place of Russia, is on a mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, which has made Berlin a "barrier" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
The U.S. position was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kemp, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "When a large state interferes in our energy supply, I am deeply disturbed.
"Elizabeth Warren will ""seriously consider"" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020,"" the Massachusetts senator said."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm election.
During the Town Hall in Holiock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider taking part in the race.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and join our broken government, and that includes being a woman at the top,"" he said."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting the presidential election."
Warren said while assessing President Donald Trump during the town hall, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is ultimately doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court nominees have been vocal in their criticism of Bret Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to have the FBI vetted before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffocating University Political Research Center/Boston Global Poll, eighteen percent of Massachusetts's "potential" voters said the senator should not contest the election.
Twenty-five percent voted in this way.
The survey showed more support in the case of contesting the election by former governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent supported the possibility of participating in the election race and 48 percent were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names to potentially contest the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that they will officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the audience, "Because of what my son is going through, what he is feeling after coming back, I am sympathetic to other families who feel the impact of PTSD and who are suffering from it."
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back hard, they come back thinking whether it's a respect for the country that took their fellow soldiers and airmen, and the other members of the army."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to those fleeing gang violence or domestic violence victims.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a Justice-Friendly Summary Paper in Washington on Friday to support a refugee challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her gang members' sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described Al Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, creating a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law expects that all asylum claims should be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a detention violates that principle," the justice-friend said.
Atorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "Those who leave their homeland due to harassment or fear due to membership of their caste, religion, nationality or a particular social group are available to them."
The shelter was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled as the number of people who died in the search for the survivors
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It feels very stressful," said 35-year-old mother Reisa Kusuma, comforting the child suffering from the bubonic plague at the Tahas-Nahas Palu city exit centre.
"Every minute brings an ambulance to the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their homes, taking up water-soaked goods, trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the earthquake of 7.5 magnitude and the hospital was submerged.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who were facing broken backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated openly outside due to repeated strong earthquake tremors.
His eyes filled with tears as he felt the shocks of a violent earthquake in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was pushed into the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silenced.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' through 'advertising'
A week after running a four-page ad, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to propagate propaganda, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - referred to China Daily's pay supplementation codes in the Des Moines Register, which China accused
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters, was a new step in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen them turn to imposing customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory customs duties were designed to strike exporters in states like Iowa in the first trade war, which had backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the longtime US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China's major exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstead wrote in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is now "doubling that abuse by running a publicity ad in our own independent press."
"In its publicity-spreading, by giving paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstead wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at Newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited unsatisfying voices and there will be no perfect reflection of the discordant opinions that Chinese people may have," he wrote on China's worrying economic watchdog.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided justifying the proposal to publish their article," though he did not name the newspaper.
The Republicans are segregating women voters ahead of mid-term elections with Kavanaugh's defeat, analysts warned
Since top Republican Supreme Court candidates facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment are supporting and defending Brett Cavanaugh, the analyst has warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The sentiments around it are pretty overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be brought back," Grant Reehar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rehar said he doubted that the pressure at the last minute would be enough to pacify angry voters for an FBI investigation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Erizona).
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior adviser to progressive group MoveOn and national spokesperson Karen Jean-Pierre said on Friday, "Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither tomorrow nor in November can they forget it."
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters protesting in the Senate floor were reported to have chanted “November is coming!”, in May.
A non-political analyst, Stu Rothenberg, told the News site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to pull away from the chart."
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it can be even more, especially among suburban women voters and 18- to-29-year-old young voters who don't like the president, often don't vote."
Describing in detail the allegations of sexual harassment by the ford against the Supreme Court nominee, the analysts had already said before public testimony that there is a possibility of protest if the Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said, "It's become a messy mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about putting a committee vote or a final vote or a Cavana on the bench, it's also about how the Republican has handled it and how he's dealt with it," said Gisela New, director of the organization Priorities USA, which helps Democrats in the election.
However, the U.S. appears somewhat divided in the case as to who to trust in view of the testimony of Ford and Cavan, most of whom took Cavan's side.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in a certain or potentially ford testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in a certain or potentially cavern.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Cavana had probably or certainly lied during her testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flack, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations levelled by Ford as well as at least one other Fariadi, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him in a drunken stupor at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exhibited his genitals when he joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet as opposed to Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that wants to challenge Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Burners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access the information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Burners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring the resources, process and proper skills by the company so that Solid can make available to all.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to start the whole change, where all of their business models will end completely overnight."
"We are not asking permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Burners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vaughn: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Celebrated
The Church of England's only clergyman, who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I, celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the award in the September 29, 1918, attack on Belengalize and Lehocort.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at the parade held in Rashden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his sons, Michael Vaughn, said it was "excellently symbolic" that the poster was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn led his battalion "in the midst of a very dense fog, under heavy artillery and machine guns on the ground of war" at Canal de Saint-Quentin.
They later moved towards the firing line and, with "great bravery," led the military-line and smashed three pieces before taking the field-gun in hand alone.
Lt. Colonel Vaughn was killed by a German sniper just a month before the war ended on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's nicknames were "something I know he can never equal, but one we care about."
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughan also performed after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he is "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said "the support being given by a number of people is demonstrating the courage of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the all-nighter Belator 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 matches, including six on the main card and being shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Geghard Mausasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the U.K. were stunned by the turn of coverage into Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed after waking up in the morning for the match in particular.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Ballater's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, "This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulations, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Peppa the Pig, yes."
The company's president, Scott Cocker, said they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the replica, I think we'll probably find a solution to it," Koker said.
"But then there will be Sunday morning at six o'clock and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday."
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change took place, a lot of text was being moved and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that won’t happen next time.
We'll keep it limited to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more for the fans, it became something more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley felt 'innocence' in the case of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daily says he suffered from a slight feeling towards everyone because of his sexuality - but he got the inspiration to be successful with it.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he reached high school that "everyone isn't like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island disc, which was first presented by Lauren Lawrence, she said she talks about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a father, he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Cursti Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a socio-political figure in Laverne's first show, Daily said she felt "less" in herself than anyone because "likes of boys and girls were not socially acceptable."
“Even today, those feelings of feeling yourself less than others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he's also "special," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any trouble and she wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that a male - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - when he fell in love - "I was surprised."
Deli married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said that at such a young age, one of us passed through a period of similar experiences.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Deli said her "complete approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all have been 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's a lot more to the Olympics than gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
The last time he wanted to know if London 2012 tickets had come to him - because he wanted to sit in the front row - was that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that the last time he wanted to know was if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't stay to sit in the front row, Dad."
She said, "When they couldn't breathe, I held their hands and held them until their breath stopped and they were dead, so I went and thought they weren't invincible."
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd of natives at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his first favorite song - Proud By Heather Small - which was resonating with him during the preparation for the Olympics and which his rings still stand on hearing.
The Desert Island disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson out-of-form from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will set records on Sunday when he plays his 47th Riders' Cup match, but he will have to change his form to save it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial program for the 12th time for the record, Mikelson was kicked out of the game by captain Jim Furick for Saturday's Foreballs and Foresam.
Instead of becoming a center of attraction, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day working among cheerleaders and hoping to improve the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never directly driving even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was not the ideal fit for the tie-le-golf national course, where long-time inactives regularly get the punishment of wrong shots.
And where the course is not so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Michelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played alongside Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players, who start with four points down in 12 singles matches, make a strong start, then Michaelson's match can prove to be quite important.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that they could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and wrapped me in their arms and said they'd be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
She is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think I'd play two games.
I had imagined more, but it was the way it worked and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Michaelson will cross Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Rider Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a rider's cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Michaelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's witty, he's responsive, he likes to fly people's jokes, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Byron knows that a big lead could soon be lost.
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that a pretty big lead in last-day singles in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his first performance in the 1997 match at Valderama, where a side under Seav Ballestiros' captaincy had scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win, taking the lowest margin, had just reached the finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, we just got the win," said the 2018 class from 5-3 and yesterday after seeing the 10-6 lead in the Golf National, thinking the same.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it's not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus has to be maintained.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world are on the other side."
Byron went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: "I'll never be able to get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow will be a personal show, and that's a different thing.
It’s great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you personally get out there, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to show off your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he also has to give his best performance."
Unlike Byron, the opposing standing Jim Fury would have been aiming for a better performance personally for his players which he had done as a partner, except for Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who had scored three of the four points.
Before facing defeat due to Europe's "miracle in the Medina" showdown, as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Fury himself has been on both ends of those big final days' repetitions."
"I remember every moment of it," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Cranshaw had handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches yesterday, but you'd like to start as fast as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina.
When this speed is unilateral, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our line-up on our own and involved people like this, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack with Rory McClero in the top match, where Paul C.C., Justin Rose, John Reham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had them grouped in this order because I think it covers all of them," Byron said of his single selections.
Germany's new warship has been put on hold again.
New German Navy warships should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-impacted Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of the "Reinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the all-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the issues that plagued the post-delivery impacted the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought in as replacements for time-impacted Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will provide a range of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared and sonic division facilities.
Other important features include long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships for up to two years from indigenous ports.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warship – which could give Germany a chance to power a project abroad – will be delayed until the period of entry into service, Die Zein commented.
The unfortunate F125 warship was a bummer last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned Blohm and Wass Shipyard to Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited many important "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The software's shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically more weighted which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Reinland-Pfalz" is considered twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the value tag of the entire project - which also includes training of the crew - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have gone from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships that have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings is crippling Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy is actually "defeating the deployment-capable ships."
The issue has become serious over time, as the old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available, the official said.
None of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships were able to join the navy, he said.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
The aim of the new research being done at an estate in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland, will be followed by the Dobdenum Chandeliers, which are common and soprano pipelines, as well as brown-colored long-eared and in the Inverway Garden in Weston Ross.
Special records will be set at the major places around the estate to track the activities of the batsmen throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recording shows the frequency of the bat call and what species are doing.
A map and report of the natural habitat will then be prepared for depiction on a detailed landscape-map of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-housing management activities such as grassland construction and how to properly maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
There has been a significant decline in the population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK in the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the nests of birds and harm the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and construction materials, as well as attacks by pets, can also become dangerous.
The lighthouses are not really blind.
However, when it comes to catching prey due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to point out faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect the nests of birds and sometimes save them.
The organisation has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Dumfries and Three Estates in Galway, Scotland, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for him.
"We have a good area for bats here in Tripod," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there's a lot about the lizard that's still unknown, so what we do here and in other assets will help us understand what they need to survive."
They stress the importance of scavenging the bats before keeping them inside the properties as it is possible that 400 women and babies could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity ward inadvertently, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to know about our bats and we still don't know how their population is growing about many of our species," he said.
Ronaldo dismissed the rape claims, while lawyers filed a lawsuit in a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called claims of rape against him "false news" saying people want to "promote the self" by using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus Forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Dere Spegel said in the report on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in Instagram live video after the claims were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer, Der Spiegel, is preparing to prosecute those charges, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Shertz said the players would seek compensation for moral harm in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
It is said that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Meyorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Meyorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he is "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but there was mutual consent for this.
Meyorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had also taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "appalled by the suggestion" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to terminate the agreement as his harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer, the Italian giant negotiated a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Juve.
BREXIT: U.K. 'will have regrets forever' to lose maker
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. would have "forever regrets" if it loses its rank as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the case of no-deal Brexit, the border delay could have an impact on jobs.
The Burnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Ori and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnstone.
Other U.K. carmakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreeing to how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns relate to the risk of supply chain in the event of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts for Made-to-Order cars arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the U.K. and the European Union.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, according to industry, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's chequers scheme for future relations with the European Union "has been calibrated to avoid those checks purely at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I think can not only be enjoyed at the moment, but also that is essential to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have found evidence that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, warned that the additional cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually leave jobs.
Peter Sawallarys, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is a United Union convener at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: “Once in my experience when these jobs will go away, they never come back to the bait.
"We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union," a government spokesman said.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-stakes meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, could stall for "one more week" as Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh's fight continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between the Trump aide and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and putting Mueller's freedom in jeopardy, the news has heated Washington's rumored market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiretap and removal of the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday they went to the White House amid this news, that they are going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "like" to remove Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Cavana and the woman who accused her of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blessie Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI probe into Kavanaugh's claims, delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date has not been set for this, it could be this week, I can see that the issues of all other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed forward another week.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a disinterest in the "presence" of TV reporters, though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are great."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
She said, "The presidents do more questioning sessions than any other president," citing the evidence, she said, "We've seen those numbers."
The briefing will still be, Sanders said, but "if the press gets a chance to ask a direct question from the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We do a lot of trying to do that and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States, he's going to take the place of the press conference."
When leaving the White House or attending open sessions or with dignitaries, Trump regularly answers questions at a press conference.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated, perhaps several times, why the presence of Baak and the unique presence in front of the journalists present.
Health Secretary NHS Scotland writes to EU workers about Brexit's fears in the wake of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Gene Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of applications for settlement status for EU citizens working in its impoverished public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the U.K. and the European Union continue to hold mutual talks, moving towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the U.K. government is also moving ahead with its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and beyond, brings with it valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after being hit in the head
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who faced a 31-27 loss from the Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery following a head injury, said Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred just a short time before the half-time.
"He came to the edge and just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on the stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aberdromby had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details are yet available on the type/limit of injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a redshirt sophomore, is in her first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he made a total of five tackles on Saturday, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be taken from foreign buyers when buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged a high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new tori schemes.
This move will nullify the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the U.K.
Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year to help homeless people
High stamp duty rates are being prepared on purchases of property from foreign buyers in the U.K. – the extra cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to nullify the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
Stamp duty hikes will be imposed on non-taxpayers and firms in the UK, which will boost the government's campaign to deal with gold miners in dire circumstances with additional funds.
Excess - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two houses started two years ago and buyers to rent, may be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country is high.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of bouncing the land but not using it to raise property prices, and urged them to leave quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain’s “housing mess” from the message.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including an end to rent control and "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more powers to councils to build new houses.
"Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation," she said.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market. . . .
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-residents in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy a home for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of home ownership has come a long way, and the rage of gold in exceptional circumstances is extremely real."
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sanderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the League One, and which is three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer of this year after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's just it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampton with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back."
This opportunity will only come when I am successful in club management.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keynes, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel any fright in following such established names at such a large club, which had previously rejected the Barnesle and Ipswich Town initiative.
"At the moment, I can predict success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League."
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
"It's no easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful here if I can get the club there."
As Dumberton's assistant boss and after spending 15 months in Harts coaching staff, Ross's management career has lasted just three years.
He then helped Aloa recover from the decline of the third tier, and replaced St. Mirren with the decline of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they now feel more comfortable than work done during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academics.
In the matter of taking charge of Aloa, he said, "It was probably the real cross."
"I really believed that management was more perfect for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, earned the right amount of money from it, and enjoyed some decent heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I’m doing this, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, found in the survey.
The summer tapas has boosted Britain’s struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July — but restaurant ups and downs were 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: "Continuous sunshine and July compared to the expected participation in the World Cup of England means that in the month of last June the same pattern was followed, even when the tide was 2.8 per cent, even when the tide was up.
The decline in restaurant trade of 1.8 per cent in June further worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling liquor performed the strongest with more preference than restaurants.
Food-driven pubs also had to suffer damage in the sun, though not dramatically like restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, vacation and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sports events becomes the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, though a 4.8 percent year-over-year decline in sales, particularly due to ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been a time and a bad time for food and material operators and only time will tell whether the higher average temperatures we have experienced in August will provide much-needed relief.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slow pace in brand roll-out.
The Coffre Pitch Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups that perform sales monitoring of the industry with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and it is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that “fake insta” accounts grew rapidly – a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean "key" account to show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenage girl in it was urging others to "rape me."
Research by the Digital Agence UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which were accepted for keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s a very disturbing thing that a lot of teenagers are drawn to making a place online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elidh Doyle to have 'Voice for Athletes' on Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are leading the game to take advantage of his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"The elite have a lot of respect for the Scottish, U.K. and World Athletics community in their minds and we are confident that bringing them to the board in Scotland will bring a lot of benefit," she said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as a voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the Americans, who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now who are regular BBC pundits, were unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I felt an injury.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I will be okay or not and to what extent I can be right.
It was a terrible job, but to fully recover, to walk again and learn to practice agility today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Compared to mothers' cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of people online
A breast pump company shared an online opinion by an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers by doubling cow's milk.
To mark the launch of a product called the "World's First Silent Wearable Breast Pump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funky music video-driven ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance to a song in the grassy meadow of cows that includes some kind of saying: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't thumps, these are my breasts."
The course continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Dam Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused the online dispute.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it presents the dairy industry's "horror" in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
Just like us, they need to give birth to get pregnant and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them in the lunar days after they are born," one wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother) Gets Sensibly Fitted Inside
Another comment: "Obviously sad for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them for breast pump advertising for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant advertisement."
Others defended the ad, one of whom said she found the ad's song "funny."
"I think that's a very good idea.
I would have had this if I was still breastfeeding.
From pumping I have absolutely the experience of being a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that it's a great product."
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience it like a ‘cat’.”
This is not a promotion or a decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they continued to pump carefully into their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elve pump remains well hidden, it has no wire or tube and fits directly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to walk without pumping, catch their children and even go outside.
Anna Ballerin, Partner and Mother in the ECD commented: "The Elve pump is a revolutionary product, worthy of a blasting and fantastic launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and relevant way, which will bring a new pump.
This is not the first time the Elve pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Marta Jacobosky, appeared to be catwalking.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The intercepted migrant children were being spyed on, even when there was no relative change in monthly border crossing, to some extent because the harsh curtsy and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to appoint children with sponsors.
Traditionally, maximum sponsors had appointed undocumented migrants themselves and were afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to live in the country by going ahead and claiming on any child.
The threat increased even more in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adults or large members of the household would have to hand over their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with non-immigrant officials.
Last week, a senior official of Matthew Albens, Immigration and Customs Enforcement presented evidence before the Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the people arrested do not already have a criminal record.
"About 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are living illegally in the country and the maximum of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
Demanding the early preparation of the children, the authorities introduced new rules according to which children were required to appear in court within a month of being apprehended instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the employees who took refuge.
Many people appear through video conference calls instead of appearing in person to present their case for legal status before a non-immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately expelled.
The longer children remain incarcerated, the more likely they are to remain in their backlog or depression, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to the defense staff and the system’s report in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility such as Turnillo, where signs that the child is struggling are ignored due to their size.
At the same time, he said that taking children to tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on military forces occupying the United States, France and Turkey to return immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moolem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the war in the country was now the eighth year.
Maulam, who also works as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must immediately and unconditionally return from the war land," he told the assembly.
Maulam stressed that the war in Syria is "almost over" where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several lakhs were torn from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this "alien war until we clear all Syrian areas of both terrorist groups and the presence of a 'foreigner'."
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in a country devastated by war.
In the case of the refugees, Maulam said that the circumstances for their return were fine and he blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading the fear of poverty,” which motivated the refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They were politicizing a completely humane case."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive any assistance for reconstruction unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. politicians say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib's last major rebellion creates an opportunity to push ahead with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people lived.
However, Maulam said the agreement has a "clear timeline" and also expressed hope that the military action would target fighters including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who "will be thrown out."
The representative of the United States, Mr. Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with the government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the election path soon.
Maulam placed some conditions on the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, stating that the work of the panel should be banned to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why Trump will win in the second term
With that argument, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberals or nobles are expecting any culpability and fraud to end their tenure ahead of time.
"This will be the most dramatic end of the national post so far!"
So far, no fatigue has been seen in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of more than 1.7 million prime-time viewers in the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" found the highest position in cable ratings with major news broadcasts at night, with 3.5 million viewers.
Neil Bayer, the director of an ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary "Disidentified Survivor" who becomes president after being destroyed at an American Parliament building in an attack, said "it's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something that we don't understand."
Neil Scovel, an experienced comedy writer and producer of "Just the Funny Parts: And the Hollywood Boys" is a different theory of some of the harsh truths hidden in the "club."

"She said, 'Because she's laughing at me,'" Ms. Scowell told me.
There was the value of entertainment in the disorder.
Indeed, on TV and beyond, stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unity of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only qualified spectators could have taken the risk of hearing it out.
And yet, it’s beyond being a conscious citizen, when you find yourself looking at a six-hour debate by a panel of experts, called Woodward “Deep Background” for his book “Fire,” using the original cause of Paul Manafort’s $15,000 Bomber Jacket (“Harry’s One”).
I will never see Super Mario like that again.
Brent Montgomery, creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars," said, "He's a part of whatever he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night."

When I went to meet Mr. Flees this week, there was a hot 80 degree temperature outside his house on the eastern edge of Kaui, but he was watching MSNBC recording CNN inside the house.
He couldn't take himself away from it when Brat Cavenno was ready to face the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the Senate Judiciary Committee and Taruzu.
"I remember when we were doing all those silly or excited shows in those days and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleisch told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but later found out they were right."

The race of the Electoral House led to a flood of external money in a strong middle-class
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania in the 17th century was hit by a flood of money or cash, the credit of which went to the reconstruction of the Congress party, due to which two officials appeared for the same seat race.
Who recently opened the front for the Democratic Rep Conner Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district – who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
Lampe was also involved in a second-place race, the Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which intertwines with the new 17th.
In January, following this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the case of unconstitutional forgery by the old districts in favor of the Republican, maps or maps were recreated.
The empty-handed battle between the major finance arms in the new 17th round, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) had touched the campaign's economy.
After a narrow victory widely seen in the March special election in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania, Lamb's name became quite popular in Pennsylvania.
That's why the Republican held that seat for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. punishes Al-Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
The diplomats mentioned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of Washington's resistance.
Mr. Trump had a scathing meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team expelled the partners.
Earlier this month, the department's spokesman Haider Norte said in a statement that on the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore" the officials of the political department decided to recall the US heads of the diplomatic mission from Al Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only Al Salvador was fined, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic aid.
The proposed fine, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity, to follow the same as last year, which sought to prevent migrants from moving forward from the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end while considering any penalties or penalties for Al Salvador.
Politicians said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative places at the conference.
And three American returned from Washington without any harsh message or penalty to Al Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or dispute described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an outside analyst, who is close to the administration as well as speaks on the condition of not clarifying the name.
The history of study
The next case may be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on possible resistance to Mr. Trump's trial, of which there is now sufficient evidence on public record.
At the same time, according to the Mr. Mueller report, the direction of their investigation changes if Mr. Trump’s campaign comes in contact with Russia to attack our elections.
When the Congress gets its hands on it, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body, when they prepare themselves to go before the voters again and perhaps in front of a crowd of their colleagues.
That is to say, if or if and I do not mean to indicate or suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and Czechoslovakia supported him in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the massacre for so many years.
The functioning of the historical centre points around such points of division is accelerated or delayed on the frivolous march of democracy.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump’s Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, removes him from the job, what would we do?
Rosenstein has been in this mess ever since this paper reported it last year, he suggested secretly keeping the president’s record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosentin said that the account of The Times is not accurate.
"If the F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavangoh, recently requested, is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite the verifiable allegations of sexual exploitation and false testimony, how will we react?"
And above all, will we vote for the Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will remain for the long winter.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I've learned in Preg.

Graham Doran's Rangers are optimistic even after intense Viena encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Wiena on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, winning over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevented Midfielder Graham from appearing for the first time in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because the Villarreal were good," the 31-year-old said.
"We move forward in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it's a second big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with our back crowd or crowd in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself were certainly difficult last year but now I have a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the guys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully now we can move forward and succeed by leaving our previous session behind."
Women are losing sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holi Sinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare to take care of your family if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counselor and your family about where and how to get care, as they can be important factors in determining the cost of the option.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you tips on how to pay for those expenses.
A traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-valuable life insurance policy, can be included, as long as you have access to it, to help pay for these expenses in your disposal options for long-term care or to insure your own health.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the right of attorney for inspection of your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and they are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Write down the information in the plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just a financial role, but who's the doctor?" Martin asked.
"What kind of drugs are given?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Is there a plan?"
A man shot several times in the air in Lafrakob
A man was shot several times by an air rifle while he was going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Devon's Oxford Grove area when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of the BST at about 02:30 am as a "random incident."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not so deep so the police appealed to him to be a witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Upon communication being off, rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern region of Palu which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were trapped in the rubble.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shores of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency on the beach in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The population estimated at 299 in regency below the administrative province, was 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of the river.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Moravia on the opposite coasts of the maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, the tsunami in Palu and Dongala has hit several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were reported to have been killed and hundreds of homes were destroyed due to the tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck in the West Bank, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and regularly suffers from an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck 14 countries on the western coast of Indonesia's Ek Province in North Sumatra on December 26, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in Ak.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.

Sarah Pelin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Pelin, the ruler of eastern Alaska and vice presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assaulting Sarah Pelin's eldest son.
Wasila, an Alaskan, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday, for tampering with a report of domestic violence and protesting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report a alleged crime, she would take the phone from him.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Maut-Su Primary facility and also fined an unsecured bond of $500.
The network's report said he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" on being asked for the plea.
Pelin faced three A-class criminals, where he could be fined up to a year and $250,000.
He is also charged under Class B offence with a one-day jail sentence and $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pelin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Experienced Persons of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with obstructing the report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had punched her in the face.
After her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Pelin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, as well as rising mortality rates, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, which is the northeastern region of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact on social media were circulating.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered for the festival in the middle of the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspect in the NYC attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the rare death penalty for Safulo Sypov, a suspect in a terror attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare penalty given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, allegedly uses a home depot rental truck to attack by bike on the westbound highway in Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the information of the intention to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sipov has "knowingly" killed eight victims and "knowingly" physically injured them."
Both countries potentially give the death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Sipoo to death for 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder for aiding in racketeering, which were specifically framed in organized crime cases and prosecuted in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said there was a need for "sufficient planning and prior consideration" for the attack, explaining the way in which Sypov carried it out in a "humble, cruel and evil" manner.
"Saifulu Habibulavik Sypov has Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleave Anlor Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Elojandro Mitrikon."
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The trial of the last death penalty case in the South District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Brain was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death for the last time in the New York federal case, a married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Zo<0xC3><0xAB> Rosenberg was sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Sypov did not have any glans or remorse for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
The police said they told the investigators that they liked everything they did.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos while meeting with the crime on his phone.
The police said they also requested to display the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
He requested not to be himself convicted for the offence of 22-counting.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sypov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel that our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released will only delay the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Sypov's defence team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Faraz should be made in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to 'gather an army of people' during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern European leader asked politicians to 'understand the mood' from Euroskeptics - because Theresa May's own MP suggested they should negotiate with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that if Mr Faraz were Brexit secretary, Britain would have been "outdone" by now.
But the challenges faced by Mrs. May in resolving her extremely divided rank have been underscored by Pro-Remain Tory to add a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep track of his chequer's compromise plan during attacks from Brexiteers, reindeer and the European Union.
The allies urged that he would try to make any deal with Brussels instead of backlash – and force Euroskeptics and workers to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that quitting means quitting the rally in Solihal, in which he wants to 'throw the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and that he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
"""I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out,"" the Wellington MP or MP said."
Setting up its opposition in the European Union, he said: "We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war."
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bon rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay is totally false."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkin was also quoted in March as saying: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister Ji, listen to the people.
The checker is not popular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our workers who actually encircle the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Smt., he said: Prime Ministers maintain their jobs when they do not break their promises.
Mr Faraz said that the leaders of the rally should be made 'feelings' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter between our people and our political classes," he said.
"They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we have come here to tell them that 'we will not let you run away by doing that.'
Sending a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of deceiving Brexit by understanding the environment.
"We are organizing the army of the people of this country who have won us in Brexit and who do not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remnants march from Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists pointed out the tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to negotiate for security issues arising from the party app upon the opening of the Lord Adonis Conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the right IT system and all the technology for Canada, the borderless and free trade without borders in Ireland.
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Waran plans to adopt a 'hard view' on the President's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that during the town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday, the Massachusetts Republican or Democrat spoke about his future.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren GOP is in the race for re-election in the state's prestigious Joff Dahl in November, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were being speculated that they could take Trump's place in 2020.

One of the people present asked if he was going to join the President's race.
Warren responded that now is the time to "go and fix our broken-foot government and include women first."
LSU Sim's death was attributed to
In Betton Disease, LA, police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Bethon Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.

Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton ends the world title after the team's victory over Sebastian Wettle
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas was eligible to play a major role in the Lewis Hamilton Mercedes team order race on Saturday.
From Paul, Bottas made a good start and knocked Hamilton out as he made his place in the first two corners and invited Vettel to create obstacles in his team's drivers.
Wetal first went to Pitts and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes was a lap behind and came out from behind the Wettle but Hamilton stepped forward after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver leave without any risk after a double-movement while reluctantly defending on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in tenth place when he reached the end of the lap before his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a large part of the race when he focused his focus on changing his tyres in it and moved faster than km Raconnen in fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, when Reconnaissance took fourth place.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a very good job all weekend and is a really good gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job by getting one or two," Hamilton said.
It was, in fact, a very bad feeling.
President Donald Trump lied to Senator Din Feinstein at his request on Saturday, failing to leak that letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which he had accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavangua of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the Senate's current situation, he said that people are "meaningful and mean and bad and dishonest."
"There's a very good thing or thing that can happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you see the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Finstein, did you leak it?
His answer remembers... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?"
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
“We didn’t, we didn’t, we didn’t,” he said, pointing to the senator.
Finstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations levelled against Kavangua by Ford back in July and it was leaked in early September - but Finstein denied that it was leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak his story," Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I have kept it confidential as he says."
But the president didn't feel justified in his rejection, who commented in Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you this was really a very bad mood.
Maybe he didn't, but I've rarely seen such bad moods before."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said the Democrats were using the allegations on their own behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power by any necessary means.
You see their meaning, their filth, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the arbitrator reported the President's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Daver scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars on Saturday won the return match of 5-3 in Dundee, compensating for the loss of the elite league against the Belfast Giants on Friday.
The Giant initially got a two-goal lead through attacks from Patrick Doer and Francis Buwillier.
Before the Giants lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowne Dyer took home the home side level before re-establishing.
Before securing a two-goal win by Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen, Francos Boschard equalised it for Dundee.
This was the third elite defeat of the season for Adam Keyfe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With Giant winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
Door's opener came in at 3:35 with the help of Candace McFaul, in which David Rutherford helped Buwillier double the lead in the next four minutes.
In the busy initial period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before coming up on the Queen's equal at 15:16 of the matt square.
Dore makes sure that the Giants advance in the first break until they score their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The domestic side is grouped again and the bossard once again takes them to the level period with the power play goal at 27:37.
The Queen and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nelson lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured victory only in the fifth half of his team's final period.
Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now set to play their home ground at Milton Kane in their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or hero, ever since he was killed to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could be safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Aftershocks in the area continued to devastate and many people were trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But when his associates were running to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his busy-controlled post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufrey Airport in Palu.
He was there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtret, said the decision could have saved the lives of hundreds of people, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from the crowd in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them even before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when he left," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll from the country's destruction could reach thousands, the minimization agency says access to the dongala, sigi and botonesh is limited.
"The death rate may still rise because many bodies may still be buried in debris, or in many places where it cannot be reached," said Sutopo Nughroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six meters high devastated Palu, due to which a mass burial was carried out on Sunday.
The Army and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Reisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance came with the bodies.
It is rare to find clean water.
Smaller markets were looted all over the place.
Jain Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running to help the Red Cross animals, but we don't know what they will get there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation or evacuation of all of you.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year in Indonesia, there was a landslide in Lobong, in which about 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports that a man has been missing since the plane crash
The airline, which operates the crashed plane in Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia, now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew had been safely removed from the plane by plunging.
Air Niyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not detect a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to trace the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for over-information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
While trying to land at the missing island airport when the plane went into the water, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the crash and how it happened.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jen said the plane had come down a lot.
Jen said, "It's a very good thing."
Jane said she and others were taken out of the deep water from the emergency exit on the plane by drowning.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working around to improve the ghat also helped rescue people by using a windy boat to bring them to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the aviation security network indicates that 111 people have been killed in the PNG-registered airline crash in the last two decades but none were involved in the airstrike.
The analyst told the time of night, when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday restored its case to re-trial a man on charges of inciting a Mississippi woman to burn to death in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rolet presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used a cell phone record to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rollett said she obtained location data from several cellphones, which shows that her previous claims were with the Talis Chambers on the night she died, The Clarion-Lazer reported.
When the data shows that when she said she was with her friend Michelle Sanford, at the time her cell phone was with Chambers, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented his speech and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Talleys was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rollett said that shortly after Chamber's death, Talys has removed all text or message, call or contact information from his phone.
"He said, ""He took her out of his life."
Defendants are ready to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to go to the jury to hear the trial on that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative view of style by filling in positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has fallen short of its roots in dealing with political messages and social issues.

Artists such as Fugees and Common saw a recent resurgence in Britain through artists such as Alaka and Loki.
The second black man?
NY nanny sues couple after firing after 'racist' text, says she's been arrested
When a New York nanny complains by a mother that she's the "second black person," she sues a couple for partisan shooting after misleading text.
Couples deny that they are resisting, prosecuting for "appropriation."
Lincy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, discovers that the new baby-sitter Giselle Maurice expresses her backstory, which was black on her first workday in 2016.
"No other black person," Ms. Plasco Flexman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing her mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that her outgoing Nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been a philanthropist instead.
Mrs. Morris was sent home to Uber by paying for her one-day work.
Now, the Morris couple is seeking a job withdrawal and $350 per day compensation for six months, in a live-in gig she was appointed to begin work though without any contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do any such work," he said, explaining that "I know it's discrimination," he said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on the claims that they are racists, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was justified to terminate Maurice's employment.
"My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," the husband told the Post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it was by mistake?
"Your new baby?
Leave as well."
Like the “approach” lawsuit, Plasco said his wife has only had a baby for two months and she is in a “very difficult situation.”
"You're going after someone like that?"
It's not right to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still going on, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning has given an immediate response to the couple's accusation on social media.
Padiston publishers fear that the reader will not associate it with their own thoughts and opinions, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone in their own place before it's published for the first time.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Talking about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by the toy of a small bear, he was optimistic about his rejection of his work, he said that both were "happy and happy" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family," she says her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and was not at all proud," she said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost as if you had a kid who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not really doing it."
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his imagination and composition, yet he always credited Paddington with it.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was useless.
"Naed was regularly saying that it was really bad, there was no such expectation of it," said Mrs. Adnen-Lapurus.
"Then Nad called me and told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors had given her to beat her heart was slowly ending up leaving her system.
He had died some time ago and it was all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family members.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lapurus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and cried all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see the feeling of extreme sympathy for Nad on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of Women Victims to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to stop others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on Welsh's bridge with inspirational messages, on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a bona fide chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could shine everywhere.
However, he left work before he died and he lived in a "very dark room."
In 2014, Tyler's brother who was searching for his lost brother or sister at the age of 11, after which he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect."
Ms. Davis created the card, "to tell people that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they're not friends."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis's for years, lost her friend Mark, aged 15, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was sad or upset or feeling anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their doors, he could not see them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but she had to get out of it: "It kept the family torn from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to move forward."

At the start of the FBI investigation, Kavanaugh's future was hanging in the balance.
"I thought, if I can actually find something that she's looking for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we'll get a little unity," Mr Fleck said on Saturday, as well as fearing that the committee was "breaking up" between the alleged biased gridlock.
Why did Mr. Cavangua and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of his lack of time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so those who wanted to win in the High Court on land, they will be severely weakened in their efforts.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, campaigning for Mr. Kuvangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuvangua can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which was to be confirmed by Mike Pence, the Vice President, by terminating it and in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Kim 'failed'
North Korea went to South Korea to reduce the number of fugitives seven years ago when John-on came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's Ministry of Integration, Park Beyong-Siyogo said 1,127 people had fled their duties last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and smugglers were the main factors.
Pyeongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of refugees from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum China fled, whose border is the longest with North Korea and it is easy to cross the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by forcing them to do so.
The relationship between North and South - which is still technically at war - has seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on the blockaded nuclear talks.
It took effect in June after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed on the terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yang-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no other way than to harm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Roy said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelori called Bret Cavangua "fun" and said she was not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavangua "fun" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think of any Mahila doing such a performance either, they call it 'fun'," Pelosi said on Thursday, responding to Cavangua's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavangua emotionally denied the allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blesi Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her initial statement, Kavangua was very emotional, sometimes stopping screaming and breathing while talking about her family and her school years.
He clearly punished the Democrat on the committee by liberals by proving him a liar on charges of "strange and coordinated character assassination," angered by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said he feels that the witnesses of Kavangua have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as this shows that he is acting against the Democrat.
"I think he disapproved of himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrat," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt that if it is asked if Kavangua becomes permanent and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, would he still blame Kavangua?
"I'd say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but he can work right now because he's invited," Pelosi said.
Kavangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavangua's potential rules against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe Weed Act, as they are known to do conservative justice.
In the wake of his certification, Kavangua averted questions as to whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"In hearing his confirmation, Kavangua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious objection, the anger of months and years goes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Mrs. Stamin told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She kept saying, "A woman helped me a lot who works somewhere an officer, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, 'I can cry because I can't.'
I'm angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was very good."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An initial job, one of the sharpest memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from behind - a sharp manager I was always a little scared of - who threw me into the stairs.
He said, "Don't cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them. "
Patricia Shroder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat or in a name other than marriage and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Shroder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to participate in the race of the President himself.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called her "Snow White and Eat Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was delayed, he did not have time to raise funds and so he swore that he would not participate in the race until he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 would only give him $250.
“Do they think I’ve got a discount?” she wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he would not launch any formal campaign, he could not control the emotions - thanks to those who accompanied him, disappointment with the system due to which he found it difficult to raise funds and even resentment towards those targeted voters rather than the representatives.
"You would have thought I'd have a nervous break down," Ms. Shroder recalled how the press would have reacted about them.
"You must have thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they're going to put on my face?
"Did he cry?"
How U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
Trade between the U.S. and China was going to slow down the initial salvo of the war and while the war is still far from over, the split between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week, with new tariffs affecting items worth up to $200 billion (150 billion pounds), is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods brought from China to the U.S.
Beijing has resisted in its own way every time, most recently slapping tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods ranging from five to 10 percent.
China has promised to match the US with a shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to be bullish soon.
Getting back to Washington means digging up the demands, but publicly bowing your head in front of the US would be very embarrassing for the President of China, Zee Jinping.
Still, experts say that Beijing can move its course, while the US trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that either initiate economic tell-tale in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what audiences have seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on New America’s security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moulam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and safe because of the progress made today against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate in the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore the normal situation.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe wins the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup by defeating the U.S. team at the final score gate from 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now faced defeat on European soil six times in a row and has not won a Rider's Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jorn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to beat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the 3rd 16th hole by accepting the match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 so far since the current format of the tournament was launched in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was defeated 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjon Olsson, the lowest-ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Lan Polter of England, who had probably played his last Rider's Cup.
An experienced, Spaniard of the eight-rider cup, Sergio Garcia has become the European winner every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m very happy that I was able to help,” Greece said emotionally after Europe’s win.
He slammed his partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
Rahm, 23, said: "I am extremely proud to beat Tiger Woods, I have grown up watching them."
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career rider cup record.
One of the greatest players to date has won 14 major titles in second place after only Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finney, who played golf with full caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furc said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congrats to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and Riders Cup Committee of the United States and move forward with Thomas.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
You should congratulate them.
We played better."
