A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and remove citizens with a judicial record their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000; 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65; and 20 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their ID card with a photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
But it turns out that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same goes for Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men even more reluctant to pass screening tests?
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European study, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that we have between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if we are not screened.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
The criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are increasingly being determined with precision.
I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if we should go through it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many of them are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This greatly harms people’s health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The Weight
Obesity and overweight also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
“Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” it added.
The food
The organization also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Butchers also, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it said.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Getting a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it's not entirely certain that it's the Higgs yet.
It is known without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still missing to be perfectly sure.
Let's assume it's Higgs anyway, since the chances of getting it wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Now even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other are stirring bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "particle of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it should be noted here, are not all as exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field at this precise location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (of light, or of infrared, or of ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with this difference being that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometer ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what "can bring" all this research, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SMS), and it also allows physicists to examine any gap between observations and predictions of the SMS.
There are many who would like to find it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Note: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was going to trigger.
They envisioned scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle – who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that at first the laser was rather seen as a “lab gadget”.
I imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention at all, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this essential area.
Duty tried to take a closer look.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that gnawed him had left him a two-year hiatus.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, half-fig half-grain, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s still a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attached to an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who do business around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that I’m cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"In our life, we learn that a man pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses" that surrounds them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and suffocated”.
But the illness made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have wishes in life anymore,” she says, before agreeing to wear a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the next few days, for one last visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, we provide, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
It is palliative care that is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
At the time of death, we will accept to provide oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died the night before.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well tucked into his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that scares several physicians specialized in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists cling to their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard's hopes of survival were already low when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet, she told me that I was finished!
No almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which involves sleeping the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us day after day what they know about a formidable “system”, mixing building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system has been crumbling since the big money was taken,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into malpractices related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to backtrack.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” some refuting their instincts to reach a quota share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of "L'escuade Marteau" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel des éguts" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
He is suspected of pocketing repeat bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers on the road in Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of the Montreal contracts to a mafia-linked middleman who paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay’s party.
Mr. Zambito planted the wind in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts for which it inflates the costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption was functioning smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it well in front of the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pots of wine totaling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for contracts of sewers whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have admitted to having their paw greased by inflating 30% to 40% of the bills, by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected officials in Montreal to pull the alarm bell.
Mayor of the borough of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased 5 million dollars and resold ... 1.6 million to promoters, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "pulls on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a separate Montreal investigation unit and a night watch to keep the questionable practices from coming back.
It's like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "electors aware of the scheme", when they did not soak in the mage!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the outcome, he said: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at it in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I step on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a match, it's easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine Preformation Centre to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won many titles with big clubs.
He has played with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our hen, in front of Porto, to be able to receive during the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot of us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find things to blame, it's sure to be a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more of.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team builds over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can answer present.
Look at Manchester City who haven’t qualified for the 8th final in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
Looking at the sums invested, you were pictured 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s achievements.
The better it is said that there is a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he sets a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves he's the star of League One.
He proved everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things out there and I came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what has happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first few months at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) snatched, on October 16, in Spain, is it a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite is true of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files peer to peer.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around $10 (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and processes exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are at once custodians of the ledger of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist well in the public ledger, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched at computers, and whose winner, sort of a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and unique fingerprint.
Computers “take” the new transaction and add a number to it before they “hash” the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular impression (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves room for further expansion.
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weighty actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a textbook on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement at merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left from Afghanistan.
And then what?
The French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, such as the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, flown over by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban insurgency in Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the organization of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join forces in a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, seizing government lands to resell them to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They have deconsecrated themselves; most of them have not fought for themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumour has been spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to take it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's most important employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest agriculture and rezinibilit.
This work, local labourers, was able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, a small, well-controlled, civilian aid should be maintained in their favour that touches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given this Assembly two more months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "treach his word" and "walk the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to abandon their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy, as the protests rage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he said in an interview with American weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote is due to the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these must supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, largely Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, believing that they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 substitute members were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Some commentators were amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, with some members of the committee believing that the constituent's pendulum was wrongly set.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, Article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the principal source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," replied the Liberals, who saw it only as a communication blow.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trials of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, be prohibited.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially in the press.
In addition, there is no longer any article that speaks to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has selected five major reasons to visit Israel.
Go Worship the Holy Places
Unmissable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptismal grounds" will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where fishing was miraculous.
It is at this precise place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Stone of the Annunciation and the tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, a symbol of humanity’s salvation.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress of Massada, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
To the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all in one stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moldings of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are scintillating.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned in it.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each one offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21° while that of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim in it all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure water contains brine and very easily retains the bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of a surreal beauty.
We come here to carry out a treatment based on salt water, lemon, curative mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here himself a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk in the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to Tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish, and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, balls of chickpeas, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk in the high air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars in the evening.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be eaten.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
On average, a visit to the museum costs 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists went to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, goes to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists debate what the mandatory language test law will do, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the History of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or degrees of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Russian-language Pushkin Institute, the University of Peoples' Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, according to the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At their house, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are cheated, they are taken away from their passport, and they do not get the expected salary,” says Tolib Charipov, head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia trust that they not only do not know the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a suitable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start making money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work afterwards.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajikistani, told reporters.
“Hurry up, don’t skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the language law's entry into force, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for granted: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper bits”.
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time examination time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the bearers of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out during marriages or the murder organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining a gun license by increasing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil arms laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing to the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to the officer
The black market for weapons is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is the "military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were deliberately started to conceal the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with the competition in the international market and flow weapons into the black market, especially in Moscow,” said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organizes the supply,” adds the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Studies.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal files and public data of the portals related to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by the fault of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine sheets".
An armory salesman and consultant who asked to remain anonymous says that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, for example a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per unit with two loaders," he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers,” the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy shows up and proposes to come to the Begovaya train station where someone had to take me to a "corner" to shop.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I believed in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I am not content to buy, we go with the seller into the forest and we install a target.
“I get shot and when I’m convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"Just have a precise amount of money," it says in advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun."
The users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buys TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of fake sites and is picking up people who want to buy weapons of war.
People flock to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia.
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard of this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a vast network of fake sites and is picking up people who want to buy weapons of war.
“People are flocking to food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia,” he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes overall decreased by 7% in Russia and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go on a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take on scale or blow out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the modest wage increases that base employees receive at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the protests want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, on “Black Friday,” at a time when a torrential rain of sales taking over millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggered scalars.
That day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize pickets of strike with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products there are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply, especially because of the low salaries of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who hits $9.5 an hour, that’s an amount he can’t afford.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer the entire salary increase onto consumers’ shoulders, every race in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They will spend $12.39 more in just one year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any harm to the group.
“Black Friday” continued in stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items a second over that period.
Its cashiers made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was just "an operation of com' among so many others" by the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
Protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but little, on average, its basic employees reach $ 8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody touches less than them in this town.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that amount in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain about having to live on that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with bribes or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near Times Square’s McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s announces to sell billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work!”
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said "we all need to support fast-food workers so they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not counting that not all were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult at the moment to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
“For the moment, we can only fool the brain on average.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceive augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model at its annual conference this summer, and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already from ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment at the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the control by the gesture.
What does the future hold for us, too?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, not really.
We’re trying to change that, and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
It is necessary to bring out the computer world in our physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's appreciated, but isn't it overrated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of one's actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to tell.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
Are they lacking resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, gave the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames to the second.
Should we not increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular field-of-view sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands up is not convenient but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortals.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don’t feel anything.
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There’s one more task below that will take a long time to hurt: how to make someone physically in a very small space believe that they’re walking in an almost infinite open space – we’re working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also boulders.
At the moment, it is only average to deceive the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde petersbourgeoise" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, no matter where they are.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all red and not yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of the image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free ones, of my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except for words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took place in Pushkinskaya-10, which housed before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy songs in play-back in moldy jerseys, they included Igor Vdovin, a composer today in fashion.
When the group began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted quite a few shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong news and sharpness.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled for "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, one is interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we should spit on him instead.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Anyone but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquorish.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of bohemian love one thing, the nias another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikha<0xC3><0xAF>lov!
- It's people we've thrown out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything is wasted.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is a spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow today, there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are dismissed, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and pave the way for them.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who go to see exhibitions, concerts.
In our house, this layer is very fine.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project realized with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings on board set off in search of a life-saving planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a relief planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that you can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space with a focus on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were being carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo was developing.
A completely normal chick is obtained at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," says the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the chicks moved in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We have rubbed their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not realized for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
"No one answered that question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space scientist.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been in orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: Compulsory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
The water imitates gravity.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but still a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid in her mother’s womb, it is easier for her to get used to the water afterwards.
This is logical in principle, because from its birth until its first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weight is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach and pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the birth simulators.
One can of course prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the attraction of the earth, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
We can not dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled, completely unsuitable child," predicts the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for Control of Public Finances) said: "The control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging behind in its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances, said in an interview with Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us,” Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system as an example of abusive practice.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs are not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls, so is it allowed or forbidden?
“The law must be applied in some way, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority responsible for going to inspect from demanding compliance with the law,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice proper to it.
We have collected all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "more severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this kind should precisely contribute to the fact that we stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and to improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, this objective will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so submerged in paperwork that those who seek faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
Competences are also somewhat similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has courses of accounts of this type at the level of the different L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by us by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, but in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the law on public procurement already meant to you as an institution?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for the "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become stricter and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law stricter in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDO will not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go and inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing were.
The law on markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
The roads are in frozen places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5°C and -10°C but they should rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have stopped in the area and there is only a thin layer of snow left in the plains.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service showed that visibility was reduced in some places due to fog.
The R6 expressway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
It still remains on some of their sections of the remains of frozen snow and in some places clogged by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that traffic-damaged snow layers can be found on the roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
The road maintenance services warn drivers against the risks of glass formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located at an altitude.
There may be glass in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow laden with traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with possible cloudy periods.
There will be a light wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3°C and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places greater vigilance and adaptation of driving to weather conditions are required.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillating between -3°C and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes can be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway can be used almost without difficulty, however, the road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between the 80 and 131 kilometres.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less-frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at high altitudes today must count on a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the neck called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go on the ground that night; according to road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should expect to encounter a thick and soft layer of snow at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass," the head of road maintenance services in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues in the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also visited the site during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are easy to follow, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, drivers should pay attention to the wet roads in forested areas.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the maintenance services of the roads of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south-east of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic problems have been reported so far.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of glass, in particular around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowfall during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
Difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec are also reported from the main traffic lines.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said, “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and think that we are the only group capable of collecting a positive energy balance in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you set up a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the eve of 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will virtually end by the time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap together with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled " End of the Cancelled World " (in Czech " Konec <0xC5><0x9B>v<0xC4><0x9B>ta avlukceno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charity concerts too?
Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k who also holds the leading role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to have them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on for the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the Tap Association, for the past six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers perform on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere will perform with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there, too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks like it at first.
We have five members in electric chair whose machines have to travel in a hold, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
Until now everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that to the east all is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
In what way do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we have lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It is true, creating links with well-known singers and actively working on the promotion of the band helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural...
But mercy is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, which we must take in pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it’s not just a breakthrough for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
And the only one left, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and go out, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when The Tap Tap's song "End of the Cancelled World" will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds (in the amount of CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo multifunctional training centre located in Prague in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned astronaut propagandist, his contribution being rewarded in part by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
In 1925, a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was intended to propel or brake the drain.
The only known information about this drain is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is apparent from the documents retained that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric rocket, designed by the engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were aimed at military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Probleme, which contains four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics.
By that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zaraniewicz (1902–1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-stage rocket flight tests of the RM-2 were started in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded the first rockets of the RM type.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
The entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
This decision has given rise to a lively discussion in the public mind.
It is certainly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of the freedom of trade and the free movement (without limits) of private capital allied to unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wage) generate a tension on prices.
This term should be understood as meaning that a producer strives to resist economic competition by "making more expensive" the price of the competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, or buying at low prices, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the state necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect ill will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate the economic and social damage caused to the whole society by this race for the benefit of.
This situation is at such a point of public notoriety that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force economically its own population to accept the dictates of the prices of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot provide for their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement in order for them to reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century), or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of capital, in the private sector.
The question must be asked here: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, weary of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
One must then ask oneself whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, direct politics and, by the same token, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually omnipotent lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the drafting of laws to law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long in decline and the functions were attributed to violence.
Whistle blows, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold. ... ... " The honest people did not at all seek to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls." ... "It really began to be said that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was an autocracy.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out reforms in depth.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be considered as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are witness today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen the state's capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," Sting said in the song titled Fragile, whose main line from the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons did not want wars, there would be none,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel’s side, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians as terrorists, others support Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in this political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view behind the curtain, on the one to which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have already lasted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely, of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every age, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their acts to the throne to someone who directed their acts according to pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to end the links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of the Russian-controlled central bank Qaddafi only 4, between the Russian-controlled Qaddafi and the Russian-controlled central bank).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America's status as a central bank and began to issue his own money during the Civil War (government, I understand well) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being the ultimate solution to anything else).
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order according to the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
Having succeeded in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the second world war, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany faraminous reparations of war thus generating the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a leader who is not strong enough, and to show that they are willing to do so).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or whether everything he did was planned, however, the fact is that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people sharply divide between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong leads to another wrong in an endless cycle of violence and where one finds, at the root of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we have to make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in our country, international bankers only offer people in elections to their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything in order to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) spread to become a global conflict and, given the fact that the world's economy is not controlled by Iran.
As David Rockefeller put it in 1994: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to wear on their hands or foreheads a red iron mark, so that they cannot buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number denotes man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: when everything goes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees ran away from the embassy.
After difficult journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team who came to make marks for the shooting of a great science-fiction show film.
Combination of genders
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a political thriller conceived in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow each other: sequences of Tehran documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first of Affleck’s films not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where Tehran's role is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that in fact offered few exciting scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dispassionate character, due to the need to show too many events at too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-ops, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the job.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the settlement contest or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision," Patrik Nacher, the organiser of this survey, told the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they are, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add bio-components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages, which has increased the price of the cages.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butterfly" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimetres in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or present an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it only harmonises non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
The fruit and vegetable standards have been eased despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation according to which must appear on inflatable balloons a warning indicating that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US investigation that balloons are, among toys, the first cause of choking deaths of children.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We, too, have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that may be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, do not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea is a handicap for us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), which were to be used, in concrete terms, to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says "bizarre regulations are rare".
While the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning as well as its overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always emerge as a winner) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", as for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not on beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, today in the company of cheeses known worldwide as Feta or Gorgonzola, L<0xC3><0xBC>beck pasta or Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("Poho<0xC5><0x99>elick<0xC3><0xBD> and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>k<0xC3><0xBD>").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ick<0xC3><0xBD> tubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how do you plan to run in the presidential election?
It's not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been plundered for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and key, and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to come up with a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, a member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run in presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out for the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau (N.D.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have elected you?
I've always said that I'll fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run in the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we roar at the bar or in front of our television station, but it is also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I am a journalist or that I was the advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s come to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [from CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I put pressure on tour guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent, non-party member, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without the categorization and dogma of supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a leftist or a rightist?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little to the left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are on the left or the right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act just as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you have only slogans.
You won’t survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don't want to.
When there is a strong personality who will identify the abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President by direct suffrage, which was obtained through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, without hesitation, that I am an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to get things moving, and if it doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run in the Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1> who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to found your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don't have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my "transparent" account.
Don't you have any money?
When it comes to tax returns, what’s yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a boy’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth $60 million and you don’t have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program does not generate much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live with it, for example, paying my son’s English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for election.
Are you going to continue your business in order to live?
Didn't you say you'd put your business to the test?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I'd end my business.
You can find this interview in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>va newspaper.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the lower side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large neighboring company, tells us, “Yes, it’s really beautiful, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad, and e-books.
Today, no one goes willingly in one of these shabby libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The 80,000-soul municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brain, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam office of architects MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, bewildered and raising their shoulders, Maas, the confrontational, stacked his choice books in order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common dog!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain has sprung up.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This is how this small, dull village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of stunning ugliness, whose white facades invite you to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you walk through the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant spotlights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library beams are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been neatly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment center and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes slabs, sometimes railings, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the hardened architects and engineers of the building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a Frisian agricultural company an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of one millimeter thick have been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary cafe offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Donations for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunshade, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "soul finally found".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely filled (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library."
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
Thus MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose abstinence.
Why? !
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in adopting a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are fighting on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find that role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What, then, does the term “normal” foreign policy mean to the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national files.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a determining factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not a purely one-sided relationship.
But this is at least a determining factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected than that.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you’ll notice that Obama is far from over enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany experiencing difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must assert their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or does she still have a hard time taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still having difficulties playing a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very varied neighbors and opinions, and it’s not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant and if they are less appreciated, it's life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a brand officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a win.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few more letters to be able to register their marks.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing the recordings made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that practically only sell counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: his bosses charge him with attacking the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to complain about.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to erase dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period of time, the criticised name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought out concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the buyer of Volvo, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of the BMW logo before the conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year, the office would have gone from an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a found normality".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending at the office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth time in a row.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record averaged 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds, "the procedure is long, laborious and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the archives department has even had to review the records of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered in vain to the opposing party a “large sum in six-figure euros” to settle the dispute.
“That’s what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit Freudenberg’s name in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “vigilance is of the essence.”
Pattloch and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, rather foreigners should "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping your foot, singing, helping
The Imbongi Choir repeats itself in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland’s AIDS rejoice at their coming.
Here is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men look for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the singers’ voices slowly amplified – alto, bass, tenor and soprano – they won, enchanted and followed each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man in the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every chorister has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi in Zulu means "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or earth huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that plague Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population practically never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that since then has dealt with the orphans of Esitjeni's AIDS in an almost professional way.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhagia (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and bile belong to the parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydial-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhea, and the human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the number increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, abdominal pain as well as the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners to undergo regular examinations.
Most fast-detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the donations, but especially the funds that the choristers collect thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
“In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, in one of their grandmothers.
Gogos, so called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because even though the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His Fourteen Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches on sexuality.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned attitudes, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms can still be found on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh versus flesh.”
In order to somewhat foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still know about the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears out a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their filleuls.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers by bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers who tap their feet in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, you can also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps from asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one is linking the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other life-essential elements arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unprecedented inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the more difficult-to-identify pink dots are the "newborns" in the birth chamber of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has photographed the blazing glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed this galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more colors in value.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name of Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three tracks of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambola in the constellation of the Serpent: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush toward each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname “Southern Fire Wheel”.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula, in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The circle of black holes is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also constantly create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge, the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter is still about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its great light-gathering capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by using the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on Mauna Kea's Hawaiian volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the south pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

A survey of a country in which one is still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is one of awe-inspiring romance.
At the side of the many turns of the road, the small bus stumbles along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, one would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where lives the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh, about which not much is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and they have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastron with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not fit at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the trip from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have been married three times and would have had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov have been wrong a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man in the middle ages of Central Asia.
“Amazingly old people also live in certain areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is a fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem plausible that Talysh’s high-calorie meals, which like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barrack, whose content she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also play in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical, belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blonde that her son reveals to us with pride.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats a month (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-greying son is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The Sharia-based draft constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not averse to words full of emotion.
We need to succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was intended for the whole people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all the members of the confused and hopelessly disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his "in order to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the overwhelmingly Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nightly curfew are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
What does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists are using the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia.
In any case, it is that which makes one think of a newly introduced article stipulating that, with regard to all matters relating to sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance shines over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the judicial power being placed under the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many aspects of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts were used to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, the draft reads, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of the art of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording implying that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon".
"The revolution was reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual accord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to bring down the sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the garbage bins of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in great numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Cleanse our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Koran [was] their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken out loud and loud.
According to them, now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot boxes of the leadership that the country must take.
The Islamists’ project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he's been hit, tried and jailed.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are a blatant violation of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto stripped him of all his powers,” Saeda said.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watch the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway benefit from one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to the locals’ appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and pour themselves a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it’s not bad – it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels, then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish is out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though odorous, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to his displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot down 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the “July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” explains Anna, our waitress, with her blond hair and eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in hand.
We are, as you say, prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the windows, in the years that led to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its stock market strings tight.
“As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Not forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and I do the tail to buy me something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where we serve rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the most smelly of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
We would believe in the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, the BBC's Will Grant is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the nation’s new president.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico's economy is doing well, with results owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A highly populated and sprawling state that envelops the capital. On its land of preference, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M. Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bogged down and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to put in place lasting changes,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who blame the new president for lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under highway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and the violence against women is particularly serious.
In a damaged area, the bodies of dozens of women killed in the past two years have been found on the edge of landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version states that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old commer, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he'll be as good as he was as a president when he was governor," Olvera, a member of Congress, said in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly the victim of during the detention.
The trial involved Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims he suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein and Manning examined the forms officers had filled out after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned her about her incarceration, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned him that restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to be stripped of that status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had contemplated suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once due to the heat.
He added that not being kept informed about what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had at his disposal were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning questions about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his briefs or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that conditions of detention were warranted.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been jailed in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, leading to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defense.
If all the heads of prosecution are detained, he faces criminal imprisonment for life.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extrangeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing which way to go.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede in writing half of their territory to the tip of the gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, that person matched a typical profile -- a dark, uneducated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they bite us as if we were individuals of lower stock and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with this alone, amigos.
It's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still love them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another outpouring of blood seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly deadlock.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the cease-fire granted on 21 November remains in place, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a landslide.
Having killed some of its leaders and repulsed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals in Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the Islamist crescent curves around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its rule, through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders more easily rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the box.
The missile interception system dubbed Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide bombings, including thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to fall into international disrepair.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why give these Palestinian fichus a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they come out the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the game.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a cease-fire which is a good thing -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, short-term and short-term, is that the cease-fire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state along the 1967 borders with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to set one up.
It's a very narrow vision.

Laws for neutral cigarette packs have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous depictions.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would re-launch the black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Harmful consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrific packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the high court.
He said Zico has sold 6,000 of them to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the target population segment of the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV commercials, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small shop window to promote your products, the Internet is the must-see place par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know them.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package away," Victor El Hage said when he bought a package containing a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that's gonna make me stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging makes it difficult to store packages on display shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but failing to get into a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a moody mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boring can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, bored people tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which participants listened to a tape, the voice of a person in the train.
Some groups heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the tape at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, a distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you’re doing a boring task, “like looking at objects on a editing string, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain motionless,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “boring predisposition scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom today, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescents are a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” particularly because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boost is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know which is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more mastery of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant whirlpool that generate activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the location than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been classified without consequence.
Police services have stopped charging adults 21 and older with minor marijuana possession, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” Aurora Police Chief Daniel J. Oates said.
The Washington State regulatory agencies are also asking themselves a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first of all in terms of use for therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,” he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the state’s mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis-selling businesses within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or daycare center.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales business, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" would no longer prosecute people 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Attorney of the Republic), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to have them detox.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer bringing in adults for possession of limited amounts.
County Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately file all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework appropriate to personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with public prosecutor’s representatives, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, too, do they have a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the verge of becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are anticipating a new legalized sales boundary, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still view the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police probably won’t push the doors to grab small bags of drugs, there’s a strong bet that they’re opposed to licensed marijuana-selling businesses for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration policy adviser.
Many cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we find ourselves faced with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far back as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after settling down at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated with facetiousness that I had left after being forced to drink in shattered cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away, because I had been bullied and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have found that a new generation of center-right students are suffering the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted” because of their political opinions.
They want there to be a representative on the University's Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not eased by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which focused on student politics, portraying the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", who moves to Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and moves with a chrome-plated cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for setting up increased tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are centre-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and of a paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm of Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy of striking miners, privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easily carried away.
"Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a harrowing tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is being targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most of the Tory youth claim to be Labour (workers).
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Ms. Thatcher said.
This scheme has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who shared the same views only after the nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years were going to look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he told me pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of directed work the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and treating them as "crazy old men."
The rest was short-lived.
It was my father who pushed the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press each week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a wet, slurred chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the focal point of a story whose only protagonist is "Mr." Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of the lineage of nobility
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-bred people and with the greatest titles and they like him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide which offers to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor who had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his wedding to the suitor.
Among this audience of models, there are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of its customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the muse's couturiers.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he exalts our beauty,” added the ex-duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors it uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
This was finally possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bust and a falling neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” said Rodrigue d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier thus calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of laces and a sled of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of customers of high society".
Nuanced for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani earns as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“Its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance have always caught my eye,” acknowledges d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my best friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano bearers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the earth's interior solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of almost 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There is only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano which peaks at 2,386 meters altitude, but the worn-out carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-like appearance, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents euros for every kilogram of sulfur extracted.
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, one might say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is triple what he would gain in the fields.
“The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, for whom they are hin
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Malminated by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy mass of wood with other carriers, rising every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not stop gushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to bearers who work on their account and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not humans,” protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", as he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain due to deformities and pain in the joints.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions and he extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur wearer.
Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let's fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video spread like a trail of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this ad.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves, what could be more creative about solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered as the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem by setting higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoeboxes” are selling out much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the wheel if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off later,” says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the final say.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has owned an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone knows them,” he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I won’t share one of my photos or someone who would make the fool,” he says.
The young boy admits that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nude people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are from the family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he added.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends, quickly,” he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on which he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one gave him any advance notice or asked for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A friend of one of my friends was racqueted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post pictures of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she says.
Porras points out that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Natives and Digital Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, it is they, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age where they don’t have the maturity to do so.”
“We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Their saying not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education advisor, says it is essential that parents read the conditions of use of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public.
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be released after the summit closed, then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final declaration,” but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of the Arab South America (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it also did not broadcast the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as it had previously been announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague that defines a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the arguments of both sides in the trial that Lima has tried against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court," President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” said President Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, handing over a hand to President Humala, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously flawed.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to favour a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," of which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It's possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
In the same way, as part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” Correa said.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "had interviewed each other during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president has shown support for the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who shake our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish court, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation in his territory regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation itself allows this to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked up in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It’s about anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he has a solution to London's discussion.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, has launched a series of proceedings with different European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain were to grant safe-conduct tomorrow, it would be over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has already done in other cases, interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interrogated him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and he said what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil or perverse politicians, but the bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroys the legitimacy of the demagoguery".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the sound resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to fight for a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we have to accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it will be my last presidential term and I will then retire from political life.
If we ever lose, I will too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to have tested positive for HIV.
"It's like the sky fell on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his hard work was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he took this scientific information as a reference.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of allocation of the immune system that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not consume a drug for years.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who is diagnosed with HIV at age 25, “as long as they remain under control, they will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years,” the scientist explained.
In order to place this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of the nationally identified patients are on the basis of data.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked drugs, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or else they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for that, we need to offer massive screening tests to all people who ask for it.”
Specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffocating cane.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better if I break out three times a week,” they say, “that’s not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march against the so-called World Day.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that you can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, that's very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: “What are you going to do about it?”, posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teens don’t want to hear.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in the public restroom dispensers and in the places where young people frequent.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez had said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
“It’s not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminations are done sexually, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every registered case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
Thus, it would appear that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, in contrast to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment rendered last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glassmaker to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in New Orleans, asserts that the main procedure is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had secured the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, that is, the "vautor" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis facing the United States, reproducing the costs to the country.
For now, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family society will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("court friend") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States law.
In addition, he noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they subdue Vitro and they subdue the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotting basketball player "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n as president-feker of both the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n and the president-feker of the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I’ve worn several basketball caps throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s,” Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora’s home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he has been living with Isabel, his fiancee of 50 years.
“Basketball has been my whole life.
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his extraordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the team of the Vaqueros in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“It’s been my best years, those I’ve taken the most advantage of because I’ve had the chance to participate in eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been in charge here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended me to Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He enjoyed the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's responsibilities in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we raked the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the team that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner replacing players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young man, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things that I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearful and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the full,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an alluring genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include well-received critical roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to entertain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation worldwide and millions of dollars played in wagers.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smiling man: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here's the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday Hagman as a "huge man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each and every one of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the channel has informed.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who rose to fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York theater scene in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires impitoyables de J.R)
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
"I advise them, I restore their confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and after," he says in 1996.
I try to offer them a little comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be okay."
He was also an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course dealing with the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a class on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “big countdown” on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the end of the impending world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the months that followed: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal chasm that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists thought it would trigger.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only teacher to give classes on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled "The End of the World."
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple and a native of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked a surge of speculation.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about it,” he says.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew we were teaching here on “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh about it together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
