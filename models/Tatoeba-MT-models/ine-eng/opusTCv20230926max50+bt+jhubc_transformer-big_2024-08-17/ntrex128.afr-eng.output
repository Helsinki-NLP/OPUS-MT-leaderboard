Members of the Welsh Assembly worry they're going "as it seems"
There is consternation among some members of the assembly over the proposal to change their title from AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but has noted that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of dumb or stupid.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received wide support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e appears to be proposing alternatives, but the battle to get consensus may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the Assembly's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to clear a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly made a cap against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing because churches in Harlem are fooling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"None of them are there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways," he said.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people regularly go."
As for churches, he's worried that the money from asset sales isn't going to last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they're back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people that won't help the neighborhood's remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring even closer to the day these churches completely close, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation withdrew in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, which did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What's been playing at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leakers of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, consisting of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese was "trying to pass on the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injuring 13-year-old in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobster on the first day of the California lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 pm. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then moved closer with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says at first he thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he's calling, 'I'm bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His whole key bone was torn open," Hammel saw as he came out to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries at the top of his chest.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with department store-type beauty aisles staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty aisles in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if it's a success next year it will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with trademark-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger shoppers are pushing for.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller amounts of food being bought daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the retail stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also launched a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, strengthened grocery sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how to split profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially-trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to cater to every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a commanding beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons star Peter Jones ran away "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their homewear and accessory brand, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
This Morning's provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "angry" when TV's golden girl on Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she no longer has enough time to their home-clothes-and-accessibility-dealing, best-seller.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune, according to insiders.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and swapped Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority at a distance.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to remove her completely blew the minds of all concerned.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right for sale."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's most cash-flowing stars, could drive the firm millions out of pocket due to the sheer investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to cleaning and household clothes, and the possibility that its launch could cause even more delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
It's hard to say, "We fall in love."
He mocked criticism he was going to get from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma-newsletter.
"I didn't give up anything."
He mentioned Kim's interest in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders' summit in Singapore, that the North did not see a "consensual response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping up the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic turn in his convention speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing just there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Earthquake and earthquake in Indonesia destroys island, kills hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is in the process of putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the ongoing earthquake that Indonesia is enduring, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even if it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's interlocking infrastructure a key point of his election campaign, spending cash on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is being trampled by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sweeping sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs with hooded knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons have fought in the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave up for Sturridge when he was out of the Chelsea goal for about 30 years and his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal.
The attempt sailed high across the window as it swung to the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball bounced over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in the only case.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea were ahead 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goaltender returned to Mateo Kovacic in that back-to-back playroom before pitching near midfield and scoring in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then introduced Hazard to the frame.
Hazard crossed the defence and ended up with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool will take on Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian Tsunami Hits 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Numerous people have reportedly been trapped under the rubble of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, to collapse, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed to death at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Spectator Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything from day one to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman appeared at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's loved ones.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
It has been reported that one police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She said repeatedly, “It’s so disgusting.”
At 2pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to dial @MerPolCC, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Cromwell's Statute of Parliament Becomes Latest Commemoration Hit With 'Rewriting History' Twiss
His exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sickness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The image storm of the English Civil War was still ordered to be carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's multifaceted depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate picture is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that divide.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
The Chinese Farmer's Cut
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery covered with blood near a stall at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig farm.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," the cousin, who was named after him, "Wu," the Guiyang Evening News quoted him as saying.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the Markov authorities are negotiating alleged compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack humans have reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared off the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was fed by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"They're not playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Hurricane Rosa is going to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa on Sunday had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 p.m. east, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastwards to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous tick floods, waste flows, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause site-to-site rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Kite floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep gorges to hit wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a bit of local heavy rain to parts of Southern California's coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth fishing lanes.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will allow Arizona to start moving closer to rain on Sunday and early Monday late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start hot in October, with widespread 80's from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are watching Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched the gripping testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford on Thursday on six television networks, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-go turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had beaten her in drunkenness and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartwarming testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure what people are looking at in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where whistleblowers shouted at him when he tried to take a lifter to a Judicial Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down, while CNN vividly depicted how he became ill.
"I'm right here for you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him: "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and went ahead of the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judiciary Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority has requested.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is due to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should counter each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the hijacking.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial review office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police, and area citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "effort and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball star Will Wade said the team was "flattened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," Wayde said.
It's like a volcano in Mexico City
As seen from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital have reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center has multiple rotations and shakes monitor.
Images on social media showed how thin low-gas engine windscreens covered near Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists in commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police sprayed them with eggs and powdered paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets usually teeming with tourists.
A mutiny also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their batons to keep the fighting going.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang "No forgetting, no forgiveness" in one tone in confrontation with the Unionists' cry of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the marches, local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but is being celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but the turnout was low, with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the rally from continuing at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in advance of their role in organising the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reverse the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after motor toe home vasry
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly tethered to a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some point after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was proof of the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remained unbeaten in the Premiership this season and will face the forerunners Heart, who are eight points ahead of them, next week.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extend their undefeated run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still undefeated since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chance of bot visitors
Holt's team had to advance long before they scored a goal, with their round-the-clock bust that brought Rangers all sorts of trouble to their necks.
SR broke through, but turned in front of the goal corner, when AL could only play wide after he came closer and met CH's header across the goal corner.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could get the visitors with death spell moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the frame.
At that point, Rangers dominated possession but could not push through the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued into the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a resurgence of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow went wide to avoid Livingston's open game.
Crossroads have repeatedly reached Livingston’s window and turned repeatedly, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – have been ruled out.
Livingston’s ‘Fenomenal’ – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward path.
Their playing style and crew have remained almost unchanged since their return to first-class, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his many defense arrangements while Menga kept their tunes for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout.
The Rangers were inspired.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they couldn't maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in mid-division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had an outburst on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque but numerous supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also cast their votes, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting protests reflect the divisiveness of a visitor hailed by some German Turks as a hero and extorted by others as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London in which a car was involved.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and alert his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Custodians Injured in Riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
The operation broke out around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Special "Tornado Keepers" were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious riots during which staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Pink Threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfloede (Drought Areas Trek Maybe Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings with it tick flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued curfews for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be approaching with rain by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Comet, are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those out of danger of a typhoon, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is ravaged by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme droughts, the second highest category."
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to land approach across the Baja California Peninsula from Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore its power is decreasing.
It is therefore expected to reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys, a 20-year-old man, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teen boy was found Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he is still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "gone under the commonwealth, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and shocking tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "lying under the commonality, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her claim.
The president said on Saturday the Americans had seen Kavanaugh's "brilliant and quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a law with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred directly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for this candidate everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds dead due to Indonesian shaking, tsoenami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a beach party when firefighters from up to six meters (18 feet) high broke down at the bottom of the beach, washed away many after their deaths and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, dumps, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the Tsuenami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coast was still covered.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "remarkable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake's core.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building sounding desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami screaming at the people downstairs in the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the footage.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began shipping cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsoenami death toll rises above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where workers are sheltering in canopy shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they bypassed on their way to scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the gruesome task of setting up the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only be deployed after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can open it up to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the wonders that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national screen weaver team, has fielded two of the missing screen weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the false screen field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated on social media among the fake screen weave community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who took part in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with a gray checkmark, instead of two blue checkmarks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during OTM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a Newport Police Station news release.
The car's driver was busy emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to hand over more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been using the nickname Ye for quite some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons," the program's producer said.
Aside from the fact that it's an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come out with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to take control of the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people to gangs.
U.S. to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced their plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired influential people from other universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to support the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that aims to engage partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire last month.
Macedonians vote in election whether to change country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to track admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of unrest at 1 nm.
But the rise was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and drew up chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A backlash in the referendum will be the first serious backlash to the policies of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates the entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence from the road in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian goaltender received a lead at midfield at the start of the series.
He chased through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton goal corner.
He then pushed a coin to the left, where he found it for Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're glad he scored a goal at that point."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touchdowns before leading Sterling to the farthest goal corner.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City take Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 nm. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to push another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoffs for the Rockies, which have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least one promotion spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to clinch their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowds and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outs in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible means, one sees the commonality, the vulnerability.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees this over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and gullible and fake."
He referred to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh orders from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It's unbearable to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Workers’ Party LPs who’ve been told we’re not welcome – all because we’ve said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because she has unflinchingly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues on which Jeremy has differed from previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers' Party LP, it was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendly, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers' Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, expected me to start a U-turn and take positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tirade of scathing language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, rejection of politics from the core and telling me not to be in the Workers’ Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "movement of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party is getting scarier.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I would then be "okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Workers’ Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that has literally left my state high school failing, I’ve tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councilor or government minister.
I've never had a problem with politics, especially in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending off on a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether their now members of the Workers' Party are or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will deter me from doing what I believe in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is an LP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late threes may have slightly skewed the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the point ladder, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better batsmen, who carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "In honor of Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was scored by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot to score a three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest, scored a solo three to make it rest 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, scored by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the outset Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, scored by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for killing for Climo without the ball, and from the penalty spot MacPherson put the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr loss.
Climo scored it, as he also did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's about to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
It looks like Still Game star will move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved with Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked court hopes to reopen to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a mass-worked naval barracks in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are punctuated with the slogan: "The sea is ours by rights.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the countryside of Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as is the need to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to be the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia waits for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of collusion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial re-election battle next year – also has a lot to do with Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to recognise Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH’s ruling comes just six months after the last demonstrations shows that the case “wasn’t complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tapped into any remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct late-night talks.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extraordinarily fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the shipping issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore-North Korea summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. capitulation to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang taking any meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second round of talks.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about distancing itself from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely dislike the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have introduced a range of cool oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the runway that have captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have permeated Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their stunning creations on the runway.
The highlighter by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a four-faced wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving goggles included, while another looked like a melted cream ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the great fashion trend, it's your lucky day.
Stylists predict that the enormous guard may be on its way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-edged straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social sent another great creation over the course of time – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffles and finished with a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in stores for next summer – as the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zenith of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 schoolchildren across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their schoolchildren and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see world languages continuing as a popular and desirable subject matter in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages above are the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolchildren who studied foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as subjects, have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employees are struggling to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in today's children's language learning.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Exactly how many minutes he'll be playing has yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies in the next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm election because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how does one look online after that?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can check out the live stream below after Trump's rally in West Virginia.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote that has been held back for up to a week while the FBI sets up an investigation.
But the main point of this excess of contractions is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said that these five gatherings in the next week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans seek to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game teams were only what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is an overall refined sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions such as these.
Where would they say it's the moment?
"They went six points ahead and now it's four, so we wear it as a bit of momentum, I guess," Spieth said as he ran away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more to be played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a bit of wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not the least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and scored every three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the top to the clean field and led by his example.
That score celebration crept harder as his round progressed and he sunk a critical set to win game four completely ejected while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds with two.
His set-up that won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that says to a man that he believes the U.S. team has another chance.
"You really just have to take it all out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's what these players are up to now.
18 pieces of paper to print their stamp.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but charming couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't like one on Saturday afternoon over job rate, but they also liked one on Saturday morning over job rate as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from these exuberant crowds, confirm that they are the players to be beaten Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can spark a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Choose both at the same time or at different times.
It is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief spells with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold over track score and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole from which they could hardly even come.
There's no one out there to help you out on Sunday.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep track of due to the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has always played better as a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe will run 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score soaring at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who are trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. fielded more resistance in the four games and won two games, but they didn't shrink the backlog.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named after a sensational weekend "Moliwood," are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a papa Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2-1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a gust of wind southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team recover from a four-point setback when they entered the single-game, though Furyk's team only had to play in a draw to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem like they'll get a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "definitely not" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would exacerbate its mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "meaningful benevolence measures" in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to degrade nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, according to which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump assured North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is pushing for the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerting more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader drew attention to earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party in this issue on nuclear weapons destruction was South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons would not have reached such a point in the Korean Peninsula."
The tone of Ri's speech, however, was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would be aimed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "fireman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but he said much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timeframe for this, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the application of sanctions by the Security Council must proceed diligently and without ceasing until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to delay funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later of making "benign claims."
North Korea has vowed in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures."
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough Russian.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine-fueled 'all-night sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often dishonest when it comes to the basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one has ever told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to enter the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know this won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes is," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to "study all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of starvation, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he attended one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to strive for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and lead you to succumb to it.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeat Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another sarsey away day heartache when Dolly Menga's goalie Steven Gerrard's uncoordinated team suffered a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only conceded to Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which led loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would have looked like without a lot of inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown away.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his nods with the way his well-trained team had battered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score points after just two minutes when Menga's first pitcher Scott Pittman passed on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss at the rear goal post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed like there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to get a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a goalie from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett catching the ball long after long.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner point.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty head when he got through with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE COUNT ON... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Okay, this is about to crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to 'see' predator cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predator cells
Vaccine learns immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predator cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers and called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells worked to knock out some sort of leukemia.
Kanye West started acting pro-Trump after his appearance on SNL while wearing a MAGA hat.
This didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a protracted performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, which is called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's shell was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to spot for West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the scenes about what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me in the back of the elevator.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've been bugging me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "super coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments attracted at least twice a show to the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication, "The whole studio went silent."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, drummer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING AGAINST THE SCARE."
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts an ideology and proclaims that endangers my community.
He is free.
"Me too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the being that was known earlier than Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rhythmicist, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, old-fashioned Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture, saying he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "fairly strong" about making this issue work.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up about the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is quite possibly responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something has gone wrong with our young people."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he is "finished with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will be playing in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a rover.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave it to my future family, and my life from here on out," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday issued a statement alleging that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are fueled by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts is related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false claim - was not responsible at all for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be challenging.
He didn't question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused by critics of being apparently too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to get Waters out of the polls in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are brought to justice," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - blur Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-themed film and it seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy mock-franchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and struggled further with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how eye-catching power we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the awkward Johnny English with his cocky and rubber face has renewed his license to pick up everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot of those guys who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, which leaves chaos behind, which Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There's one or two fun moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who came running to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored suit and briefly cut the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is being showcased but the humor feels rather fuzzy and quirky, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as a component.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's counter-speed is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent-film jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perennial thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-cracker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a pitiful little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a bloated and beleaguered character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political inaction: Emma Thomson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is at risk, she must summon someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but giving off record lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and reunited with his former long-time companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely dive into Her Majesty's secret service again and come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of mocking escapades: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get familiar with Volta's house.
Nothing is spared for that last scene, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is pretty much like children's TV.
Reasonably mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really puts his talent right?
Labour denies it's considering a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but be paid for five days.
The party wants to claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution must be passed on to workers by giving them an extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say it would "fit in" with the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Workers' Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a workers' government can make "withdrawals" on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent equity in private sector enterprises to employees, which can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley voiced Republican sentiment. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could fathom anything they could change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, "Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unquestioning."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a charge of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has fervently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars performing and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a BBP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions," such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to educate them.
But just how successful was the 12-year-old who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, W<0xC3><0xB6>rldburger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the money confirmed so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and vowing to give $35 million for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they gained more than 4,700 tweets from W.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with dietary restrictions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
World citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use fleet for 'blockade' to curb Russian energy exports - Home Affairs Minister
"If necessary" Washington can leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seas are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single-talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow "prisoners."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest sport," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Two-and-a-half percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to potentially stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Names Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning," she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the departure" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given for the country."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support new asylum policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing deep-seated problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy," the friend-of-the-court court order said.
Lawyers further argued in the lawsuit that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems—not even all the serious problems—that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly puzzling.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she consoled her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for impoverished possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has gained a fractured back and shoulder, rests outside Palu's military hospital where patients are treated outside due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm stuck in the rubble, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's state newspaper with the most sales - after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, noted U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds equating each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war aimed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited dissenting voices at the street newsstand here in Beijing and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shyed away from offering to publish its article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican women's ouster in midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While numerous top Republicans stand by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this run extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) push for an FBI investigation into the nipper would be enough to quell angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is on the way!" as they spoke in the Senate's entrance portal while the Republicans who chose to control the Judiciary Committee continued Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony outlining the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It's become a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh likely or definitively cheated during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's instigation, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominees exposed his genders to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a startup trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee remarked that the idea with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it depends entirely on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about introducing an overall change whether or not, where all of their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross spiritual feast
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled on Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vand on 29 September 1918 led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed him to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he stormed a man-only field gun and knocked out three of the division.
Lt. Kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never do confess, but something that is discouraging."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling horrified to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a bunch of people."
MMA fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as a "some sick joke."
"It's government regulation that the content at 6pm was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's acid in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our supporters and just went about our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has 'inferior' feelings about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but this gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had lied about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that to become a parent, he cared less about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, those feelings are less felt than, and otherwise, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he is "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he's smelling his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught him off guard.”
Daley was married to the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last good things he asked was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that that's what I'd dreamed of for a long time - diving in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song contest – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive on and pulls out of Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get his form right to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-breaking 12th time in the two-year event, was pulled out by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four numbers at the game.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being a racial leader and working on the practice bench at his game in the hope of correcting that scar.
Even at the peak of his career, he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long field always punishes the dizzying trees.
And as if the job on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles matches well, Mickelson's game can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Heroes and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I've put more into the prospect, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the player who played the most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed untold aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to shave the crazy, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
It's more than just a game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's singles play in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only won the toss with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the toenails," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching how the 2018 Class of Golf went from 5 to 6 before LeGaller.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say full-time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players risked their lives on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never get ahead of things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to sail better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Fury himself had already met on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every derogatory word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 bravely spoke to his players on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts to go in one direction, it places a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and classified the men we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and comes into the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The German military's latest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel was to join the Navy in 2014, but the harrowing post-delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home docks.
But continued delays mean that the advanced warships – which will apparently enable Germany to project power overseas – will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
The disaster-stricken F125 frigate made storage last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after delivery to a shipbuilder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also came to light that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing work performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also touched on an issue.
It apparently reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are in the process of being touched."
The official said the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been put out of service, but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano squirrel mouse as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton butterfly mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine what species do.
A Habitat Map and Report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as weeding and how to best manage forestlands for bats and other associated species.
Mushroom populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleep space and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The mouse isn't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ego orientation technique to point out goggle gas and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleep-leak inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that is still unknown, that's why the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the necessity of looking for bats before conservation in properties is done because it is possible that the unwitting destruction of a single nursery site could mean up to 400 females and toddlers' deaths and could wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them from destroying their sleep spots.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to challenge German magazine's ruling
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to challenge German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to challenge Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called an "inadmissible report of suspicion in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he is "99 percent" a "good old" who was left behind by the "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and this summer, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal, moved to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if its automakers lose
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us to not only enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to continue what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs in the long run could reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's co-founder at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the feud over nominees for the Supreme Court's Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of law by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to sack the deputy attorney general, and threaten Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's scandals for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a tape recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate bench hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump read out a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed by another week with all the other things that are going on with the High Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Gasser Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a bias for TV journalists who are "effect-seeking," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect-seeking."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of this and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times bizarre appearance to journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter to me, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also tightened their preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I put each staff member's contribution on the price, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the sidelines and sort of just colluded there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and withdrawn for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/scope of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving away from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead bodies.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The actions will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government's plans to tackle homelessness.
The surcharge – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – could be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in seal taxes to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to distance herself from quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain’s “housing disaster.”
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of pre-existing housing improvements, including rent control and an end to "no-fault expulsions".
He also wants to give the council greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can't be right that it's as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the tops.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it's something that pulls me back.
"But the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he feels no fear of following such established names at such a big club after previously flaunting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, success for me will be measured by ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I will probably consider myself as successful only if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years long, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he says as he recalls how he took over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person has to go through on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to drive and now I'm doing it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 nm. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling pubs' incomes, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinks and pub groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Preferred sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, outside of restaurants' own grounds.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking spots and pubs fared better and went up more than what restaurants went down.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Regularly run pubs and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman, from relaxation and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be especially difficult above and beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we've experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinks and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show for parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo sharing industry Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "main account" to show for parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voting for athletes" at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, could not walk after having a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it completely recovered, learned again how to walk and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast-pumping advertising that compares moms to cows shares opinions online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straws and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
The chorus reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it underplayed the "ugliness" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Because we need to get them pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "Understanding traumas for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for moms who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screamy" for her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had always been breastfed.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another noted: "It's a fun ad aimed at moms who are lactating (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead quiet, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly in a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, Partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in a fun way that people can connect with the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has caught the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border agencies have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to fierce rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children on bail.
Traditionally, most bailiffs were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by moving forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential bailiffs and other adult members of their households would have to hand over their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to insure unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either bailiffs or family members of bailiffs are illegal here in the country and a large chunk of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we continue to prosecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for emergency loan will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily overlooked due to size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more still uprooted, "is almost over."
He said Damascus would continue "to carry out this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "reconstructed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of indictment and scandal ends his presidency early.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of eye strain.
Since 2014, peak-time key figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top of the charts with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand," Neal Baer, program manager for the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and reshape the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you are in your sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” from his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 full-grain leather-flying jacket (“a garment thick of the Postbrys has,” according to The Washington Post).
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's varying cast and daily kinks in the plot (such as looking for russie with N.F.L.
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't tear him away, wasn't with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we did all those crazy shows back then and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out now they were right."

Out-of-pocket stream to the most exciting mid-term election race in the House
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift in congressional districts that has left two officials now in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a nail-biting win in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. has considered penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners ousted the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the gathering for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus on his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia cooperated in the country’s attack on our elections.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his gate group.
It’s a clumsy axis, and by that I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – and neither is that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be drawn out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is being hastened or slowed down.
Americans now face several such turning points in the face.
What will we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to cover up the president and speculated about whether he was in charge of his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we put those tests to the test, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that lived in my ambassador's house at the time.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With this coming of mine, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna match
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive league result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a lycopene count is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great day in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowds on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
"Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-being factor in place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully, we can now push through, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women are losing sleep due to fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes long before time runs out.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the pass.
Get a health care authority in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you can't communicate.
You'll also need to consider authorized for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windshield
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, emergency loan officials could not get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A Tsuenami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major tremor off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths off the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat quake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it did not lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major tremors hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shooting destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Hearing Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, certainly" when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B felony, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is pending before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsoenami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people’s deaths – a rare punishment not yet carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to mow pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "objectively" killed the eight victims and "objectively" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry the potential death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder in favor of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deliberate planning and foresight," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov conducted it as "disgusting, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has been legally prosecuting a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after they were convicted of a plot to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a life sentence with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says Nigel Farage should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the “heat” from Euroskeptics – as one of Theresa May’s own LPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone said for the March in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to unify her deeply divided officers was highlighted by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan afloat amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies have insisted that she will push through in her attempt to strike a deal with Brussels despite the death toll – forcing Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone said for the Loop Sign Loop event in Solihull that he wanted to "throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in control, we would have been out by that time,” he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers."
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone pointed out proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unwilling with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unwilling with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Let's go checkers, please, and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farge said that the assembly politicians should have felt the "heat" if they were on the verge of breaking the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It's about a trust issue between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a meeting for two hours in the city centre.
A few activists waved Tories against Brexit bans after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application as the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an overall wisdom.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard after’ to stand for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
A resident asked her if she planned to stand for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to straighten out our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims has sustained a gunshot wound to the head and is finally dead as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, possessed a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 forwards last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to drive far behind in the pack in traffic, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes kicked a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed to wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver obsessively risk-free to see the inside left at the risk of abstinence after a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the road sprint grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round at the pits, but was unable to accelerate his fit in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri had done fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad lift.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally over her insistence that she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he commented that what went on in the Senate showed that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you sure?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it much."
Well, wait a minute.
We liked it...No, we didn't like it," he added, in a presentation from the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't like her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I'm telling you what. It was really bad lift language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst lift I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominees accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to care about to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have reconciled for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by pitching from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee to a close before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals clinched their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost games and then won Friday night Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth gathering of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford fielding the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provisioner for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants take lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again caught them with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of winning with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people got off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely take off.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he saw it tumbling together.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're heartbroken to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still under the building falls while many cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters, palu roared that will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-martial is being plundered orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to eviction.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after seaplane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the air hostess panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said ships working close to improving a key also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people back and forth on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts say that the woman's body was burned alive.
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was at his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "joking because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's a black person?!
New York City's New York City Police Department Says It's 'Racist'
A New York child bride sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrongly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "an even black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compares the incident to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, smelled her dismay when she found out that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day at work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE N<0xC3><0x93>G A BLACK PERSON," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice.
After discovering her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman thanked me Maurice and said that they had done bad work for an outgoing child girl who was African-American and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident works for which she was initially appointed, even though it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple backtracked on the allegations that they were racist and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment and feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were unchaste, even if it were by abuse?
Your new-born baby?
Come on now."
Plasco compared the case to "depression" and said his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're only going to kill one person?"
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the case was still going on, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple to social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bittersweet".
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't an apple-eating man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he considered Paddington's success kind of that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say hello to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, hartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly coming up and leaving her system.
She's been dead for a while and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was unfolding.
I couldn't think or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at the time was suffering from the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head shaved and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened up any departure."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Ms Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
"Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It's breaking a hole through the family.
This divides us.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - a timeless investigation that has no cutlery - we might be able to bring in a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" among cut-throat partisan gatherings.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's all because of timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as is expected, the Republicans leave badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called on senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI filed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a league game and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea says 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 landslides last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fly via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China regards the migrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred around the striking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical,” says he is incompetent to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally incompetent to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, they would say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at the time he almost screamed and squeaked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disempowering himself with those positions and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not entitled to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently on," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Omgegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of rage that overcooks, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think I'm having trouble.
I'm angry."
And then she just walked in.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for thumb because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed at my neck by an older woman - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a trap.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was kidnapped in an extra-legal relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think much of it," she told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finding collections and so she made a promise that she would not enter the races unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would only give $250.
"Do you think I'm going to give up?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism - that she stung.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate guarantor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war had been overwhelming and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation this week involved new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time and has recently slapped tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to equalize the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means handing over requests, but meeting US requests in public would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure over US trade war over long-term China can be positively supported by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what viewers have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the midst of New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had secured the invasion.
Europe sealed Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final point of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-shirt blown in the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari blinked in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest ranking, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
Thank you so much for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch over to his compatriot John Ram who on Sunday beat US-based Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
"The incredible pride I feel in winning Tiger Woods, I've grown up and looked after those guys," Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find the cleanup field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we had a little bit of heat in Europe.
We've scrapped it.
Beware of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You've got to keep your hat on.
We are overwhelmed."
