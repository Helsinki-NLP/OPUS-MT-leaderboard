Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with Norway’s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee's own precinct.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but has not yet decided which ones.
His program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price at first.
For example, he mentioned having the feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice accused the president of the Association of nature protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of blackmail.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site proceedings and was demanding money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for the Litomerice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting bins on every street corner.
What about Brno?
There, it would take you several minutes before finding the right buckets.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort out the waste in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that the city councilors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of bins dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It is a science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found so far is the Moravian Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but I don't think it's very much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a tramp to get to the bins.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored buckets on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is likely that ecology and a so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league of hockey that shames the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after dragging a moment on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the whole region of South Moravia.
Paroubek's Budget Removed Argentinian Pensions and Sick Leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even civil servants it may be that there is a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interests on the debt of the state or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back on later, undermining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on borrowed money is increasing and will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice about where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenses, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will therefore not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow faster and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be $5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections of which it is not possible to modify the projects to possibly reduce costs.
At the very least keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state owns for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were shipped from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or they are used as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortage of one hundred million dollars in the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which should allow online monitoring of each administration's spending.
The first phase will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
One button is enough and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, which ran simultaneously the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The deserted slopes are not a problem only for ski lifts operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If you give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler offer for the moment only one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to place them for a while, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> can also propose the New Year in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer available places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," says Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a lot of interest during the January holidays of Poles and February sells well too," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central car park of J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is slightly weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly increase again, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e region should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowing in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, informs Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the station of Hradec of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repetition is mother of wisdom
He even becomes a comedian, the stubborn effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of sage, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he finally let his doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase “as in Iraq” several times in the text, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: “A New Road Forward.”
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a war-torn Iraq as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, that is, objectively speaking, it left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than could be hoped for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
Again, it was the campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite subordination habits.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the 10,000-strong general.
He succeeded in extracting the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems to Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this whole process in three years. Obama’s whole doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a halved increase will bring the same results as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leadership day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only a powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “prompt state to act”, which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is puzzling by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "immediate return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is heading towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of a solution to the problem through the use of military force.
We will have to respond, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this kind will, however, result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only downside for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time left for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank Executives Will No Longer Receive Cash Premiums
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent to bankers’ bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was given to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was given today to Charles Kao scientists for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The much-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is putting his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that Janota's budget and perhaps position in the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further exacerbates the crisis of public finances.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat briefed on the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his role with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left's proposals for money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which questioned the future of Fischer's firm which had been formed by agreement between the SDO, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the austerity package passed by Fischer's government and that it must curb the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreproachable deficiency" of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvement, if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDO President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget is staggering and the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "dramatic verdicts".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood’s new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose to the world a lot of things about the country, its battles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, that it was an eighty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to embody you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Million Dollar Baby located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against servitude himself become a slave, a fictional U.S. president, and even a God for ever-important man-of-all-life.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play that role so as to bring it closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it gets transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt,” he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he has six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, it opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the guidance of director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well done film."
In the reviews of movies on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only acknowledged yesterday that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the Bulava missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as the "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but that shines
This 13th test was normally carried out at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It's obviously the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving and submerged vessel
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a faulty "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk about absolute failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the damage hit only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Even though none of the test launches went off without a hitch, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even take ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the return of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to the AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
A spokesman for the Hyundai plant, Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, confirmed the news.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays at the end of the year indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in the comments and claims of unions such as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the auto plant were forced to work nearly two extra hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike state after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the auto plant management and the unions is due to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike if they agreed to their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged bribery.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, unions also called for workers who have stopped production not to be subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 209) for these.
The Hyundai automobile plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles as of September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "endurable" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality, in some cases, takes precedence over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as certain drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
Nevertheless, the life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their consumption results in a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarbons are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their connections to virus proteins.
Metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, the researchers said in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in trials as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbons is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further in order to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, Director of the Laboratory of Organic Biology and the Director of the Laboratory of Organic Chemistry.
Dispute over budget. The SDO is against Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the SDO (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, described the ratified budget for the following year as "scary" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO's remarks as a drastic verdict.
He said it takes time to analyze.
SDO spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the SDO and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether the House of Representatives supports the minority that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether it is concerned with remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and the Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments worth 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s grievance with the Social Democrats’ proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget be a less bad option than an interim budget.
Disappointment and Uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his post in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the Prime Minister on Monday after his transition to government:
He said at the same time that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not involved.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO have done nothing harmful, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of carrying out a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I did not think about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber of Journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO stepped back at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted on Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not expressly asked Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, did he respond to the question of whether the SDO had not suffered reproach on the part of the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missed.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevism of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said in person.
According to the new timetables of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain less-laden express or regional trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by two per cent on the day of entry into force of the new timetables compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There are also fewer fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region by eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which can be opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year a total of four billion crowns to pay for the visible losses, which is the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not resort to a price increase from the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only one-day <0xC4><0x8C>D Net tickets and discounted eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka Internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed them, but only spoke about the origin of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa’s history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to play him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains high hopes since it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the ruling black majority.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are currently quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pawn".
Morgan Freeman is, however, in his own words, proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times in order to be able - as they say - to recover his energy, he said at the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he has added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated.In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries to collect two racial groups from a long-divided population during the film, and in the same way that Nelson Mandela in 1995 he dressed in the national jersey of the South African team on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had then won.
To have shown up on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in bringing people back together into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently confided in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to allow the transformer to be consumed, but they reviewed their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and, according to company spokesman Pavla Mandatova, the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not known anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokesperson for North Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire at the processing plant.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport units to distribution units and lines with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint today against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura pointed it out in Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l's Twenty Minutes.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claim that we are making fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slander about the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
He also said he had evidence that no region had complied with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint to be the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for himself.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and lying arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railways for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, said Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today to Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccinations for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay for the following vaccinations ourselves.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance costs 300 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all child vaccination.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the president of the association, said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal disease.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal disease.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerism has its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" however says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest almost 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a renowned illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, the said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied giving such permission, the agency said.
The Labour Party supports the increase in the budget tax.
The ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn fire by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% cap rate on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
The unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that “problems” are looming.
The reduction in Social Security – which will bring in around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the business world, as it is a job tax, according to him, while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect around 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-Budget Report
Social Security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline even further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in the corporate income tax for small companies has been abandoned.
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the top 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a “drop of water in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to split the deficit in two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year — far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, which will launch a new advertising campaign this Thursday warning against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the project to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to come up with a credible plan on how to repay, they added, evading "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the next cuts, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would result in a faster and larger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through increased taxes and decreased spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, claimed that the timing of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional aid is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins,” said Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of this."
FBI Investigates 'American Arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the same men had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are of Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already being monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students had been taken away from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to Amnesty International.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fausse Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer science student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, election loser Mehdi Karroubi claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former inmate who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary are setting up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but has said that the mandate and powers of these bodies are unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee have not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small springboard preceded a 100m-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city sparkling down.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday night party, the snow will be abandoned to melting.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country right now.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen to and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their advocates of a puristic Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the intellectual elite guarding so virulent secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is still usually one millionth of the area required for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future may be out there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not wrong to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes under it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice tributary system, formed by the nets of cold-pressed brackish water.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, maybe it will be our turn.”
Marines, among 6,000 people who laid crowns on Arlington graves
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to drop a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I’d like someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in different sections of Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the United Airlines Flight 93 Victims Memorial site in Shanksville, Penn.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Smothered in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose old graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, pushed into the wet earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears at her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and drove eight hours to gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget that we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. State Department said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husband and wife are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “soft” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government advance through concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Fidel Castro as its leader.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to initiate better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would disassemble a large network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting down a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on YouTube's video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast that have become a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrators.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to gain entry to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
Analysts say potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for 'action' on climate
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets here on Saturday calling for more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists set off some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists have marched through the city, waving signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems the country faces due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I've decided to join the great march -- to get the word out and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous due to his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing masks and black clothing set off several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people were gathering around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that walking may seem harmful or helpful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between the races
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are making much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white Grade 4 (cm1) children in Washington, D.C., have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The achievement gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The mean result of the blanks was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently large.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by Education Group Director Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were being driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equality in District education.
I don’t jump for joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Affiliation), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what scares us is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and early school students who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students than the class,” Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with poorer results in order to reduce the gap.
It’s a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can ensure that their children get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends from it and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition costs are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them towards the entrance of the science building.
"Youpi, really?" said the thinker, when she was told of the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second-generation Hispanic" out of five pursues high school education -- a notable achievement if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, paving the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers studying beaters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- particularly if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (Prep Yourself), it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq’s oil ministry secures deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its troubled infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi oil ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in rehabilitating Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are leaving with a stake in only two of the 10 fields put up for auction.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had placed an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the fields put up for auction in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in opening up the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreat, have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided technical advice, are left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and is leaving with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the oil ministry.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida’s operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a member of Pakistan's civilian intelligence said, speaking on the Miran Shah phone.
Representatives of the authority said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US counter-terrorism officials gave unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's Military Organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had made rapid progress in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure in al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operatives.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the website says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul Resigns
The U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he will step down from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted with allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honour the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- which were thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate U.S. forces’ relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying the UN’s heavy hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has de-dramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that bothers me the most is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of those sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons "because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Energy Agency (EAtom).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts to reach an agreement - in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s tightening up in the face of some of the international community’s proposals that they had actually agreed to in early October prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in on what they had not contemplated, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gat said.
President Obama set December 31 as Iran’s deadline to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "baseless allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking the plane to the rich oil region of Kurdistan to meet with the leaders of the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdistan and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials have quoted Mr. Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.”
We will not abandon you.”
In Aging China, a Change of Direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching them, "Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children" and "One more baby, it's one more grave".
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of Shanghai-registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labor in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive attenuation
Written in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is to this day, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced the abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boy-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of retail regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planners and volunteers to meet couples, to their homes, and to slip prospects under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural Shanghai suburb city say they have seen an increase in requests for couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed, Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the one-child policy to be a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said that she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation company says it more crudely.
For couples working in pairs, middle class, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s have grown up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best nursery."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- returned to the limelight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a UN task force, the text does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, in the current and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representing the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as “the full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. representative for climate negotiations, rejected any discussion that would require industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern said, regretting that the text also does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the US chief negotiator was either lacking “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the US would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are struggling to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said the small island states' actions have "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now unified and are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend in-house meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied over the next week.
The true picture of the rally -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s every day -- guitar-playing activists present nighttime shows mocking countries that they believe are betraying each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will ring at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hopes the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the durations of business trips will be much shorter and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards risk curbing Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also planned that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like it will be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When finished, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour’s journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK’s network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on the London - Birmingham route.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the constraints of space, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be required to run out of high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best one to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the 75,000 GBP loan for the Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a leading Tory member of parliament, has paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his riding.
The leader of the party, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “maintained,” increased his loan by 75,000 GBP to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who oversees the members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland-Melton riding.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orangery.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee into his prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee acquitted him last month of any allegations of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan of his London property to the home of his riding which he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming around <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its requests increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at the time, suggesting that all the increases were aimed at financing the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his post as the head of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him declaring that members of parliament must survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began to have to explain his spending in May after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense bureau that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the expense bureau and Legg."
He added: "There's no problem stealing or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the calendar of the Advent of Brighton
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using as a theme, Christmas songs.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pastries and hot wine served free of charge.
The Noel songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we wait for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came just after a conversation with a few friends, over a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, 100,000 according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that could come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped to make “the political price” of failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, essentially according to them members of the "Blacks Bloc", these ultra-violent factions that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the rally, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night extreme "mined and held in a sitting position despite the cold".
Parliamentary party, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand repair of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can not continue to say: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you’ve never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the altermondialist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "the link between climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, in particular in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "fake"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
This election is a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region of sumptuous landscapes, on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliamentary party, the procession, generally a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without housekeeping, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Bloc", these ultra-violent small groups that had been illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We have in mind the extremist factions, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were spinning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by coach and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand repair of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "lear climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who were to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for action against climate change.

Geo-history emerges reinforced from general high school reform, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were coming out "enhanced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, first graders will each have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L chains cannot remain sub-chains of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals be outraged by the absence of history-geography in the terminal in the technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory education in geography-history in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected representatives.
The Minister, however, added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-Terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow placements during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in National Education".
He also reaffirmed the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge raised Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the Ernest conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish from the school pool.
About twenty speakers are chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes but using charts, told AFP in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he said, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be posted online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The prison watchdog unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to require the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-prisoner (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their debts".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "embarrassing and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "extra hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization ... to bring up discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it has been budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be low, except for management staff with famous function and objective bonuses, Ufap/UNSA deplored, for whom "budget constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until a new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, estimates the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less crowded than others.
But in any case, the account is not there, said the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers “Tricks More Beautiful” Than Those He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, confided to the little screen “poppie” Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule about gifts: “I give nicer things than the ones I get.”
As part of a special show that will air Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they plan to celebrate the New Year’s Eve holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be part of the party.
Santa also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "certainly" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has falsely signed up against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before replying with humor by pointing out the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this hour-long program, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama talked about a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball,” the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated overnight Wednesday through Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of herniated discs suffered in Paris on November 26, its press service said in Paris, saying those injuries had "needed surgery".
However, the singer's press service was reassuring that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the singer's last tour partner, Johnny Hallyday, however, was reportedly put into an artificial coma to avoid "pains and complications".
Only in 48 hours will we have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art world.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured him not to worry about the rocker, who is "a batsman".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of plane ride after such an operation, it's not playable," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had sought reassurance, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "digested".
Camus had also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on by a "small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is abundantly commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulty of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday on a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro 2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a breakthrough.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia on relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who boasted on the world record of 50 m free, of which he owns the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who prevailed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet overtook Croatia’s Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia’s Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to bring down the global mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless prevailed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t really give up on this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola-owned sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, well above his estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century after Jesus Christ, was estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and stunners, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the auction of art of Roman and Egyptian antiquity, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still in progress but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made an element of it from her bathtub in her Parisian mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession of the Maré to power.
There was a shadowy area of about fifty years.
Searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempt to abort Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico said on Thursday that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused bail by the Putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane went back to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migrations.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to step down ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, which he has often spoken about since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government with respect to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which justice accuses him, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress overwhelmingly voted against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing a recovery in activity from both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focused on “half-full glass.”
According to Avalon Partners’ Peter Cardillo, investors focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to widen.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth in the economies of America’s major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against all expectations last week, to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “fell to its lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bill rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the power consume the "Ladies in white"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday consumed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Forty “White Ladies”, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were spit out in the street by supporters of Raul Castro’s government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist said.
Downstairs the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the fist raised, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration was held against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by civilian police, an AFP journalist said.
The police force mounted in civilian vehicles the dissidents who were sprayed by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda serves a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under lock and key.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionary”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills an octogenarian by knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed two-knife gunman killed an octogenarian and injured five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, an hour into the crowd Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the assailant, aged 28, allegedly struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, have learned from police sources and witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then went to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who is in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became unwell and was reportedly hospitalized "in a state of shock," according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter severely.
The scenario was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he was carrying cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forced labour.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, whose head, tried to question the armed man and were wounded with punches, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second 30-year-old man arrived, wounded by a knife.
These are members of the national police who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has referred the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine judicial police department (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out his being taken to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to take him to the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forcemen of this species whose forces increase under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of lawsuits against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the director’s lawyer for the “Pianist,” told three judges in California’s Second District Court of Appeals that there were serious procedural errors at the time of the incident in 1977.
I demand that charges be dropped here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed his sentence with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural foul.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to drop the lawsuits, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also pointed out that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to call for the abandonment of the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer tolerates being harassed with every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his cottage in Gstaad, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, hampered by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the robustness of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November for the second straight month and far more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rose sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan Index.
However, the indices were held back by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest level in two months against the euro, which “pushes down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month’s journey across South Africa, the 112 Miss World nominees are set to cross the final straight on Saturday to fulfill their dream of being voted the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass held for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and had so many experiences!” exclaimed Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not dream of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, emphasizes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” Miss India said with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous Soweto township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (south-west) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I'd be able to approach.
I will definitely be back for the World Cup-2010, get excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive", according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said on Friday on his arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his hospitalized father's bed for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well," Hallyday told reporters as he left the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time.
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very soon" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is attending a school show, an AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible court case to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday had “departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently "left without a drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted on several occasions by the courts, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems in brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very short, said Camus.
The UDF association increases the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardien party, insisting that it no longer be used on any support, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, ruling that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a formal order to the minister and the deputy, telling them not to use the acronym and to pass on the property of the brand to them, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you will propose to your political movement to take back the UDF acronym, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +the UDF of today+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office which insists the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from any media and (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the property of (the) trademark to its legitimate beneficiaries".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they said that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Morin and his friends had "chosen" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The Nouveau Centre therefore has, in their view, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He is profiting scandalously and fraudulently from the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicateness is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for robbing part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to be in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For her part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers's lawyer, Mr Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
“Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who needs to be protected,” he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist with a touch of everything, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tableau.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was due to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ pleadings sometimes turned to grand family unpacking on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer mentioned three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was wary of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to speak to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again found that the complainant was inadmissible, especially since a guardianship judge in recent days refused to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said public prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees adhere to determined "values" from above as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought through technology.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors returns regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders ... a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the center of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes to do, after many detours, as a priority... what it has always done.
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leverages" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental statement: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a way to realize some of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motif Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “in place.”
They thus create a terrain conducive to the concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: ‘Just War’ Worth Praises Right to Obama
The American right welcomed the speech delivered in Oslo the day before by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had broached the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, right-wing hegemon of the Republican Party, to the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over the place, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday worked in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really very good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some side, I found this all-historical speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former president, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give away a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush’s former columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does,” “he spoke like an American president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "gentle, light-hearted and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When you wrap the war in the notion of justice, you can easily justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praiseworthy of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
"Oslo's speech should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
Obama “speak the right speech,” the New York Times said, judging him “both dark and edifying.”
Motorists: Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" in this agreement, after several sessions of negotiations, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early Friday, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
That is, we are going to give the order to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But you can still have some recalcitrants who aren’t happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% revalorization of travel costs, and for the general state-of-the-art of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address, inter alia, the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft amending finance law, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote it "in the same way".
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Mr Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “dupes market” because the 100 million euros “had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next awakening, deplored Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with RATP proposals
Disturbances on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as a Friday meeting on the 2nd day of the strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their premium request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10h00 and 20h00, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force travellers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that “RATP is making efforts to serve department stores.”
The RER A crosses from west to is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at rush hour, and almost no train in off-peak hours, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, as the Franciscans had organized.
Thus, in the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut were arriving or departing from Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not happy to solve a problem while with the road users and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company “was mocking weekend users.”
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a matter of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen into the RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions ask for a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line per million daily travelers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, Heavy Consequence Decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry protests in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “home of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified seven-vote majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Kilic, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to tarnish Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeast Anatolia, where many protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city populated mostly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk claimed that the Justice’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpillage of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the Road Debris and Sandblasting Service (FES) makes it clear that this is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologist, it could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF has a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes high-traffic streets, major thoroughfares, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, in 3 hours maximum time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3am "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the clearing and sanding service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets off to clear the areas deemed dangerous and the crossings as a priority.
As for the cycle paths, the services of the FES are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police use this special service when necessary.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s Science magazine report, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to feature these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was then part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a truly exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not think that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but he points out that it allows to confirm some theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the later tyrannosaur and the velociraptor and from which descend the birds, sauropods, quadrupeds at the long neck, and those which are related to them and the herbivores.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest the Tawa hallae possessed small air sacs in its skull-level bones, as did the birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also had air sacs and a light skeleton, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three great lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent Pangée.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the journal Science Studies says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaur, that lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while practically none can be found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as present-day crocodile ancestors and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, encouraging the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction to which the dinosaurs survived in a random way while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favouredthe development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time was vegetated in the shade: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those in charge of courses at the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino from Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had the buildings occupied by striking students and teachers evacuated after walls and artworks were plastered with graffiti.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention on the part of the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable violation" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee has thus refrained from debates that would be indispensable.
The court officers demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimization of protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary for youth of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Sciences of the Land of Hesse Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU) , she took action and advocated for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Hourde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under Soviet rule, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has a reputation for being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, a place of Frankfurt science – with academic institutes and companies from the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than the “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had a reputation at the time for being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that made the modern rail traffic brake shoe effect because it once took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That is why the main train stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the mainline stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with autorails and driver's cars at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken it away.
The railroad company is on the side because it's the taxpayer who is making the risk charges for the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the section's extension are designed for human trafficking, which was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing the traffic of goods because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junctions and bottlenecks in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987, this line has been built slowly.
It would be really urgent to press here thoroughly on the fungus.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of the international traffic of goods, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgement on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing to the Hessian Administrative Court's ruling on the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had tasked experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement made by the Administrative Tribunal and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations regarding the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project to build the northwest runway of Frankfurt airport would be carried out.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11pm and 5am, as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticizes this delay and tries to pressure the government representative to file an appeal with the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be considered as a total failure to a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "lawyer and robberies".
It takes time to carry out a precise legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its faction on the prohibition of night flights is completely wrong.
U.S. Banks Reimbursement of Assistance
The big American banks, greatly affected by the crisis, are breaking off their ties with the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering reimbursement of the aid received.
Banking institutions thus sought to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to executives as well as the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's cash registers which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, CEO of Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying back investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering acquiring money in the financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin-based ZDF newsroom, was the big favorite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF Superintendent Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against, and Brender's removal by vote was a haphazard but predictable failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to bring Brender back to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the listening rate of the ZDF's information broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is the reason why protests still took place, almost until the vote, stunting the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and who felt Koch's behavior was unconstitutional.
But it won't do any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio station) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became an editor in the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was in charge of the foreign policy department of the ZD and then in charge of the foreign policy department of the ZD.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to seek the removal of political figures from the ZDF's oversight commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skilfully maneuvered the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to sack Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without suspecting him of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great Cleanup in University Studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the burden of examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder have also committed to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master programmes.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less Exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder’s Minister of Education and university rectors have been constantly using the phrase “studiability” in their mouths.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a 30-page document on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop skids, which significantly damaged the studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if one can not avoid this suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and room for manoeuvre necessary to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulations will cover access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing courses.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accrediting agencies throughout the federal territory that rely on accreditation boards set up by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes were not too burdensome and the examination regime not too strict.
In some L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, universities and specialized higher education institutions have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen the offices of pedagogical guidance as well as the offices of examinations and the service of international relations.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and universities have a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, it will also be possible to guarantee the recognition of the transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were voiced.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has announced that he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said on Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls for the right and opportunity for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder provide today's Bachelor students, that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
It is through these words "Arriving in Germany and it's beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner begins, in which he thematizes in bits of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection director in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the artist’s house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
In 1989, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded the German Language Prize jointly with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, “so someone who has not been able to resist attempts to intimidate the Security.”
The poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowliness of a political system based on policing.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He had been able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a nice reserve for the security spies had already written Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of his own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter loans.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and slowed down in the past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of files has rather delayed since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, expressed himself in a very disdain towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many unavoidable questions are associated with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case as is so often the case in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession, suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults in the Champions League
There was the impression that a representative was arriving there, drawn with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportswear manufacturer had spread out his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called the supplier, a plastic gold handbag.
The man, whose bald head attracted attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our fiftieth-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but we had to get back to work tomorrow.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The “big job” is coming up on Sunday.
Here, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that surfaced after the three expeditionary goals of Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Spelling
The eighth final of the Champions League (match going 16/17. + 23./24 February/ return match 9./10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was thus moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so much but that no longer made effects with the healer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, says Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, "in football when there's a new impulse there's sometimes things going on that you would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new leader's working method: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart is in dire need of tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a defense that is totally overtaken and weakened by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later they had a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet crossed the difficult path.
The fact that Heldt didn’t have the heart to party on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made bounce just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would counter, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been suppressed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “largely successful” in retorting Heldt and Lehmann into a chorus – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly verbally and gesturally provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimous consent of the judges, he insisted on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title of world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point-scoring victory over American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not make the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, has had to concede twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the height of 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-wing opponent.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, especially tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a “villainous zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During Friday’s weigh-in, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
This is the fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko once again prevailed in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to abandon without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (the Left) are asking the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper at 8 p.m.).
To be clear, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the NATO report that was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media reports, the aim of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or wounded in the US airstrike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak as soon as possible before the federal parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast are of the opinion that Mrs. Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has in no way influenced the military’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given to Guttenberg regarding the tank truck attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
The two senior officials, however, hinted that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on these allegations and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which was set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can freely indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, awake, experiences the dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case this is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitters of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very often manifested during a schizophrenia psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
Its body is in two dimensions with sculpted colors.
Earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures, bloodied mouths, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Loud, nasty voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, makes a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is loosening.
Let it serve as a lesson, shout the voices in a choir to rip out the tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep desperation.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, the people involved can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and can not act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in your life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes these kinds of cabriolets is always a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved have minimal brain damage.
Neuronal maturation of the brain is thought to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the neuronal system anomaly occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get rid of them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for the past ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are many of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is prone to hallucinations.
According to Kasten, hallucinations consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, the sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A young girl doing everything normal to tell the truth.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn’t dream, she’s sure.
She is awake, hearing and seeing this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even sense his presence momentarily.
It is a pleasant feeling, she finds this young friendly.
“Am I crazy?” she asked sometimes.
But she knows full well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimacing faces or the girl with bloody notches on her arms and legs are before her eyes open or iron.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a fool.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch via the internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or doesn’t have enough stimulation, there’s a good chance they’ll have hallucinations after a while.
I guess since the brain isn't busy enough, make sure there's animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it’s very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of consciousness modification awakened by dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the void of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious part for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels back in time. He sees himself as an old man drunk in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is abducted by a Greek biker who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the mists of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It completely absorbs itself into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he experienced.
Contrary to dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
One can even say that they are much more distinct and intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even on standby.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "can cause a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to join the society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are capable of doing so.
We can't impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to deal with them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President and CEO as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he took over the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a capital bulimia, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I have never had a dream of universal power, said Burda.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of the country's preceptor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding ray, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax through a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy care.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, luminosity or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied décolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona get electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the <0xC2><0xAB> Oficina LIVE ».
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Officina LIVE" (Electric Vehicle Deployment Logistics) will define and coordinate the road map for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transportation of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the deployment of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the electric car deployment.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has a set of complementary projects in progress such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, envisions "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the President of the Government's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (IAP), has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3,000 million.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It has an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
There you will not only find motorcycles and collectible cars, but you will also find in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor Aptitude Test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, fitness tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with cars and collectible motorcycles will also take place on a circuit set up outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporty spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the vehicle finish, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine shut-off and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a true happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3 most in demand are diesel models, those who do not run a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Lane Change Assistant (RVM) which removes the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the audio and light sensor, the blueoth and so on are particularly suitable for the blueto
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with a disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not run many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great dose of satisfaction.
Luxury “first”
L.A. covers the red sensuality carpet played by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at your email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain type of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone's data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and it’s been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
Repeated calls to order from the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon while it doesn't have Wifi) offers this type of rate, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals that allow them to monetize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no hassle.
This is a connected device and you pay at the time of purchase and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifetime access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she, in fact, chose the same to accompany her in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the take-up it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle itself has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study “Fecundity and career of women in Spain”, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not, and the type of employment she is engaged in.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are delaying the entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to push back from union and children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences motherhood, but less the start date of joint life,” explains researcher Margarita Delgado from CSIC.
The level of education is another factor that widens the age gap between women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those who did elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or upper-level studies reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is good too.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, including the universal motto "Because I'm worth it."
The protagonist of Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l, one of the most elegant actresses in the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare the fears or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
Let me give you a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the knife blade that nearly killed him."
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers still let go and always get caught."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the end of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the escape of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm port, / rest after war, / after life, tired death rejoices."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she was also carrying her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told her that Edward VII was sparing her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent was beyond madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if it is not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What was Benet trying to do but get Faulkner to shoot Baroja?
What did He do if He did not seek the glory of this man so that he might serve Him as a pedestal?”
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-stained, saved from SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they put two kicks that left him shrieking.
Our outrage is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack for free a small defenseless animal that, in addition, was on leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energuist who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been moaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district police station, even though we doubt that it is of much use, and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The outrage led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what happens to young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the proper education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only piece of protection to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeler accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it was contributing to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informational nature.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products that are always safer.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Gnavam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be highlighted, as the reference used for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all the vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95 853 have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated, in fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this situation and unlike tourist vehicles, the 2000E purchase aids were of little use.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The Dealers' Association predicts a similar year to the one ending in 2010, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and newly registered light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car parts manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rest on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors to postpone plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has concluded that more time is needed.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, is confident that a decision on the sale of Saab will be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining in importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers started the Boxster S and managed to reduce it to nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to avoid, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the tank of gasoline from 64 to 54 liters, 12 kilos of fuel, from 64 to 54 kilos, and to mounts.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK dual-clutch gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
His behavior can only be described as blameless.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will tell on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Motor sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine roar, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether it's stopping or recovering.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made an act of presence on the whole journey, while on some turns we found ice cream in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
In the end, an ultralight car, the most entertaining to drive and that is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much containment as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or an “It Girl,” it’s a “Bag Girl.”
The Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 on its visit to the arduous terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus at the head of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets of his three points, was the best team in the world.
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same note, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his former home, to increase their break advantage (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as his team's best player, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "less than six" rating already hinted that tonight would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage of the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain up some skillful actions to catch the air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, gave the score-wise to a score-scorer.
Avala's team went out to play the whole thing in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by mistake, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came close at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the head of the Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not scared by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the scale of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter made it possible to make the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two from the leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the interior game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of battle, between the leaders Williamé entered North America.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, cancelling the head of the group.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last outing of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, the three-point baskets of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos proved relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, employment and vehicle ads in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since the app has been running for a week, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data that Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> has from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross annually and a Frenchman, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, while a Spanishman receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
In the same way, a driver receives 34,247 euros in gross annual income in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to leave the diplomatic legation by January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, Brazil’s embassy business manager in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he has to leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile intended to be imposed on him by the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After a rosy few days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty is re-emerged, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents are making decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand into the gears, as the ECB has done, with their one-year award next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are on the rise again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new revision down the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silencing moral hazard advocates, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among world economic policy makers who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, while what should be done is a new decree.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore its place in power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt differentials increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and ours continue to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators oblige most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not add much to their growth.
Again, this seems like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudence is the mother of certainty".
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola President Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n outlined for the press what he had mentioned in front of the subcommittee, eight-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and we will have to increase the power.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW is needed, along with other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the government’s recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company is demanding, has not wanted to attack the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “punctual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has called them.
In any case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans to invest $20 million through 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on motorways and in airports.
Acciona competes for its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at A$1,700 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast, this is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The City Council hopes to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to A$1,700 million (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortia are facing off, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is run by Acciona, Spain’s only smooth-running company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground work.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian company, Razighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger have already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which still remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Multi-millionaire assets
Acciona focuses on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western Toowong Highway to the suburban road at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce the Brisbane trafic.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be opened to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not planned that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers jobs in Hochtief
Australia continues to largely fruitify Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being in charge of the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's ad
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes outside the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it puts on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeat offenders.
An App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone subsidiary has followed the footsteps of other operators and has opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.

Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
The competition has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Allocation
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and equality (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least $7.1 million, and a maximum of $31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive seats.
The previous year's champion pocketed 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer through which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offer to acquire (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and which will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos's shares finished at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential bids and lawsuits from her former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new misappropriations cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV approves Paternina exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The monitoring body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented to be "sufficient" following the amendments applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV clarified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were held and could not in any way be transferred before the closing of the offer, which he indicated was priced by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New Tools for Car Expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a loss are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Compute by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because you have to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image of each model is established on which it is possible to click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure is over 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is saved, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
From the point of view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard accident assessment solution, for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has exited the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of accidents, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it recorded a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she embarked on her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The Solera Group's global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange for $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resistant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increments or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to have these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
