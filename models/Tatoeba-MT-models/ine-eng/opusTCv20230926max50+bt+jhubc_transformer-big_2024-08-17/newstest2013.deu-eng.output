A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, affirming that election fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning strike.
In fact, Republicans’ lawyers have registered only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. is responsible for holding elections in individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have since 2009 announced new laws that make the process of registration or balloting more difficult.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare the right to register as a voter on election day invalid, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a judicial act exists.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a government-issued photo ID.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such an identity card in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who increasingly vote for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general election have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of new voters registered in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they made up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the Whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passing of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws requiring the display of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that when followed up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
Men of African American ancestry also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer disease by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is rather decided to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
Active monitoring is suggested and treatment is offered as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not are determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I recommend that the test be carried out.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine if it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many of them remain completely unsolved.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, uterine, colon, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer,” he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer or colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at this time.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a more likely increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predicament.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked some excitement over the past summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it’s not entirely certain yet that it’s really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely sure.
Still, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let’s look at what it’s all about.
There is a law in this world that is inevitable, which means that two objects cannot exist in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too hard, as you will get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" consisting largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, a bad band of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred – certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons we are not going to treat here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light" which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is “disturbed” at exactly this location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to manifest itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be disturbed by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t — for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not.
For what can all this research be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they serve to review the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately examine any deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major flaws, as it offers no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 60s, the pioneers of lasers in Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent tri-laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that the laser was initially considered more of a “laboratory toy”.
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments that surround the research.
Willard Boyle, for example, developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him with a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in Victor-Gadbois's palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“However, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he reluctantly agrees to let himself be helped with food.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, as this is humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’s home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“It depends on the person’s ability to take a step back,” he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
Patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overcrowded with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation.”
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that you’re putting on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects one last visit from her son, who is from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, you can offer a group of volunteers personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 people.
This is very little considering that one day we will all die.
Here, life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We are helping families and patients alike,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family reunion in the yard and is well supported by his pillows as one approaches his honor, a 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two young children dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care intended to alleviate the suffering of patients who have reached the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Precisely this great inadequacy in health care in Quebec ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care face the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before being accepted to transition to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without any measures being taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients with bites until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
She told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have been asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this desire after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly said that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Society of Home Palliative Care, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in either sporadically or permanently putting the patient to sleep until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but, “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Street construction officials, construction companies, political party funders and Italian mafia specialists tell each day what they know about a great “system” in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic measures were taken,” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement related to the contracts for road construction work in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts,” because some curbed their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing off the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was set up in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-troupe", which since 2009 has made the "canalization cartel" of Montreal more restrained in the artificial inflating of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers of the Montreal road construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly charged.
The latter has attracted attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the Montreal contracts to a Mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the cost of which has been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of $ 736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he could pay.
Other officials at the Road Construction Office have admitted that they were lubricating themselves by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, from 2010 she opposed the sale of a community plot that was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says, she is “drawing on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system underrun by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigation unit and oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all he is concerned about the role of the "mandates who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% share of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is just a weak slap in the face of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and funding the parties: "We can't go deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, it’s even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I'm not bursting with enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s newcomers are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the forehead and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti pays respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with some great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we are waiting in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the return match of the eighth final as a home game.
Can PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, it’s really important for us to get rid of this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to take the win away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something to blame, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the finals for two seasons and has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
All the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some game time.
I’ve seen things there that I’ve grown stronger from.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blues".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behavior.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months at the top of the "Blues"?
It has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don’t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw forced in Spain on October 16th a kick-off game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes even trade back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the public accounts’ ledger distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for fraud twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred million, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others, such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-final sale" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, the company that converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the merchants, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be “photographed and recognized” by a phone, Pierre Noizat says, assuring that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report envisages reassessing the various risks that are now considered high in the event of the success of this currency.
We've moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who deny an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was duly carried out.
The convoys of trucks and tanks flown by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflows into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the fighting of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from massive American subcontracting.
They were in disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; the TV with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command she will be standing be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization like the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that has been ravaged by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been required.
Rumors have been spread that Afghanistan has immense land resources.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
No mining is possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls’ and boys’ high schools, the French Institute at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was suspended in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to gain the "hearts and minds open to help".
These works, which required numerous local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are often very harsh in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to get rid of the insurgency led by foreign groups, which they claim is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the Breaking Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game from President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever about the constitutional declaration that gives it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now relied for almost two years on a provisional, multiple-changed text, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the law with his feet".
On the side of his supporters, he assures that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to forgo their plan to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it’s also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
After confirming in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
When an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian people with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited power", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt they had not been able to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to reach the decision-making power, 11 people, deputy members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, found it amusing that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Sacredness" is echoed by the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda attack.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which confers an advisory function on Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, since "the people who are asked to comment have not been elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defense budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The actual existence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land brings together the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
bowing down before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the silence of the storm and the catch of fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Here, believers follow the Way of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notebooks with wishes, which then go into fulfillment.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 AD for his family.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
One of them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally declined.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children’s Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is total darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21°C and the air warms up to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and healing mud, as well as for treating skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to soothe tired nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
This is the secret of Tel Aviv’s old town, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all those who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Highlights for tourists
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is better to take with you not in euros, but in dollars that can be easily exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can usually get there by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed railway and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats, who comfortably and unobtrusively stray through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like lively places and do not say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates.
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left in the home.
On December 1st, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers over time, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
In doing so, one must not only take language tests, but also take tests into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the receipt and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their educational certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, Problematics and Protection of Rights
All the examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the following question in the press before the law came into force: What does it actually mean?
What changes does the regulation make in having to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
First of all, the migration authority’s spokesman said, the aim is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency’s office in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, who will put him under the guise of help in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of unequal months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At home, you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken away and you will not receive the promised salary,” confirmed Tolib Schwaripov, head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik Migration Authority.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only immigrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, then there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for unauthorized persons is prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this then leads to cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Don't be afraid of the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for free: every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself from the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates can not be bought easily, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are reacting to the recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the atrocity of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
Police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - ask the authorities to distance themselves from "meaningless aggravations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from using the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from the police’s weapons chambers and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps, there were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and, therefore, are slinging weapons at hand on the black market, such as in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” the former military official explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of the “guilt of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work,” the report said.
According to the data of the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store who doesn’t want to be named assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one, as they are out of date.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain the supply in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, such as a TT pistol, is purchased via a ferry.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
"Of course, the police know everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested I come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I only found out the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who can tell that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m even getting some banging about an acquaintance I trust right now.
He also gives me the rings just because he knows I'm not screwing him up.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
In the mid-1990s, former military official Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military official recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but go with the seller to the forest, and there we set up a target.
“I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed and there are no personal meetings.
"You just need the right amount of money," the ad on the website says, "Buy a gun or rifle."
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", asks user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are flocking to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former member of the military Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The managers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislow, a spokesman for the NGO Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also leave empty and come behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are flocking to the service.
“People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices from 100 to 900 US dollars can be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons warehouses by mid-range guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons throughout Russia in the period from January to October 2011 decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four U.S. youths at some point sits behind the checkout desk of Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food employees, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, where U.S. sales were held, attracting millions of customers, sometimes resulting in handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and, along with unions and left-wing activists, struck down branches of the chain whose target group is low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, show that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they’re donating now for wages.
If Walmart were to completely shift the pay increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, that would be an increase of just $12.39 per year compared to today.
Advocates of Walmart are satisfied that there were only protests in nine states, and these did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cashiers executed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees were laid off and the protest was merely “another PR trick” by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city and therefore do not exist so far), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too much, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city deserves less.
How it is possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the youths were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to make up for this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began Thursday morning at 6:30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and from reprimanding or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day also in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a gathering at lunchtime in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately outsmarted so far"
The topic of augmented reality, popular among followers of modern technologies, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the Interactive 3D Technologies Group at Microsoft’s lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual free spaces.
- Please briefly describe which research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these shady virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all those around you about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short, rather than with exaggerating gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to supply you with this sprinkler?
They say it and point it out at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that allow us to more accurately capture people’s reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is it lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps, especially for gestures, are not enough.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera attachments to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the road, but I think the following: The best option would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in this lies their strength (privates can only be seen), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don’t feel anything at all.
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the augmented reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection medium.
She feels the pressure very well!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" something hand-holding, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still as weak as someone breathing over the handballs.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
It makes you think that it senses what it should feel when it is just seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to contend with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outsmarted, and we still have many years of hard work ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Personal taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the shortlist.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who is sometimes found at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street, he charms his fellow citizens with a smile in his face and makes them feel good.
Recently, he grabbed a camera and became a camera player in St. Petersburg, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistry, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace of Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters then came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from this arose "Pushkinskaya 10", and then only once was the end.
It draws me to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except literature.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how String came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Strings and his friends sang simple songs for the play-back, wore tight jerseys and they also included the now-popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
This is where our staff and regulars went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "Persons of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with this I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I'm going to have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by disguise.
- We recently saw you in the role of the urban organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Michailow will be attended by several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything is destroyed.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, which hung in a row even with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumerism has no culture at all, it’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked from the way, because it requires higher-ranking experts who correctly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg to you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
This is much less with us.
Art has to be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board are searching for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"It's Mars and Venus," says astronomer Vladimir Surdin of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first discussed the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas grown in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chick has to stop; it has to be able to stand on its feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the laboratory at the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks squandered themselves wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicks hatch and then we stopped the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says of the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent into space fertilized.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," Sychev said.
After landing, the space rats were given offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our gulls flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive spaceflight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
However, there is still a risk.
We only have a very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Although adults find water to be pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness that life in the land rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother’s womb for about 9 months in the amniotic fluid, and the fact that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim just 2 weeks pass.
“This is not enough time to forget something,” says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn baby, weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form very quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze the child out.
All right, let's get around the birthing aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth's pull, the organism cannot form the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of elementary importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unsuitable person,” says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the inhabitants of Earth in their spaceships go to a distant planet, which becomes the home for their descendants born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the Black System Failed by Guilt of Politics
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but they fall behind in their application.
In the conversation for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> kontroln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0xBA><0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, says this.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly – and I don’t think that’s the case with us,” Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, interfere with its activities," states Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel examination, which we started with about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a matter of European legislation setting out how public contracts are to be handled, which is what national legislation is based on, and, finally, the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws in our country may even be a little more "strict and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again, and one also has to deal with the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project help you? What does this project mean for you?
It is precisely such a joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of the laws and the reduction and elimination of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economical means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we burden the system in this way only with excessive "paper clutter", and those who seek gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a college, which is formed only slightly differently.
Competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are also these courts in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities in our country, are subject to the control of the state accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without concrete information; nevertheless, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, although it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better at everything.
Is it because the testers are better?
That is not certain, but as I said: I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with cooperating with our authority, would they?
As for the Czech legislation, what was the significance for your authority of the renewal of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novella is only in force for a short time, it does not have an effect on our examinations so far.
Since our checks take place at a later date, there is a certain delay to be expected.
So far, we are more likely to have an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of uneconomicity" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts reviewed and analyzed - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds have changed, the conditions for certain types of changes have changed.
Do you see the passing of this law as more positive, or will the system be burdened with further red tape?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to an audit are accountable to the bearer (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the procurement law is tantamount to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to tighten the law?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let us say which path is not objective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not illuminate the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, interfere with its work.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do it as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to defects in form.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there is occasional icing, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly easy to drive, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary the roads were easy to drive this morning, sometimes snow and ice smoothness prevailed.
Temperatures drop to -5 to -10°C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin blanket of snow remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
According to the district road watch, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes required and smooth.
All transport routes of the second and third classes of roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, sections of snow remains required or extended.
In particular in the higher positions, increased attention is therefore required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is danger due to ice-smoothness, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended snow layer on the roads, the road and highway management informs on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice cream can be enjoyed on second and third class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended snow layer lies in elevations on the streets of the districts Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia, it is mostly sunny or hot today, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
Temperatures range from -3 to +1 °C, with high winds.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well tradable today, but local attention is paid, and the driving style is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
As it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, the roads can get icy.
Local fog is also to be expected, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but the road championships recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131st kilometers.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice cream can be obtained in sections.
The roads of the second and third class of roads are damp, and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, snowmakers have to count on drivers who are travelling in the direction of the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snowballs remain on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nocturnal snow drift forced the road championships to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk about 3 cm of new snow fell, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the highways are usually freely traversable.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, snow remains in the highlands.
On the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Her colleagues in the district of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k also had to go out at night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet up to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads here are still damp.
Bezirk <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In North Bohemia, the road championships report several road sections that are not easily traversable.
In addition to several places with snow or icy smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is blocked, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero at lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads, but no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Midlands, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD> area.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main roads and from the I/13 road on the border of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec districts.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was blocked due to branches pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more likely to make fun of it and say that we’re the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, i.e. 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Where did this idea come from?
Initially probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once give this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world entitled "The end of the world falls out".
Already today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and to the very end, provided that everything works out and the world does not end...
The anthem is to be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live on Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoying it.
What purpose will the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will create our own building, which we will then move into with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
By what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to create a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> appear.
Everything else can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad, you will have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than in our country, we witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for the disabled, where it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to travel alone in the city center.
It is not even self-evident that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we hang out in...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a tutor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our presenter, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, used to say, something gets out of control (laughs).
The band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and it is not visible to the outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is carefully considered and only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live a full life and develop, if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, it is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
This is, in my opinion, completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and if they then find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly fades.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Those who have the will and the desire to participate are always welcome to join us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted global downturn, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fallt aus" by the band The Tap Tap sounds.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the provision of a multifunctional educational centre suitable for the disabled, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs CZK 400, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available for pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the ESA member countries, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this space agency, making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, and this did not always lead to understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to the Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
<0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Entrance to the Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was recognized, among other things, by naming one of the craters on the far side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway train was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to launch or to brake the draisines.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled guns.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down, it is clear that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, Rohozinski's design of a photoelectric hunting missile appeared in the press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on spaceflight were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautzyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles on space travel are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) sought to join the International Space Federation (ISS), founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became the Deputy Chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not quite weigh 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert, flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a carrying capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Aeronautical Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland also joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
As part of the Intercosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on non-profit work.
This decision gave rise to a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrestrained financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wage), price tensions arise.
This term is to be understood as referring to a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to compete by importing favourable goods in economic competition by "undercutting" the competition in order to gain a larger market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their manufacturing abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high labor costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without regard for the social consequences to private capital.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, for some years now, there have been public food outlets for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to work for a hunger wage on the fringes of society, hoping that at some point private investment will be made.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from.
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital stays out of it altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim, until further notice, that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that the planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation in which practically everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a State Ministry entrusts private law firms closely linked to industry with the drafting of bills.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Evidently, liberal democracies are now rapidly falling into a situation as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long since been understood to be in disarray, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against lubricating money, through unlawful easing of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unchecked, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state as a result of this decline had no consul for eight months" ... "But they were already really beginning to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a man's self-rule, and that a strong one would be elected"
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already drawing to a close.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are facing the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are already witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises out of violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus reads, "...so that we may not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while others refer to the Palestinians as terrorists; others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs and refer to the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and who is the victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; in the end, today’s residents of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
My aim is to open the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, the eyes of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In any era, we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We have to admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out a special one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I do not know if anyone else is above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with high-crime acts, in the background of which there was always the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or arming themselves on these (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi there were only four left under the central bank in Russia).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e., state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global lust for power led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars in 1859–1871 by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular should be broken, and the third war is not intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury and would also not deprive the world of so many resources).
The method by which the group of wealthiest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see establishment of the Fed, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the assassination of the Habsburg Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militaryly and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make it easier to start a World War II, the bankers had to create a latent conflict situation through the policy of the bankers, by also placing Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby creating the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had only to subjugate the Germans to a sufficiently strong leader, who called the culprits a simple solution.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible on the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain that the international bankers had initially kept him on, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like in World War II, will become the victim in the front line of the struggle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their desire for global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, exclusively elect their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-influenced, world-wide control over only 20% of the world's politicians loyal to the international bankers, who could do anything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict.
David Rockefeller once said, “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocracy.
A world in which every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it causes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the bondmen, to give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no man may buy or sell, but they have the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had guarded the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt to free the hostages only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations had been brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages brought home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran; in doing so, they were helped by an extravagant story to conceal their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited the country’s filming location for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by "Exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and slightly exaggerated, therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official floors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable start to his career with this film.
From a smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime drama No Child’s Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City of No Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it’s Affleck’s first film, not in the director’s native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that lifted the previous films of this director from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is “played” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect even in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes he helps the reality a little - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some of its traction and is a film that can be followed with some interest and at the same time the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70’s can be tasted.
However, it only arouses enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in some way today, and as proof of how far-fetched the notions of the almighty and all-knowing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls a survey on the most absurd bank charges, this year decided to organize the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
“Further incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels that are harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken coops, because of which eggs became essential this year.
In the past, criticism has also garnered the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on sales of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industry lobby, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks, for example, even with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests also insisted that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curve anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it only harmonises the non-uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The rules on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to balloons on sale must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using market stalls.
There are also curious ideas at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes up an official position in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a member country in addition to the aforementioned absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we don't have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU,” declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palace.
Finally, the European Commission welcomed the Czech Republic to the point where it organised a call for tenders for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for applications for grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), in particular it should be funds for the establishment of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve, in the opinion of some experts, more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by individual member states during the budget negotiations.
The fact that, like other member countries in Brussels, the Czech Republic has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products, and this fight does not always win.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké var<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", the Inland Rum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for products made of sugar cane distillate, not for products made of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, L<0xC3><0xBC>beck marzipan or Parma ham now also appear in the company of Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice rolls can be breasted.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If in our country everything would work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves are running around freely, while people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and unbiased about it, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Do you not turn your back on your constituents?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of President if I am elected to the Senate.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we put down anyone who wants to change anything.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle has been accepted with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked hard to ensure that the travel guide remains a free business, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics – if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party leader, I have a far greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country from any party without any partisan thinking and party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person on the right or left in politics?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you draw up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach it.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals that I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have keywords.
In the long term, this will not go far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the defendants might have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality who points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I make it clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things for myself; and if it doesn’t work out, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I am not achieving anything on my own; that is why I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they want to run for the Senate.
I spoke to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who uncovered the fraud in the light fuel oil trade.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have elected such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few more million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I have always liked James Bond, how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live on senatorial salary alone, so I couldn’t fund my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to get your income?
Didn't you say you'd go back to those activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially withdrawn my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live by something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
As president, however, I would stop my activities altogether.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday issue of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - with the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries today voluntarily, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town that hardly needs to be visited at the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-strong community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to come from there!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam’s architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical constructions, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still squinting and shivering, the cheeky Maas piled his exquisite contribution of size into a pyramid and ended his action-packed speech with the words: "Love the city community!"
So this is it, my proposal for the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain is being spilt up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project has also been nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfathomably ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would have tended to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: B<0xC3><0xBC>chereldorado under cheese bells.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true space and reading delights open with the walking climb of the topography.
The all-glass interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Usually the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and sculpted the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg is skillfully used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes bracing, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even inanimate architects and civil engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and fields as a root substrate.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after that it is ripe for the blocking waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, the Literature Café not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inwards.
The wide wooden awnings, which stand transversely to the glass facade, serve as shading and capture much of the sun’s radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the first time, this will fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully stocked - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-baked library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then there was Berlin.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
That’s because it is shifting its foreign policy away from a policy that was managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans therefore find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still tapping into their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German reflections.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for this.
Because it does signal that as an international player it needs to be taken seriously and its interests taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It needs to be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is continuously decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is unpleasant and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they are getting it right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing Law Firm, which specializes in property infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their brands.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in violation of intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he is against the fact that Chinese companies officially receive the right from the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not at fault.
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is being watered down, the solo attitude is disappearing, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially with expensive flagship products.
According to market research firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long period of time the contested name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he’ll even have to pay the plagiarist money because he hurt his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not at fault.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
In the past year, however, the "emergency situation in the work process has returned to normal".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
That’s a record, and it means China is leading the list of new applications around the world for the 10th time in a row.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected in fees.
Simplify this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To address this, there is a multiple cost, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
You yourself have failed because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark office rejected the Municher’s objection.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hellishly careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be counted, the company archive had to go through even a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to sweep back to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long since been abandoned by the Group, despite the fact that it was able to avoid registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to his brand drama in the last act, then the opposite party would probably have to pay license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDSwaisen are happy about it.
The history of a connection that far exceeds 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell up - old, bass, tenor and soprano - intrude, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which is estimated by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 people living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Voices for Africa Paten association has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser on Zulu.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: in southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they died of the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what the whole of Swaziland is sick of is small: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying by mid-30s is not a rarity.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a high school diploma, there is no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Fillets and scabs are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), tripper, and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless, about 20 percent of HIV new infections are accounted for by this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1,697 illnesses in 2001 to 3,698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late effects can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gagen, which the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans sleep well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms show up to school on time every day.
Anyone who has no one else comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had to have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best to keep it silent.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There are free condoms in every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through southern Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also toppled some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometer air line to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, you can also see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as evidenced by three studies published in the journal Science on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the planet’s permanently shadowed region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: small eye-holes in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of "planet" in 2006.
This image of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are identified as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pinkish "newborns" in the star circle.
This star-forming region - called W5 unromantic by scientists - has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star threw out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors become more noticeable.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula in this infrared photo faces the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to an earthly continent brought this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloration.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), as dark dust stripes triple the glowing heart of the star's birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race against each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a fragment of the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, picked up the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
The Star Cradle always produces new Youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected with the rosette nebula, continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was not until shortly after the Big Bang that hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown ever larger – and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed at its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
This is because, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to cover a full 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks up at the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been supplying images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drinking butter every day - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where the 97-year-old is still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where the 97-year-old is still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus strolls down the winding road, past densely forested hills, rippling rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts too much Soviet-era architecture, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, it is too difficult to get to the capital of Azerbaijan Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented human being, who turned 122 years old, Muslumov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to a daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Musl<0xC3><0xBC>mov settle for a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard from the highly-paid in Central Asia.
"There are also many elderly people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men living."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific proof of age should be kept, especially since there was no register of persons.
Freshly melted butter every day
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are so many high-wage people living here in the south?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
But that the high-calorie diet of the Talyschen should be so healthy, the meat, bread and above all dairy products love and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem particularly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a buttercup, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom are long-time grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
Guests can prepare tea in the kitchen, which is served in typical Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in line and limb, under her headcloth she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation that ruled his country like a dictator hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no misery among the ancients of Azerbaijan.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grey son is right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.

"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For they are all, hitherto hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile by the graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, as Mohammed Morsi almost apologetically said, temporarily curtailed the Constitutional Court’s powers and expanded its powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be disenfranchised?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were whipped up by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nocturnal, 15-hour parforcerite, are partly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What is meant by "principles"?
That was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the muddled wording and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiance in all of Sunni Islam, must be drawn.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the disqualification of the judiciary.
Much of the drafting is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress opposition figures.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as the draft states, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morality and values".
This is legally so vaguely formulated that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
A matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft that Morsi has for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamists’ overpowering power.
Tens of thousands rallied on Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday evening, vowing to bring down the charter before it can enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution was part of "the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, he accused Mursis supporters of wanting to lead a "pusch against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew up for counter-demonstration, but for precautionary reasons not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi, "Cleanse the land!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have evoked conditions similar to civil war.
Obviously, Mursi’s supporters didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone on until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state led to the resignation of the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto disenfranchising it," Saeda lamented.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, who look at the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, “You carry a monster that you can no longer control.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most disgusting fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty stinky fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
You have to imagine the smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There’s snow here, spectacular landscapes – and that persistent smell in the air that just doesn’t want to go away.
Rakfisk is salt-coated trout, which – depending on how stinky you would like your fish to be – is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this speciality, which is now really very impressive.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but as a so-called "rakfisk general" also organizes the festival.
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“People like the aquavit more than the rakfisk,” says Havard.
The spirits can suppress the smell.
I'll take a few bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it is not bad - like sushi, for example, which has a rather long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities yet and fish were soaked in air-tight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and - no doubt with senses dampened by alcohol - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smoky, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often make it to the world press, and most people don’t seem to mind.
Anders Breivik's name is still hated here - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for Norway’s wealth today has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and pungent blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very flattering, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's revenues will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money they didn’t have at all, Norway held its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and prepare for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat bites me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is again on the menu.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict smell of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico’s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
At the moment, the traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-closing city, but on Monday a steel ring was erected that shuts down several major transport routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Prior to joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, expansive part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left on a patch of brachland near a large landfill.
During the time of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nieto believe that he at least did not adequately address the problem of female murder during his term in office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the sternum had already been inserted.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a speaker, a troublemaker, a troublemaker.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidency on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been victimized by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope that as president he is the way he was as governor," says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Prosecutor's Office Says Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Abuse
Prosecutors deny Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning’s time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The freedman of the U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office on Friday tried to determine that Army-retarded Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain in military terms about the alleged abuse he suffered.
During a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense application to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh detention period - Manning had stated that he had contemplated suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been serving time from July 2010 to April 2011 under heightened conditions of detention.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote ‘No Problems’ (after discussing the concerns), and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade his observational status to “prevent injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status – which is one level under the threat of suicide – to his own and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries ... in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had contemplated suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious once due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or to the outside world had been burdensome.
“My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
He always had to sleep with light entering his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could not see his face, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned a charge he had leveled in his testimony on Thursday — that he had slept naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
In the interview on Friday, Manning said he had closed the door from an order of his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before and had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges deemed to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners held under the highest security safeguards in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmission of national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control, when recklessness was spreading in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extrangeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called “Mexicans” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t let go of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is a reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war on the drug cartel, even though he did not give details.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under pre-emptive gun control to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complaints about how the Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge really lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, one person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated northward.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools, and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take it badly.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary “ambassadors” for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in the face of unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge against how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual blame, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed — and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were struck.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-fought on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although its group itself had to record large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being driven into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Gleeful Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on Israel’s southern flank has permanently changed the region’s balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is biased against Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers – not least thanks to the containment facilities that are being carried out in the West Bank and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have always been declared to be under international law.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why are these sneaky Palestinians also slandering and leaving them their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they, like their fellow Gazans, fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab spring could give them a dash through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense state of Israel is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in restoring their economy.
That pragmatic President Morsi is teaming up with Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire could be a promising sign — and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tacit steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Suppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel secedes for security purposes.
The hope, small for the near future, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more leverage to enforce this solution.
Egypt, along with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by land swaps and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vested interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Laws for Uniform Cigarette Packaging Come into Force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical small font will be from next Saturday.
Australia has introduced the most stringent tobacco packaging regulations in the world.
The Australian government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco use.
In doing so, the government is looking at studies that have shown that people who haven’t started smoking at age 26 are 99% likely to stop smoking even after that.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only slightly affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that with the laws, the black market trade would be favored, which would lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that demand for cigarette butts and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies filed their lawsuits with the Supreme Court of Australia two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from television advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop exhibiting cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Anyone who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to promote their products doesn’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in testimonials about brands written by “very normal people.”
One has to ask the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it – or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on marketing rather than dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries conducts greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to refill its shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he added visibly horribly.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think a few thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking — even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are starting to see boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are staring at one or the other screen almost constantly these days, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it".
Boring differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a “disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is just passing slowly.”
Boring can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom in the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which a magisterium listens to a person.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who watched the hard-of-hearing television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or grueling task can lead to distracting boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you perform a monotonous activity - "such as looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that ticks and ticks, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wander around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a buzzing speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boring chance scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like “Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – particularly when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty laid-back bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages have increased or decreased in terms of boredom.
However, he is sure that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and lapse into gambling or drugs to relieve them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, but in the long term, these become volatile again.
So, if you give your bored child an iPad, it can take it away from boredom, but it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to converse, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we view them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even outside of the constant activity and technology entanglement.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise is muted.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands in Southeastern Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in this state: possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was sued for possession of drugs and drug supplies – cavalier crimes, each of which carries a $100 penalty – and received a court order.
"We were treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which is allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced they are continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Police Chief, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well-suited for orientation,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the State of Washington’s liquor regulator.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6th, and thus also forms the end point of a gray area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time – such as how to agree the state’s requirement of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a licensed cannabis business location than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to employees in Aurora stating that the attorney general would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that police would not seek "immediate" criminal charges for those offenses.
Chief Oates added that police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to induce consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to be held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged with other crimes as well.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time of the act," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even divisive in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, are no longer showing adults for possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending ownership proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state fueled a deep rift among local officials over the big green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver-based attorney who represents marijuana offenders in court and acts as a spokesperson for the national organization for marijuana enforcement reform.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for it that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several eye-popping arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, they will likely struggle to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We judge ourselves by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the world’s greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my admission to Worcester College in the late 1980s—where I had intended to study history—I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I would have gone because I would have had a problem with co-workers having sex in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson declared that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I was subjected to systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate-rights students is suffering similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same level of equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They are demanding a seat on their college’s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among other things, it featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Union of Oxford University, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver suit and silver-plated walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as “sinful scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees.”
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Student Union at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the application for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says she has observed a growing rejection of students' rights by JCR members.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members,” she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even alarmed Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students got to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what would happen in the future.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with joy in it.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come next.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I tripped on it.
Pitt was a small man with a cake dough-like face, and quite polite.
“Are Thatcher supporters refusing to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students nodded.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging back.
That night I was sitting in college alone at dinner when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Union.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics, and economics who had ironically attended the conservative Eton College said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared their opinions.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were before me stretched before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of self-denial and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-Determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said softly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends have always shown impeccable manners.
His wet eyes were dizzy.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given in to the pressure and disavowed his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another storyteller had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Even though I secretly fell out of shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a “brainwashing” and called them “old bastards.”
The relief only lasted a short time.
It was my father who struck the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bunnies gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a whiny slut.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses have been assembled, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always had a fascination for the pungent and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most distinguished aristocracy, ranging from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At the very least, they don’t stand out on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" who began her career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of sensuality, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long walkway, the Ka<0xC3><0xBC>lder Mann<0xC3><0xB6>ssigt: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audience" who wears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Arist Kennedy wore for her with Jackie Kennedy.
In this audience from fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” added the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin’s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that pays homage to his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzes" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years tarnished with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calm, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2,386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at turtle pace, maintaining balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and (never better said) its workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
This then sells them for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
For each track, he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with fieldwork.
“The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought them to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left its first traces on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a porter.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color glows bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought himself from his own money.
About 400 carriers load themselves on the crater floor with baskets of sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tortoise.
“This work is for the animals and not for the people,” protested Madrusin, a staunch, 42-year-old supporter who has been working at the Kawah Ijen school for three decades.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are stuck in the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the cheeks.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest also works as a sulphur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: the one that works as a human load cell on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame having no children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an ad for mint candies, but nevertheless – or precisely because of it – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper's song, which uses local sayings such as "Sliding will put a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising company that shot the video, is hopeful that the ad will come to the attention of the problem in a fun way.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were breeding, we were the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (quick flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, like compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But so far, everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 — also known as the replacement rate — was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, said this was due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities in addition to getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the postponement of marriage and childbirth, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely disguised xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they may deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out in days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously hampered if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have a big impact.
“People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
Children can have others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress and cost of ownership and education as reasons why they can’t have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
Offline Private Offline is online private
Privacy Policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when applying it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the importance of “private” on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not from me, or from someone who makes a fool of themselves,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just charging them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is harassing me or demanding it from me, I’ll just remove them from my user account,” he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experience that is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, it explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unsympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe one out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orientate children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, where we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it.”
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is, is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things that you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of yourself, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission when you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that you need to trade online as you do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring (disambiguation)
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Completion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was supposed to be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the 6th Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but later declared that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government at some time.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, with brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulating among the journalists was received by the press representatives of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which brought out the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.
After that, Peru’s presidential office sent the media an email with the “concluding statement” of the summit, but it was Humala’s declaration and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been previously announced, was not published, despite pressing requests from the press.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements and submits to international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, filed a lawsuit against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, for which we extend the decisions on residency rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant moves, but serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connectivity in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, located on the transverse axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, said that he expected a meeting with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Maybe I'll meet tomorrow (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency during the period of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would propel the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reshaping of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had demanded that he be questioned on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisprudence allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be affected.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
However, there was a risk that he would suffer physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at Ecuador's embassy in London was the granting of a free letter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it was in the interests of the UK, Sweden and the European Union.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is conducting a series of proceedings at various European courts,” he explained.
And "if the UK grants this release tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at Ecuador’s embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence allows and was done in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that discourages free speech."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and blackmail profit,” he said.
In this sense, he welcomed the fact that Ecuador will no longer be dominated by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that in a re-election he would "deepen the revolution to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the body "must remain hard and not admit to opportunism and no legally disguised coup d'état" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime statehood of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
Regarding the possibility of him running for the next presidential election in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“It is decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It in no way means a relapse into President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS-related death today is too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb went off," he says of the moment he was diagnosed, which the doctor tried to "weaken down" without any recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with a quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient receiving treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, stating in this information that he was informed that
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists have concluded from CD4 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater chances of getting a drug are not limited to:
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, in this sense "can easily become 75 years old as long as he is under control," explained this specialist.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have been diagnosed with AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infectious state, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why massive recognition tests must be offered to all persons who need them."
This proposal was approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Preventi<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (the State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who had had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the sole reason that he had made a friend of his age, who had already trusted him.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they are going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” counts Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the global AIDS day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this, “the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were issued individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need that?" is a common mock question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not just behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public restrooms of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like this; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV cases.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of Vitro Group’s liabilities that was achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws have no validity in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bancarrotas District Court for the Northern District of Texas on June 15 results in the Mexican companies being helpless in the confiscation of their property beyond the River Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door for Mexico’s largest glassmaker to appeal to the United States Supreme Court over three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings concern the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a conciliator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that, without the votes of the companies, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate held by the Vitro branches with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed among companies in the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy).
It is also true that, after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds of the vultures such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have gone 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family objects to the same court of appeal, so that the vote takes place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare objection is filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the Court set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and which points out that it had been signed into law strictly to the Chapters of the 15 Agreement signed by the two countries.
In addition, it is noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-legged carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican air traffic unions against the former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Union of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The application filed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the General Administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (Professional Hotel Management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is Surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to comply with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had ignored the possibility because it considered them a violation of free expression in social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, Homex is bringing over 500 million pesos of stock exchange certificates to the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Qu<0xC3><0xA1>lity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competitive, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of the sport for 6 years, whether it was as a lower-class player, a player of the first national league, a proxy and a leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
"Throughout my life, I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora's home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed the most, because I’ve been part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, “I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best pitchers.
I still remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would have taken care of another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, had it not been for this Canadian referee who had us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a fight as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) again with that team, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter as a replacement for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as much as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of “Dallas.”
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Charming Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971–72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film works included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their environment was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.", which was supposed to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in betting houses.
The series reached a record number of viewers at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers turning "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sly businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) inducted.
“I know what to put on J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world, and it remains in our hearts to those who have been lucky enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on stage in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could harm someone or affect them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmagedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple designation “The End of the World.”
"We are not taking up in 2012 so that we always retain the option of being able to hold the course again in case the world does not go down," Restall said.
Despite the "precedented demise", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working into the night, where the world is supposedly ending," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cult or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, says he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class where this is taught,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed — let alone a professor — said they believed in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Other places, people don’t think that way,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the “end of the world”.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception by a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
