Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe
He's a charismatic.
At the Masses of Saints for liberation and healing, which he performed, the crowds gather.
He was twelve years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscans, others are experiencing this.
On the Mass celebrated by Fr. Vitko, Saints for liberation and healing, crowds gather
He was once visited by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Wittko prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprised doctors said: “The operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying with happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
Spiritually, the Creator’s extraordinary actions began to be experienced as a teenager.
In his dreams, the souls of the Purgatory came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and impelled to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human characteristics and began to take on the appearance of an animal,” he says.
The invisible force carried him up, he could not extract his voice.
He felt that he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to the human form,” he says.
He didn’t tell anyone about these strange experiences.
His vocation matured in him.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In the sermons, he not only wanted to talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease take part in the healing masses organized by Father Witko.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team of Kolping FRAC earned the credit of the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Yaroslavians in such a personal list, which they presented with the Countesses, have no chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
It was a good match with Darth Bogorya.
The team is still missing, named after the team's leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the celebration would reach the third in a row triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win with such thousands as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw.
Both in the face of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class unto itself.
After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel G<0xC3><0xB3>rak after an emotional, five-hundred-year battle – Pavla Sirucka.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
One could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional research for seniors.
Why? !
According to the announcements of Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive studies for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.
In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly chosen.
“The above actions may even affect the detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in access to NFZ services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive result of the study,” it said.
The decision of the ministry does not understand the president of the capital.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to lead to a situation in which prevention can be done more quickly.
All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafa<0xC5><0x82> Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine running specialists saying, ‘Don’t worry, there will be longer lines at the doctor’s, and if such specialists advise the government, then I’m not surprised that the health service is in such a state,’” he added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all previous agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break any agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tries to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu’s announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, which will rise up, begins to implement this plan, we will annul all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will completely and completely reject the whole plan,” Abbas said, under pressure.
“It is our duty to defend all of our rights with every possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the enforcement of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” said the president of the Palestinian Authority, who made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, has again received the mission of forming a government after the September 17 elections.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of U.S.-sponsored peace agreements.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold a Palestinian general election.
The last one took place in 2006.
“After returning to the country, I will call for local elections in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” he said.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to the exercise of the powers vested in the "full members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech with a call to the international community to “force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations”.
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas’s speech, saying that the Palestinian leader “would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership.”
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu’s announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescuers want defibrillators in the nerve centers of Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l
The history of border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
The Voivodeship Emergency Rescue Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l wants such devices to be located in the nerve centers of the city.
For their attitude, officials received congratulatory diplomas from the Voivodeship Emergency Rescue Station in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek W<0xC3><0xB3>jcik are officials of the Sub-Carpathian Tax Office in Przemy<0xC5><0x9B>l.
On 28 August, they were serving at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. A Customs and Excise Service officer noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian zone.
A Chinese activist has died in prison as a result of torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the wife of an activist, was called by a Communist Party secretary from her family village on September 23 to report that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What caused his death, he did not reveal.
In Cao's morgue, she saw her husband's body massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in his blood,” she said.
“They wouldn’t let me take my cell phone with me, and there were a lot of police officers around who couldn’t get close to Wang.”
Police pressured her to sign a statement saying her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development
Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program on Friday.
Among the almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there was an interplay between the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on the AR game engine, creating a real-world map with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test-training platform for the verification of practical skills and skills.
The objective of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market in the perspective of 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching PLN 300 million in support for entrepreneurs under this sector program are a significant boost for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu”, reads the statement.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.
“Incentives introduced by the government for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&D incentives, competency improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by NCBR drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in the highly competitive market, trade fairs and trade fairs”.
The head of the department of science notes that the money for innovation not only goes to the innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also remains in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
“The amount of deducted costs related to R&D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this discount.
This is equivalent to the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
Wojciech Kamieniecki, Director of the NCBR Dr. Eng., recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous grant competitions with a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million.
The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.
“It is particularly gratifying that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of co-financing of approximately PLN 317 million.
The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in funding.
Detailed information about GameINN III results can be found at ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admits to stealing Kasper Dolberg’s watch
The event took place on September 16.
Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
Not really, because it's worth $70,000.
The angry Dane did not show up for classes the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It was a mystery from the beginning.
Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal, and the club grounds are monitored.
According to AFP, he eventually confessed to the theft of Diaby-Fadiga.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danes to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generation players in France.
He came to Nice as a 13-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.
He has played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as the newspaper “L’Equipe” reported – the club will probably dissolve it with immediate effect.
For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
We all know that you need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before a meal).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
But most of us are short-tempered.
Just warm water and plain soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even advise them).
When washing, we wipe not only the undersides and tops of the hands, but also: finger tips (joined or single) – wipe them with colliding motions on the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (sweat your hands, rubbing your fingers on each other), thumbs – we wrap each thumb in the palm of your hand and wrap it in the palm of your hand.
In an emergency situation (when you can not wash your hands) we should wipe your hands with a wet towel, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the latches or the door with washed hands (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iran's President Says He Rejects Proposal for US Talks, Donald Trump Denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. side during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift the sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the Iranian side had asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed the lifting of all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for entering into negotiations on a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rouhani: Iran will not hold talks in atmosphere of maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he did not agree to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He said he had met with U.S. diplomats because he had been lured by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, then no one is able to predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and he accused European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement “are a precondition that does not allow” for dialogue.
“If we can get rid of this pre-condition and if America gets rid of sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian side’s request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
“Of course I said no,” the president tweeted.
Voltage with atomic arrangement in the background
France, Germany and the UK are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to somehow save the 2015 Iran deal, which they were signatories to.
It stated that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be brought under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, its other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw materials, it will limit its commitments resulting from the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hatter Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in the stalking of judges, was restored to the ruling by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation into Mr. Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not so far turned into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly told about his wife’s mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in the heteristic group, will return to the ruling and will render judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmydt denies his participation in the Hetter Group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.
This is exactly what other judges associated with Casta say: everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.
And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor’s office did not waver to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt’s phone, which stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police did not wave a finger to secure the devices of the people, whom the judge Waldemar <0xC5><0xBB>urek pointed out in a report from February.
There is no evidence – there is no Shmydt’s case, there is no “Kasty” case.
There is also the case of the head of NIK Marian Banasia about renting a house with basements and hiding income.
The CBA checks his statements of assets.
And he'll check when he does.
The Committee on Ambassadorial Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission somehow came together to make a curious decision to dismiss Banas’ deputies and appoint him as his p.o. lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, I think, about how a wife comes home and meets a husband with a mistress in bed.
She's so shocked and devastated that she can't utter a word.
She stands in the doorway of the numbness, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of the bed, dresses and goes out.
And the husband was making a bed.
When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is it?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks: what woman, dear?
Only that the case of “Casta” or Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.

Kamila Li<0xC4><0x87>winko in the final of the jump up
Earlier this season, returning to the competition after the break of the mother player, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championships from London, in the first try defeated 1.85 and 1.89 and in the second 1.92.
1.94 managed to get it only in the third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I can fight, because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final, I will have to jump better technically," Li<0xC4><0x87>winko told Eurosport.
In the eliminations, the best were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik – after 1.94.
Both players are the only ones who have not lost any height.
The women’s finale is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in a serious condition
He went to the hospital, and his condition is described by doctors as severe.
It should be added that he is conscious and aware.
“We believe that it will come out that he will win again.
We all pray for his recovery,” Kornel Morawiecki’s close friend told reporters in an interview with Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by the closest family and politicians,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to journalists two weeks ago.
In January, the Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been tested at the Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw Military Hospital.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
Turns out I have a jaundice.
But the worst was before me.
When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer," the prime minister's father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
“I know a lot of people have been praying for me, so thank you very much.
Fortunately, I don't have metastases.
I don't know yet if I'm going to go through chemotherapy.
I give myself into the hands of medical professionals who are rather good at thinking.
For now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to some state of usability.
I hope that everything will be fine," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with SE in January.
“If I were to give in too late, the situation would be tragic, and I would say goodbye to the fall,” he added.
Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w: Missing 14-year-old
Officers from the Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w Municipal Police Command are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osy.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked to contact us.
The missing woman left her place of residence on the evening of September 26 and has not returned or made contact with her relatives.
She was last seen at Stary Go<0xC5><0x9B>ciniec Street in Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w.
Nel Stok<0xC5><0x82>osa is 14 years old, measures 167 cm, has blond hair and blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing person is asked to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of O<0xC5><0x82>awski jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the racecourse on Oleandra street in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, may be confusing for some.
The road to true power is a long one, but this is the name of one of the types of equestrian competition.
The competition for the power of jumps consists of overcoming by the rider and horse higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding here that the long and still unbeaten world record, established in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, of course, no one jumped, but the score of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also not among the worst...
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "In the saddle", were a demonstration part of the "Dancing equestrian competitions" played there a little before, which we write about more widely in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons entered the competition, training riding in the O<0xC5><0x82>awa JKS.
Four of them competed on cocks, and four on big horses.
In the first group, the best was written by Nikola Szo<0xC5><0x82>dra, who arrived at the crazy "Sprinter".
This small, but how dynamic rumac began by overcoming obstacles spread out at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with an upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three subsequent refusals that he was removed from further competition by the jury of the competition.
The second place in the pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who performed "Fama", and the third by Lena Boru<0xC5><0x84> on "Harmider".
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through the obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".
Even more emotions accompanied the starting Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.
Terrible-looking falls included Paulina Shewczyk, who made the “Declaration” and Anastasija Abramenko, who drove on the “Airplane”.
Fortunately, apart from the small bruises neither the Amazons nor the horses, nothing bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young mulberry "Wineta" to the parkur had a neighboring Weronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz.
She needed either a trainer’s assistant or another horse for the couple, behind which a little crazy “Wineta” snarled.
After counting the obstacles from the parkur, she also went down in full glory, so at times in boxing and on the airstrip it was dangerous. “Everything is under control!”, Jan Sienkiewicz reassured somewhat frightened spectators, especially the youngest.
From the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska was a great writer on the course, approaching the beautifully presented “Whisky”.
This decent mackerel, paired with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at the moment.
After a while, however, Paulina Shewczyk included the same amount on the “Declaration”, Weronika <0xC5><0x81>uczkiewicz on the “Wine” and Anastasija Abramenko on the “Airplane”.
To decorate the fleet and after receiving the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these players went together, and finally, together with the Amazons on the paw in the rhythm of Radecki’s march, they made an impressive honorary round, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.
Gratitude
The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" warmly thanks the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the XVI "Former Equestrian Competitions": the City Office in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the Water and Sewerage Plant in O<0xC5><0x82>awa, the County Council and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko splits from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonka’s political formation #R Revolution was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.
Before the elections Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution itself Max Kolonko was not even able to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any electoral district.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has finished working with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll be waiting for the KWW to delete my name from the name.
Please do not combine my person with the mentioned entity," he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.
It is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who is in the United States, announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’re tired of politicians, tired of your stupid games, tired of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The party’s programme included issues relating to the judiciary (general elections should be selected), tax changes (comparison of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of NATO’s eastern flank, with special reference to the Polish referendum), and the implementation of the Polish referendum.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile a message suggesting that #R will join forces with the Kukiz’15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions ultimately came to fruition.
UBS: Gold close to equilibrium
“The euro exchange rate will be around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of gold quotations on the current ceiling,” the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not opt for rate hikes in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks ease policy.
“As long as gold is properly valued – the euro notes should remain in the vicinity of the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive enough, according to him.
Bonds from emerging markets offer much more favourable returns than Polish securities,” says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.
“The global slowdown may deepen further, but it should not lead to a severe recession, and at most to a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero,” Bolliger said.
“Investors should be wary of global actions that could harm the lack of prospects for a U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump’s impeachment procedure and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively weakly", according to the latest letter to investors from UBS Wealth Management’s chief executive, Mark Haefele.
“Shares from euro area countries should behave worse than US ones because they are more vulnerable to heightened uncertainty around global trade and concerns about slowing down,” the report said.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of banks’ monetary policy.
The Fed has the largest field for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency in the coming years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotations is a cap of $1.29, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed's rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.
“To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long run may not allow deficits in the current account and budget,” Bolliger said.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential report of the German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 pieces of weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential report prepared in the German Defense Ministry.
The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of Parliamentary Secretary of State in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), so far two pieces of weapons, one part of weapons and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have been recovered.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 cannons for MG3 machine guns are missing.
Concerns about the situation were expressed by the vice-president of the Left party, Martin Renner.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing pieces of weapons and ammunition is "horrifying".
Moreover, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.
Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a “poor balance sheet”.
She also criticized the fact that the report does not reveal whether there is also a weapon found during the investigation against Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening the security of the state and access to it.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians with far-right and racist motives.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosive charges.
Crying kids on a plane.
How to avoid them?
There is a solution
The carrier Japan Airlines has recently used a feature developed for people for whom traveling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the website, the lines allow you to check the distribution of seats on the plane.
If a minor travels to the second year of age, the “child icon” appears on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place remote from that occupied by the little one.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the imperfection of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of aircraft.
As expected, the idea was shared by Internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
“We need to learn tolerance, because soon we’re going to need a map of seats for mouth-breathing, salivating or drunkards,” G Sundar wrote.
Another of the Internet users noticed that once he was disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There are also supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me about screaming children during a 13-hour trip,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Majorca Counts Losses After Bankruptcy of Travel Agent Thomas Cook
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not come on holiday to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearics Marc Pons informed on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. the company Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers, who had to give up their holidays in Majorca next month because of the bankruptcy of the British company, are German citizens and Scandinavian countries.
However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island during the November-April period, the losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands has already begun negotiations with international operators on the “entry into the market of Majorca” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.
About 800 are dismissed employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palmyra.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, with the announcement of the bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels in Majorca, the owners of the properties asked guests to pay an additional fee for accommodation.
This situation has been experienced by, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that several dozen hotels in Majorca have been put on hold until at least the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its subsidiaries.
On Friday, the Diario de Ibiza newspaper said that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with Thomas Cook are not going to be closed in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they will ask the government of Spain for support of the region in the amount of 100 million euros to cover the losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are located in Majorca.
According to the data of the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is relying on local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019 about 5 million euros.
FIFA Women's Ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, USA at the helm
The Polish women's national team is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Mi<0xC5><0x82>osz St<0xC4><0x99>pi<0xC5><0x84>ski was classified in the previous July report.
Weak personnel matches.
How will it be in October?
The leaders remained American women, who recently defended the title of world champion.
The second place in the ranking was held by the Germans, and the third was held by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start the departure match with the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, it was – due to food poisoning of the opponents – postponed by a year.
In this situation, the Poles will inaugurate the qualification with a meeting with the Spaniards on November 12 in Lublin.
Earlier, the White and Red will play two social matches – on October 3 on the way out from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of rivals Poles are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from second place advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second position will play in the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
The men's national team of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
"Rz": Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are zero, and coal stoves will be soaring this winter as if they never had anything,” reads the front page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita.”
“So far, 82,000 applications have been submitted for funding under the Clean Air programme with a total value of PLN 2 billion, of which 48,000 were positive decisions.
The accepted applications amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million, "Rz said, citing data from the spokesman of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is reimbursed from the program.
The results of the announced noisy program the journal assesses as "modest".
The self-governments, quoted by “Rz”, see the failures of “Clean Air” in, among other things, too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic reporting, sending invoices by mail, possible random control of implementation.
This would make things easier," says Mayor of Lidzbark Warmi<0xC5><0x84>ski Jacek Wi<0xC5><0x9B>niowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operations, less than 1% of the goal of exchanging 3 million potted boilers was realized.
According to Rz, although the budget of the program is 103 billion zlotys per 10 years, that is, 10 billion zlotys per year, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy for this year, 1.4 billion PLN was reserved,” we read.
Congress agrees to F-35 for Poland
B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak: Price negotiations now
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35 aircraft to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work,” Mariusz B<0xC5><0x82>aszczak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best possible price," the Polish minister added.
Contract for the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by the Lockheed Martin concern.
In mid-September, the US State Department agreed to sell them to Poland.
The statement stressed that the investment will support national security and U.S. foreign policy by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighter jets.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related logistics and program support elements and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, produced by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seat, single-engine, fifth-generation multirole fighter.
The aircraft is capable of performing close-up support missions, bombings, and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for near range radars.
The F-35 fighter jet was recently purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16s.
The purchase of U.S. warplanes is also to be considered by other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Sex dolls
Producer Barbie introduced a series of gender-neutral dolls to the market.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Producer Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figures and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the Creative World series wear wigs.
Children can therefore decide whether their Barbie is to have short hair or long.
Their wardrobe consists of both trousers and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys with girls and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
It was also abandoned to emphasize the characteristic features of gender – gender dolls no longer have full mouths, long eyelashes and slim waist or – in Ken’s case – wide shoulders.
The company believes that children do not like when their dolls have imposed gender norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made for a particular gender inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will make all children feel free,” Mattel said.
Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in swimsuits and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes” such as an unnatural proportion of the body.
The company has responded to criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes to the market.
There were also dolls in the hijab.
Zandberg: around or club Together can have several members
Zandberg asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the result of the Kom.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by the hope that the Left is not only right, but also has the strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60-80 members.
“This may mean that there will be a dozen or so members of the club.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I will not guess and tell you how it will happen," he said.
Asked if the Left Together will have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied: “We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader W<0xC5><0x82>odzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
On the other hand, given that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that “the goal of the political party is to represent its voters”.
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.
In the run-up to the Senate election, he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would take an election certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
"I don't think I would try to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski (Ko-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this district, outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the Citizens of the Republic of Poland Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS start.
Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot in the district of Bopp, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.
The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a member of the Sufi current of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare sub-wet area handed over by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque ("Ways to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, worshipped by the followers as a saint.
The mosque is lined with Carrara marble and has five minarets.
The highest one is 78 meters.
The mosque inside will accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the other one may be on the outer esplanade.
In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, financed lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Coach Smy<0xC5><0x82>a: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
The pass of eight league matches without a win, the players of the Crown will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-class extra-class Silesia.
"Our problem is not wroc<0xC5><0x82>awing, but ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing," stressed Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Smy<0xC5><0x82>a, a Kielce coach.
The players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first row, when on the way out they defeated 1: 0 benjaminka of the game Cz<0xC4><0x99>stochowa Cancers.
Later, they recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0–1 to Zag<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>bi Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I’m optimistic that in the last seconds of the game, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to draw.
Their fall to the wall after the last whistle was not a result of the collapse, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close,” Smy<0xC5><0x82>a said.
As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be sensitive to the team playing in the side sectors of the field.
“We are aware of the opponent’s quality, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.
In Friday's match in Korona, he will certainly not play a pausing for excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the team will also be missing injured Jakub <0xC5><0xBB>ubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
The building, on the other hand, is the registration in the cup match of several players with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it will not be, and now it is,” Smyla said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the extra-class anyone can win with anyone.
“We are a good team.
"We may not be showing it on the pitch in the last few weeks, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be as early as Friday," he said.
After nine rows of extra-class crown with a score of five points, he occupies the 15th position.
Silesia has collected 12 more and is in second place.
The Friday match in Kielce will start at 8.30 p.m.
These trees may disappear completely from Europe.
“42% of European tree species are at risk,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the “Red Book of European Trees” published on Friday.
At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and peacocks.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was developed by experts who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
When it comes to typical European tree species, according to IUCN experts, 58 percent of species are at risk, and 15 percent, or 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanization, over-intensive logging, and further forest fires and changes taking place in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and crops is also highly endangered.
“The effects of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of the extinction of important and underestimated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet,” concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for freedom that future generations will have to repay,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
He said, “The whole policy of PiS is a pic.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away”.
Schetyna assures in conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.
It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.
In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski party.
“Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of the PiS, a party that has mistrusted proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency,” says Schetyna.
The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.
“First, nothing of the data will be received, but we need to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which is visible even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Secondly, it is about “starting up the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably – and those who are entrepreneurial”.
Schetyna explains that in the KO program there is a project that will give the least-earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also by several hundred.
The politician also said that he does not want to race for distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but does not promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition on the distribution, until finally there was a financial collapse of the country,” he said.
Shetyn also stated in an interview with Rz that Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
"The fox walks before the fall.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski is such a man of state as Banas is crystal,” he added.
The PO leader also said that he has not yet decided whether to run for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Dead Great Condors
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, according to TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The great condors were probably poisoned with a means of killing predators such as cougars, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten a toxic falcon.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“It’s a big loss to the environment because a condor has to reach 10 to 15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we are losing the protected species, the endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the president
Work has begun on awarding the head of the precious chain state.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda’s law firm – we read in “Rzeczpospolita”.
As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.
It was probably last used by President Ignacy Mo<0xC5><0x9B>cicki.
"Rz" states that soon such a chain may fall on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to begin work on the amendment of the law on orders and designations in order to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was dropped by one vote.
This time, the work is immediate.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would reach the opinion of the Office of the President.
This one came in mid-September.
"I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," the then-presidential minister Andrzej Dera wrote.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and again devoted little time to the matter.
“The President’s office has answered us briefly: it is behind to restore it,” said the head of the commission Robert Mam<0xC4><0x85>tov from PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a request for legislative work, which the committee supported.
Police Officers Will Teach Drivers How to Drive Across the Crossroads
The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>skiego Avenue and Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Avenue.
The uniformed actions have something to do with the city authorities’ recent complaints about drivers not always being able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, the police begin preventive activities in Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w "Transient Crossings".
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of going down, not complying with light signals or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” Marek Ustrobi<0xC5><0x84>ski, the city’s vice president, said a few days ago.
His words sounded at a press conference of the city council, at which the city authorities presented examples of improper movement of cars after crossings, which in effect creates traffic jams.
At the time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster driving in the lights or not writing text messages while driving.
The topic was somehow taken over by the Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w police officers, who are starting from today the action “Transient Crossings”.
What's going on?
The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of traffic restrictions at intersections by drivers entering on them without the possibility of continuing driving.
It is a frequent offense that contributes to the increase of traffic difficulties and the formation of traffic jams.
He is threatened with a warrant of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and improper parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity of driving, late movement under the indicators, free passage of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will action be taken?
These include Lisa-Kuli Street in Jagiellonian Street; Ciepli<0xC5><0x84>ski Street in Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; Targowa Street in Pi<0xC5><0x82>sudski Street; <0xC5><0x9A>reniawit<0xC3><0xB3>w Square in D<0xC4><0x85>browski Street; and Hetman<0xC5><0x84>ski Street in Warsaw Uprisings.
This type of action in the capital Podkarpacie will be carried out in the next Friday of October.
Controlling the company that disposes of waste from “Czajki”
“Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of Wo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84>ski County and the District Inspectorate of Construction Supervision checked on Friday the installation in the municipality of Zielonka, in which waste from the sewage treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw is disposed of,” said the spokesman of the Old Town of Kar<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ski.
Inspectors from the Vo<0xC5><0x82>omi<0xC5><0x84> region carried out a control in a plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Commercial and Transport Plant "Dar-Trans", under the agreement with the capital wastewater treatment plant "Czajka" performs waste management services.
"The installation was inspected and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be forwarded, among other things, to the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw.
The last inspection in the "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then established that the company did not perform sampling, measurements and testing of groundwater, nor did it have the results of studies of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the wastewater treatment plant "Czajka".
After the control of WIO<0xC5><0x9A>, Dariusz Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the “Czajka” wastewater treatment plant.
According to the decision to carry out waste disposal on the site of the plant, waste weighing up to 60,000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that at the end of November and December 2018, STUOS was shut down, which was related to the damage to one of the incinerator equipment.
As reported by MPWiK, the monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of the export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa supported Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa told Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska on Friday.
"Mr. President, these are very important words for me," said the candidate of the Civic Coalition for the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now "only a fan of retirement".
Ma<0xC5><0x82>gorzata Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska met on Friday with former President Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk.
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa’s son, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw, also took part in a short conversation behind closed doors.
"You have taken on a difficult task," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is great hope that you, as a woman, will cope with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Very important words
Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska thanked for the support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words to me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution, and you know how important it is,” she said.
“Let us show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
This is how you made your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” said Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska.
Retired caretaker
Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa, speaking to reporters, said he is now “just a pensioner”.
“Of course I’m looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to this) we will return.
The triangle of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessarily needed.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we have the street criterion," Lech Wa<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>sa said.
“That’s why it’s so important for Poles to go to the elections, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said.
“The last chance that we will improve the state of things as it is in Poland,” the former president replied.
“We need to rebuild the foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes for her that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-B<0xC5><0x82>o<0xC5><0x84>ska said: “Mr. President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no tripartite power, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward.”
ME netters: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot ground in Ljubljana, Polish netters faced the Slovenians in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
There was no lack of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
"White-Red" lost 1:3 and will play for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key laws.
The Senate passed without amendment the law on disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important people in the state.
For the amendment of the law on the assets of the families of state officials – without amendments – 52 senators voted, 14 were against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments, submitted during Wednesday's debate by Senator S<0xC5><0x82>awomir Rybicki.
According to him, the amendments had the law to “civilize” and limit the scope of the information given in the statement on the property situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The law on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the Prime Minister’s Office, was adopted by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions stipulate that, among others, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to place in a joint statement of assets of the children and their dependents.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on flights of the most important people in the country.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government planes along with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.
The bill – without amendments – was passed by 55 senators, 12 were against, four abstained.
According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "performed in an official mission".
In the flights of the President will be able to accompany family members and other persons invited by the President.
On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “performed in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function performed”.
The law also specifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations on board the aircraft, there may be members of the delegation – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate office of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.

After the first training in Paris, the Poles are waiting for the last rival
Polish netizens held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will perform in a match for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen’s teammate closed the way to the title on Thursday’s defeat with the Slovenians 1:3 in Ljubljana.
There were rumours about their troubles with the trip to the duel.
This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they held a training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Micha<0xC5><0x82> Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the exercise of the network elements.
“We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally taken to the ground.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We still thought we’d come back to this game.
We discussed this game with each other in the squad, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As the two main causes of failure, I would point out the ineffectiveness of the attack and much worse than usually dealing with situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he said.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the supported by a loud and numerous audience co-hosts of the tournament.
He admitted that the world champions could have fallen asleep a bit on their way to the semi-finals.
“Perhaps if we had failed in a similar way in the group stage, we would have analyzed this lesson more quickly and then we would have played differently in the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a blunder," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday’s defeat of the Poles will be turned into aggression in the bronze match.
“I hope that we will show our true face.
There's something to fight for.
The last time we won a medal was in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and in the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: Tough penalty, but in suspension
The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine – on a six-month suspension – for insulting words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour drivers lose patience for Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the offenses of the most unbaptized professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks of breaks plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the haughty athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been struggling for a long time and has achieved his own tennis world record – he had to pay the highest in the history of the discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting a judge and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chaczanov – all for this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113,000 dollars.
At the 2019 US Open, he did not play for long, but he managed to say publicly that the ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of starts and another fine.
However, the words about corruption were forgiven to him, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, in the justification, tennis activists said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behavior throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and was almost a continuous violation of the rules, that he repeatedly insulted in a vulgar way people associated with tournaments and spectators.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply with several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and the ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of this kind
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also consulted outside the season with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’s first social media comment on the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Laver Cup, his shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.
He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco, earned more than $1.3 million, so even after fines he will still have a lot.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
According to the report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday, as good or rather good their material situation was assessed in the ub.r. as 44% of them.
The previous year this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office first examined the subjective assessments of the situation of households – it never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1 per cent of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad in ub.r., compared to 11.2% a year earlier and over 20% in 2009.
The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.
In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.
On the second pole are the households of renters, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a major influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to single parents raising offspring, of which 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.
Among couples with children, this percentage ranges (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by parents raising offspring alone and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of the voivodships there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best estimates are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
There are also Lubuskie Voivodeships (47.7 per cent), Silesian Voivodeship (47.6 per cent), Mazovia Voivodeship (47.3 per cent) and West Pomeranian Voivodeship (47.1 per cent).
Meanwhile, in Opolskie, the regulatory income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94 percent of the national average in ub.r., and in Lubuskie 98 percent.
The highest incomes were the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesian (104 per cent).
In Poland, on average, the per capita income was PLN 1,693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Against the background of previous years, the result is quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7%, and a year later by 6.3%.
While income growth slows down, it also slows spending growth.
These per capita figures amounted to PLN 1,187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9 per cent in real terms, and in 2016 by 4.3 per cent.
Surveys of household budgets suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

U.S.: Three suicides among aircrew
The three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and the earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot to death last week.
Each of the events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush docked off the coast of Virginia.
So far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
In addition, death is not related to each other.
“The need for everyone to be involved in putting forward suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
“I want to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Nisio<0xC5><0x82>owski critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.
“Actually, all of his opinions were accepted.”
Then came the criticism of some of his actions.
“For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk is a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best yet during the life of the Pope of Poland,” he explained.
“There were rumours of discontent, the Pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had the power, and for political reasons he could just throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, as did his successors," Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski explained.
“Furthermore, this fatal case of paedophilia and the actions of the Church, and in fact their absence, has taken place.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.
We have known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these hideous things,” he says in an interview with the journalist Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski.
In the opinion of the former Polish PO policy, the Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, where crosses were hung everywhere.
Now these crosses are Pisan, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisan regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will come to pay for its salt," Niesio<0xC5><0x82>owski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will persecute J<0xC4><0x99>draszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind,” he said.
HRUBIESZ<0xC3><0x93>W: Tomorrow the celebrations of the 590th anniversary of the county

PZPN pours punishments behind bars in stadiums.
Gryf disqualified
The start of the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gda<0xC5><0x84>sk with a small hair did not end tragically, when the goalie of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic, who was fired by fans from Wejherowo, passed by millimeters.
After this incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating the case has imposed a harsh penalty on Gryffindor, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, fans will not be allowed into the next match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to leave for league matches until December 31.
Burdy at the Widzewa <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> stadium also evoked the fans of Silesia Wroc<0xC5><0x82>aw.
However, PZPN’s ruling was more lenient here, because Silesia had warned that similar events could occur and had sensitized the relevant authorities on the matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the <0xC5><0x81><0xC3><0xB3>d<0xC5><0xBA> fans sector to be overturned, the burning of chairs and the forcing of the hosts sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to matches including and the next edition of PP.
The ban also covered the league matches Ekstraklasa, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange the markings on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzesz<0xC3><0xB3>w
In Podkarpacie, implementation of the amendment of the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, the registration of foreign city names on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our province, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on the detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of the villages in the neighboring countries often have a Polish sound as well.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the road signs at our roads.
The introduction of the new signage starts from the A4 motorway section of Podkarpackie”, informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpacie, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total cost of investment?
200 thousand PLN.
In the first instance, the new designation will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
What should the implementation of the idea look like?
It will be eaten without exchange of plates, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the currently functioning village names with new ones, written in Polish on the already existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a swan from a windmill.
In the pond in Zameczna na Dolny <0xC5><0x9A>l<0xC4><0x85>sk, residents noticed a swan with problems with its wings.
After the catch and the visit to the veterinarian, it turned out that someone made a target out of the animal – a windmill shot was found in his body.
“The information about the injured bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nowa Sola.
According to the report, the animal had broken wings.
We went to the place.
It was immediately clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely, so as not to hurt him and not to expose him to additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to a veterinarian.
After the first photo of the RTG, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield out of it.
There were fragments of a bullet in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation centre.
Winter at the Centre
“The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water was provided, a safe place in the resort, where he would spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He is not yet able to fly.
The release of him now would be associated with the fact that he would most likely not survive the winter,” Walasek adds.
Staff after undergoing swan rehabilitation intends to release him in the spring to the same joint.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal’s ill health, the authorities of the <0xC5><0xBB>ukovice municipality intend to inform the prosecutor’s office about the matter.
The event took place in the castle.
Gowin: “we need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, you will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said on Friday Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jaros<0xC5><0x82>aw Gowin, leader of the Agreement.
During a conversation in the "Signals of the day" on radio station Edynce, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot develop.
Given that this problem is very difficult to deal with, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received "contradiction from the EC".
“We won in front of the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, we will return to this issue,” he said.
At the same time, he pointed out that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade”.
“In addition, one will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake by ruling that the Polish retail tax was an illegal public aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 per cent of income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent of income above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was supposed to be in effect from September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission launched proceedings against Poland for breach of EU law.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.
She then stated that the tax had been implemented in a way that was not in accordance with the law.
It also issued an order suspending the use of the tax until the end of its analysis by officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
May's ruling by the EU court paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the TSUE informed PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, where both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
For the time being, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible hearing, will start.
It takes a good few to a few months from the filing of the appeal to the announcement of the verdict.
“Such proceedings last an average of a year,” a source told the Luxembourg court.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer a few practical solutions
Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first occasion on which the whole family is focused around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.
No wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look their best on this day.
However, before you make the final decision as to the outfit of the child, think about whether it will also be comfortable.
In stores, you can find many outfits that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child
Until recently, babies of several weeks old were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same casks or big breaths.
Today, children who enter the sacrament are often older: several months, years, or even older.
It is not difficult to imagine that such a great consolation needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3–4 months old on the day of baptism, he or she will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the hands of his or her parents or christians.
The best way out will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.
Although this element of the wardrobe is considered to be a daily outfit, it is enough to look for its sacred variants, for example, with a skirt or lace.
For the boy will be perfect points with the imprint of a shell and a shell.
In the case of older children, you can afford a bigger fantasy in the costume.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress
Many parents of girls with a longing look towards richly decorated, wavy christening dresses in a set with coats, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.
Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and charming sets will make your little girl look gorgeous and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit
Until recently, among the boys' parents, there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.
Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or helmets often made the young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.
Today, fortunately, they were worn by comfortable, cotton ensembles.
Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is soft, jersey pants, and in addition the blouse decorated from the front on the pattern of the vest.
These machines look extremely sacred, and at the same time do not constrain the movements of the child who knows the world.

Voting on a break in the proceedings of the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party’s annual program conference, as requested by the government.
289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.
Usually, the House of Commons does not deliberate during party conferences, so that members do not have to give up either their participation in them or their parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties agreed that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK’s planned 31 October exit from the European Union, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the government, there were 289 MPs, against 306.
Two opposition parties are already in the process of signing the conventions.
No consent to the break can be received as a political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was found by the Supreme Court to be inconsistent with the law and non-existent) and for the fact that after the judge’s ruling, he will not.
Following that ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, with Johnson’s speech and the ensuing stormy debate being the most important event of the day.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It’s time for Brexit.
It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.
“Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens’ priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.
“Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference is set to begin in Manchester on Sunday and run until Wednesday, October 2.
Conferences of two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the justifications that Johnson gave in explaining the long suspension of parliament was precisely party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda accuses Israel of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” the foreign media reported.
The president's spokesman has strongly denied these reports.
“That’s just not true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, wrote that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in New York, said that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said that the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that “the Poles suckled anti-Semitism with their mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel has not apologized for humiliating statements by its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Ambassador of Poland to Israel Marko Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted: “Polish, Polish”.
“The quote is not only inaccurate.
That’s just not true,” B<0xC5><0x82>a<0xC5><0xBC>ej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland”.
According to Spychalski, the portal “made it up”.
According to “JI” interlocutors, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it is the Jews of Israel “like Israel Kac” who are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the portal, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's statement.
Who is Bana<0xC5><0x9B> and what did he do?
The tenement rented by the Suteners led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banas’s estate statements.
We're summarizing another affair that shook the ruling camp.
The journalists of “Supervisor” TVN revealed that Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B>, the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, in recent years did not sign up to the property statement of the 400-meter tenement house, which is located on the Cracow Podg<0xC3><0xB3>rz.
What's more, his sub-tenant had to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement (and therefore rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly since 2016 a security for the repayment of the loan.
Bertold Kittel drew attention to the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".
The journalist revealed that from Banasia, the apartment was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> responded to the allegations vaguely and vaguely.
Interestingly, the tenement rented by the Suteners led the journalist to discover the negligence in Banasia’s estate statements.
The house itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be reduced.
“The assets of Marian Banasi and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently in charge of controlling Marian Banasia’s property declarations for the years 2015–2019.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until its completion. “I will go to your marshals for free leave,” he said.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
“We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or expedite the investigation of Marian Banas’s statements of assets.
That is why we are forced to extradite the state authorities and give notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.
“If a normal Pole had so blatantly underestimated the price of renting his property, he would have already had 10 controls, a tax ruling and criminal proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Bana<0xC5><0x9B> is the new President of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was filed by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of this party were accepted.
Previously, Bana<0xC5><0x9B> was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005 and worked at this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski.
During the first PiS governments (2005-2008) Bana<0xC5><0x9B> held the position of President of the Customs Service, and also Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
From 2015 he again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and from 2017 he managed the National Tax Administration.
Bana<0xC5><0x9B> served as finance minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master introduces a graphics card holder to the market

This is exactly the solution – the handle for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented by Cooler Master.
The new graphics card holder model is not only a functional solution that allows you to maintain the graphics card more securely without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the command of the policeman will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding an order of a particular conduct issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.
The federal police want to make that change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
“The case is serious, because already now every year more than half a million criminal cases are brought before Polish courts,” we read.
Rzeczpospolita has determined that the petition, which the Independent Union of Police Officers writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences, has a chance of success.
The petitioners propose the new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.
It should read: "Whoever does not submit to the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, is subject to the penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, by not carrying out orders, prevent or hinder the performance of an official function,” the newspaper states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political matters of demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be disadvantageous and instead of relieving the situation, they would even exacerbate it,” he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that each month the services take 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras worries about Europe
J<0xC3><0xA1>chym Topol has a writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in a row with V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of talent was upon J<0xC3><0xA1>chym, which J<0xC3><0xA1>chym is trying to use.
Eight years later, he returned with “The Sensitive Man.”
The protagonists are Buras and So<0xC5><0x88>a together with two sons, who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, they travel around Europe.
He is a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth did not make a sound, and for the second time he stopped in infancy.
But it is not the heroes that are the most important in this story.
They are all just a background for observing a world in which there is no longer room for artistic nomads.
It’s a world of clogged provinces, a society of old, suspicious people, and dissolute youth.
The “sensitive man” becomes an absurd theatrical figure.
The narrative imitates the didascalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of worries about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines Cancelled 105 Flights Due to Thomas Cook Bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.
The court in Ghent also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
At present, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the announcement by the British company of the bankruptcy of the mother, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office was then reassured that customers who bought trips in it, will go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – announced the bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the <0xC2><0xA3>900m rescue plan agreed in August, the company earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnovers.
However, the company’s problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.

“I don’t think Slovenia played fantastic.

G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for reviews
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for the arrival of the German G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz.
The actions are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz is the most easterly city in Germany.
A beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.
G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city’s population.
In 2013 it reached 54,000 people.
Wanting to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted.
Two-thirds of them were residents of major cities.
The program was also interested in people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
“When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to G<0xC3><0xB6>rlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel like it doesn’t matter whether we stay here for four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has 7,000 free housing units, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.
While the city authorities hope that some will move on permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from program participants.
The information gathered from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, program manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in American Tulsa, Oklahoma.
