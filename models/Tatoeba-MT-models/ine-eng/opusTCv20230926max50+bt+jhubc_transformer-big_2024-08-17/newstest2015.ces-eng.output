Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Last minute transfer?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s replacement goalkeeper, is not currently on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, speaks with Czech journalists and prepares to play for the Czech national team with the Americans and then also for the start of qualifying for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In the new season of the Premier League, Chelsea are favored by Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic for the first time in ten years in the London club got to the position of substitute.
It has been speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in a fight with Athletics and failed to enter the league season, losing 2–4 in San Sebastian.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He had two wins and two draws in the French league season, and shot St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille on the weekend with a 1-1 draw.
On the boulevard’s English websites, there have been reports that Czechs might want to join the Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, <0xC4><0x8C>ech’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote a 4:1 course on it.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100 percent in football.
Maybe during the day there will be an offer that will not be refused.
What would such an offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know what an offer that can't be turned down actually looks like.
There would have to be a consensus on all sides. Above all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether or not the club would deal with a possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transition when you are in Prague now?
Would it not be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in the new premises?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere in the national team meetings and certainly a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So it would certainly be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation I didn’t catch in the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
"I want to continue to participate in the fight for Chelsea's position and it's up to the coach who chooses what decisions he will make in the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sport aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family belong, of course.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
That's a question I thought was never going to affect me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karrat arrested a 20-year-old man after a motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it was driven 125 km/h in a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h and entered the bush to escape the police.
A police patrol in Karrat attempted to stop the blue motorcycle at the edge of the road in the morning when they noticed that it was going 125 km/h at the exit of the petrol station on Bathgate Road.
According to the police, the driver did not stop and continued on Burgess Road and then turned into a bush, so the police lost sight of him.
The motorcyclist and the person who corresponded to the description of the driver were then seen in a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police have accused a 20-year-old youth of disobeying a call to stop and reckless driving.
The trial in Karrat will take place on September 23.
The motorcycle was detained for three months.

George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He allegedly raped a woman on 7 June 2013 at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to Webster, he attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a date for the November 17 hearing at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect union organizing as a civil right.
“The way unions work, jobs work for the middle class,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the congressional committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to introduce a law that strengthens the status of employees, along with John Lewis's model of occasional rights.
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination when organizing in trade unions as other forms of discrimination – and will stop anti-union forces
To amend the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to engage in trade unions to be tried in civil court – and to judge compensation or compensation for damages – is a right and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents of the law are proposing is to re-attach the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states — Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand, and respect labor rights.
There have been times, and millions of Americans still remember, when the country with one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, incorporated language into them, and openly recognized that “the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly states: “The right to create unions that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will limit this right or seek to damage it will be cancelled. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide treaty, the drafters and Roosevelt included in it a guarantee that "every person has the right to exercise his or her rights."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create labor unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is imperative to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the trade unions did not reduce the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an undisguised level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - has come a long way.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have lifted America and made it a true promise of democracy.
A judge has temporarily blocked a law that could have shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
A decree signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of performing their practice.
A judge’s ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions, and in the meantime must obtain this permission.
"The designating party will be able to legally conduct its activities and in the meantime obtain a permit," federal judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution regarding the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get a permit.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a rogue law designed to prepare them for health and their rights,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and also apply for this permission.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Veterans for women’s abortion rights, along with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this license places on doctors requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortions objected by saying that the measures were aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that due to the measures, the clinics would be closed.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only one abortion doctor is allowed in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not penalize doctors who perform abortions while they wait for a claim to be granted.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video of their late mother's holding, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the woman for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate was seen in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors may be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease can best be treated by gynecologists, who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite improvements in distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old mother Elisha Neave of Gold Coast was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the reduction in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary loss of homeowners under the age of 35 could result in up to <0xC2><0xA3>10 million a year in gardening centres by the time today’s young generation of consumers reaches the “major age group of gardeners.”
According to the report, on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own homes will be spent by people who rent their homes.
As other risk factors for the sector, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of pre-gardens used as a parking space, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, the lowest spending on gardening products in the UK is on one household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that living in a sublet or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural advisor for RHS, said: “Renters love growing plants in flower beds – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year thanks to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern Dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin at the meeting of his youth organization, which most reminds me of HitlerJugend, he saved me with atomic weapons and basically made it clear to everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of a fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be controlled by both drunken nationalism and by the complex of inferiorities that can transform them into imperialist feelings.
Time seems to be different in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for domination over Europe was long gone, the East, on the contrary, thinks that the overlooked have long been overlooked and that it is necessary to regain its international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the seizure of power by the Nazis, and then followed by an explosion of nationalism unlike today’s situation in Russia.
And then the cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe little Vladimir was clapping on his shoulder, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to go and maybe they started to underestimate him and he just kept acting like a typical Russian man.
He made arrangements at home, pretended that he didn't really want to go anywhere, and he used to grind knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
He's a leader for life, so he's in a hurry.
He slapped the Caucasians, now he slaps the Ukrainians, then there are the dwarves from the Baltics.
They've been biting the Russian bear in the fur for a long time.
This is certainly already noticed by China, which somehow jumps out a lot and certainly makes a push for the Far East.
And those Germans are also pretty upset about how well they're doing, and I put that on their ass at 45.
How about making a new Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours out there, and the way they're being squeezed in there, and the dacha, they've already wanted to take down a lectern of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they had in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their Prime Minister, Mr. Sobotka, is so soft, he can be peeled like an onion and eat the whole of their EU.
That would be so much fun to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as rioters we will use our compatriots who live in their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when it is said that they are being oppressed there, they are simply being oppressed there, and we will not leave it that way, we will protect them.
And the Russian will rule again, for what else is born.
After all, Europe is only good as a template on which the proud Ivan can dance a goatherd.
Turkey Calls on U.S. Diplomat for Spying Report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called on the country’s top U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish state officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major states are watching each other.
An earlier report that the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara has provoked a more infuriated reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones Series Introduces Another Tricks of the Fourth Series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently shooting episodes of the fifth series of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the series environment and the mass scene, when a giant army of the famous Daenerys becomes out of the crowd of soldiers.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion on the part of police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia region to the office of the Mallorcan State Prosecutor.
The Calvia police chief on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges levelled against businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after being charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street that houses most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday the complainants presented evidence of extortion on the part of police officers and civil servants of the town hall in the Calvia region to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police for links to corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted dissatisfied owners of night-time businesses as saying that the benefits from public officials have a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money, it's about survival," one businessman told the court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to keep an eye on drunks and rioters in a series of holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol tours around bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of the Carnage bar tour, pay a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day was marked by rain and storms, which had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
JARO brought an icy surprise to southern South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds that seriously affected Adelaide’s airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall in the city until nine o’clock in the evening and another 6.6 mm falls during the night on Sunday.
The last rain occurred, along with a few short showers associated with thunderstorms and gusts of wind that began about eight o'clock in the evening and brought nearly 4 mm of rain in about ten minutes.
After several early spring doses arrived after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to just 15.8 °C.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction at a short distance and was forced to delay landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at that time reached a land speed of around 50 km/h.
The flight data showed that the plane had to leave from the second landing and eventually arrived at about 20:40.
The aircraft’s delay subsequently caused further flights to be delayed, including Emirates’ flight from Dubai and Qantas’ flight from Sydney.
It is expected to reach a maximum temperature of 16°C on Tuesday in Adelaide and one or two excesses may occur.
Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer fighting in anti-bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. However, schools in Gaza remain behind.
The beginning of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel, but the signs of struggle are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of the kindergarten hit by the rocket removed the remains of the rubble from the wall and are slowly waiting for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children from this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a bit strange" to go to school all at once.
"We've had some tough times, and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibuc, near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the people.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or left their homes and set out to safer areas further from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are returning home.
The Minister of Education said that about twelve families still did not return.
Their children were temporarily placed in secondary schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was badly hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently, adding, “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to a time-limited peace.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate end to the fighting, it did not address key issues such as Hamas’s demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and re-open airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have hidden in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people who still remain in hiding, and because of the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope they will open the school soon so that we can complete our education as well as the Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
Vrba at the meeting: I stand behind V<0xC3><0xA1>chou.
Lafatu suffers from temperature
The Czech football team met in Prague before noon today before Wednesday's preliminary match with the USA and the following opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
From the twenty-three-member squad, the Spartan striker David Lafat, who is suffering from temperature problems, has problems.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be all right as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days or he's already fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his medical condition, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it's not like they can't train or participate in a game on Wednesday with the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of the Spartan defender Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> V<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Lukas is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to decide, but I am behind it," Vrba said to V<0xC3><0xA1>chov.
What about Shural?
We'll see what happens with Latata.
It is not excluded that in the case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend, for example, the Liberec Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave the hattrick, shone with great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing the form lately.
We'll see how David Lafat does.
In the event that it will not be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I can not nominate any of the players who have taken an interest in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a representation of training at Strahov, then on Tuesday a classic pre-match training before a duel with the USA at Letn<0xC3><0xA1>, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The game with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for a premier victory under the Vrb.
In the previous three preliminary matches, he played two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match with the Netherlands is then on the program on 9 September from 20:45.
Walking in the Netherlands to Italy
Vrba is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous meetings.
It’s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn’t have that much time on before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting the best possible preparation for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
Before the match in Prague, the Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're gonna have a game and we're gonna do it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to well-studied statistics, apartment prices have risen the most in the last seven years.
According to an index of the value of apartments in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase for June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices rose to 10.9%, more than double in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Tim Lawless, director of research at RP Data, said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data shows that apartment prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while prices in Melbourne rose by 11.7%.
Among the other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising by an average of between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by the state-ordered spending cuts and where prices only rose by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has started, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"Given the persistent high rate of auction sales, generally high sales speed and low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will increase even further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said to me, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a colder relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19 and worked in a factory.
Henry tries a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother’s death, Henry underwent “deep” therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve only heard his voice: “Stop with that frame.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were grown-ups - would go to a bar with him and discuss things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I've never spoken to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry recently visited the Dudley foundry, and although the conditions were better than in his father's time, he looked at what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy maze where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always went into the tub and just lay there, then he could hear himself slowly singing for himself, because he was washing the foundry.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet Henry lived a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started to think, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
French, with whom he has been married for 25 years, is still a good friend.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes were starting to show, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tired.
No one wants to eat the carrots themselves.
The shift in Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After receiving critical acclaim for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by a comedy full of errors and August Wilson's Plots.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on stage parodying someone, and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black impersonator/comic on television."
He was learning to walk.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985 I also had to learn how to invent working jokes, be a star and perform on television and it was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer hers because of that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was "for years and years the prized main product of British television" but was also "a grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles, introducing characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For another decade, he was taken away by commercials, documents, television series, and film roles, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he said, “So what are you going to do now, Lene, a little bit of it looks like you’re stuck in one place, or a little bit missing.”
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try it.”
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines from Othello's closing speech for the document, and he was already on his way.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard and I had read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he began to play in a comedy full of errors.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical breakdown and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for capturing the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before the computer can fix it, you have to have 10 minutes of fun.’ ”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in the Plots at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like God's sign saying, "This is what you should do."
Of course, it says it in an audible voice.
So I'm staying on it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains a comedian's brain - all the while our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don’t enjoy it as much as I used to.
I asked if he would ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps outline the beginning, the middle, and the end of the journey – I don’t think I’d ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to look after non-existent employees
Kenya began by biometrically registering all of its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government payroll.
According to the government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer receive a salary.
The government believes that thousands of people are getting paid even after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit conducted this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars a month (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) on salaries of non-existent employees and on further abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries are still being paid into bank accounts even after the employee's death or after the employee leaves the government, said a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must arrive at the identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically, the government said in a statement.
He further says that anyone who fails to make a sufficient apology will be excluded from the pay slip.
“By targeting real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for ‘spiking’ against the government
According to local media, a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "insulting against the government".
The police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a December corruption investigation that targeted government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) called their actions part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools have reopened, but that he is determined to defend the country for the next generations:
Not all schools had a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united front of Ukraine, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk visited by Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will acquire knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for difficult times
It carries with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience with the front lines.
She began her career at the consulting firm Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
For seven years, she served as Executive Director of the Financial Times, resigning when her younger colleague took the top job at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her apostasy was approaching a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended to Lord Browne, a former BP director, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government office.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's work as a goblet of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the centre of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inwards to the top tier of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outwards to the public’s voice in times of unrest when things are not working.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which demands a thorough reform.
But any director would risk coming to a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, breaking it down and preparing himself for work.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn’t so difficult, many people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and how its status is being revised.
As the scope of competition expands and new technology challenges the old certainty, immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC carry with them a great danger.
For a modest <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and costs only 40 pence per day.
Moreover, the popularity of the BBC is clearly rising: to 53% of fans, compared to 31% ten years ago.
BBC service usage patterns have changed: Today, I see news headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I missed on the iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she's found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve of the tweet.
A tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, which was published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic state attorney who instigated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that was not authorized has been removed from my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't respond to any messages with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet was posted by a cheeky, humorous picture of Attorney General Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay for her office, prompting Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to appear before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption read: “I don’t always drive with three times the alcohol level in my blood than the limit is allowed... but if I do, I sue Governor Perry for calling me to account.”
I'm the hottest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Office.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the judge supervising the case to dismiss the charge because the use of the law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry has suspended the payment of $7.5 million from the state’s Public Interest Advocacy Fund, which is based in Travis County and pursuing corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes he gets famous.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might end up, tweeting with his own photo of him running near the lake, and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to "normal"
One of London’s most prominent development companies warned that the housing market in southeastern England had “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices and widespread concerns about the credit bubble led the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s development firm for demanding clients, said Monday: “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.” He adds that this provides a “stable environment for operations.”
London’s housing market was doing well during the decline, as buyers from abroad flooded the capital.
According to the Cadastral Authority, last year alone, prices in the city rose by 18.5%, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average selling price of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London’s real estate has not been as attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also threatened to introduce new property taxes and talk about possible “seat taxes” that politicians came up with ahead of next May’s parliamentary elections.
London real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will also slow the pace of market growth in real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting the housing market is easing.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has cut its 2015 London property price growth forecast to 3% on the grounds that home prices have already begun to fall.
According to real estate firm WA Ellis, transactions in London’s most expensive neighbourhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have fallen by a quarter each year.
Still, demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same and as a result, forward sales continued.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the 2007 crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, returns by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said Berkeley’s annual returns are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posts nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th year of the Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
The star of the Hunger Games movie confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and criticized the hacker for "obvious privacy violations."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on the server for sharing 4chan images, allegedly got thanks to a gap in the system of the Internet storage of Apple iCloud. The alleged list of photos hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Maryan-Kardsen, and Kim Wink.
It's unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" tweeted about the act.
“I hope those of you who look at the photos we took years ago in the privacy of your home are happy with yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the series of cable television Nicklodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were real. On Twitter, she said: "These are my alleged nude photos of the SQUARE, people."
It is better to cut it even in the bud. *deliberate wordplay*.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday evening that pop star Ariana Grande's spokesman denied the photos were true.
An extraordinary example from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They broke up, that's the best way to describe it, gradually unfolded like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
It was only from time to time that a woman told him that he was too serious, too complex, too sharp, too isolated, and maybe a little insidious.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it politely.
He could piss like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was the beginning of a love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even to give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild coat of hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited the estate in a damp but beautiful valley called, aptly, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs blindly signed onto the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on the folding chairs in the long grass, holding his hands behind his back, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to the public station, which provided the region with soothing music and soothing messages, as he gazed at her with his eyes fixed on the musket.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't banned - really banned was nothing - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get to the tenth, as well as the word desuetud<0xC5><0x8D> itself.
The taste of the people has proved what the regulations and the position of the outlaws could never do, and just as the people of the books choose the memoirs in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cooks and romance novels, so in music the ballads are chosen.
The cavern let itself be torn down and began to play the imaginary piano, and in a crude, comic voice he sang the serenade to Aillina's great feet.
The unspeakable.
"That was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, and automatically put two fingers to his mouth.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was little.
His father told him he was playing the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers to a word that started with a j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny back then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly built outside the law, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only one “if” in life.
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she would end up.
Same in humor.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the humor expressed by the song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Due to her age, she could not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
No laws or pressure, either.
A slow society is one in which every part of it agrees with gratitude - with gratitude of those who have been fortunately spared - with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitutions threw for fun and athletics, and so sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature gifted for electronics, have taken responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were the installers, the Greeks who stayed were the dishwashers.
Those of the Persian Gulf states and the Levant, whose ancestors did not leave the country quickly, while they were doing WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED - they were afraid that they would be accused of being put in the fire, in fact, they were afraid that the fire would next time spend it on the ground, they would not eat it, they would eat it, they would eat it, they would eat it.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could have arisen from the clumsy words that Cavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really stupid," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
Beyond the sound-proof sheets, not a word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He meant to say it was a joke, but he refused to put two fingers to her mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
'She seemed funny to him, 'he said at last.
She shook her head in disbelief and shadowed Kevern's view.
All over the world, nothing could be seen but the confusion of her ravenous hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She didn't walk at all.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"Your thick ankles are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of shy.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to be able to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe it was a deliberately cruel cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from the couch, dropped the radio, and poured intoxicated wine.
Wine without vinegar, so you couldn't drink it.
She seemed to shake in her excitement like palm leaves in a storm.
"I am perversely attracted to being a fool," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for him, both because of his unkind words and because of the fear she had in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did you think she'd get hit?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that it was basically the same there as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shimmered about them.
The same bewildered men, then, WHAT HAPPENED, even more insufferable and abominable than their ancestors, the smugglers and the cashiers, were infuriatingly blooming from inn to inn, ready to raise their hand at any woman who would dare to refuse them or mock them.
A fool?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to kiss her - to kiss has become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio whispered - first to kiss her, then to kill her one.
In Kevern’s opinion, too much cultivation, because petting was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally hinted at him leaving.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt frustrated, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She watched him leave, as if she were watching him from a window on the floor, a man who had been caught up in what he had caused.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart closed for him and for all the men in general, despite the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders slumped, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did it seem to her that she knew this look well, even though she could not remember a single moment until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic two-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the unconstitutional monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-heavy violent acts in areas of the country where he was most concerned.
"A lot has been done and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggressiveness of the people who have fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the secluded, hard-to-reach places of the country, where they are still alive despite the peaks of the church towers."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
Residents sigh over sentimental ballads, devour unfortunate stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas, old brutality holds as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that the work is not being done by the authorities.
"Unfortunately, you tend to have too flowery a style," her supervisor said.
I'd suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again defended her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"That's not why I'm asking," Rabinowitz said, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the Church – things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Still dealing with WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz was speaking, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
His head flashed pink on the light board, a recommendation that Ofnow had been sending to the world for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
To speak is better than to keep silent, the word sung is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum softly, when she was sure that her superior had finished, "and I do not claim that the wound did not heal as we pretend it did.
My main concern is that if we are not alerted to this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
It was meant to be endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may have taken and may not have taken as mistakes.
You go too far in talking about venting your “resentment” and “distrust” to “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no "we" and there was no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"In the course of which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took the courage, "we are not without guilt.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no fault that could be caused by someone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the correction was appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past but for us to learn from it?
The past is there to forget.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz opened his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into consideration," he said, and released it.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the sidewalk in a way that passersby described as “brutal and furious.”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho claims that no coup is planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family left for the neighbouring Republic of South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but an army response to the threat of “political fanatics” that police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the Command of the Defence Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several news reports from the intelligence service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were going to make up in the country of the triggers,” he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has seized government power by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces appear to carry signs of a coup d'état," he said.
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believes he is the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the session of parliament due to internal disputes, there has been tension in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the contrary claims, he does not undermine his actions by the government.
Eurozone production is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low, according to a closely watched survey in the euro area in August.
The final index of purchasing managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 is an expansion.
New orders have run out and factories have damaged growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the euro zone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have hinted this week that he is considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States had agreed to during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect of the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the producer is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerns are reigning over France, Italy has again gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring,” Dobson said.
Slowing down the industry is likely to throw oil into the fire for analysts expecting further monetary or tax stimulus to be implemented.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August production overview of purchasing managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Manufacturers in the eurozone are having a very complicated life right now because rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add even more uncertainty to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected the trade - and this, in particular, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially those that are costly.
He said that as “even more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the horrors of the occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, thousands of people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
Over the course of the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of them children.
We went back to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school rape.
Just ten years after the horrific occupation of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy brought the East and the West together, which in this catastrophic disaster led to action and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school's atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted misfortune, even if the memory of hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined school gymnasium
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dimitri Belyakov as she only tries to get back into the bombed-out school gym after a bomb went off in her underwear.
Confused Aida was desperately searching for her mother Larissa, now in her 40s.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I had blood on my legs.
I got up and went back to find my mother.
A soldier saved her.
After a few surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have another operation.
There were pieces of debris left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jerry Gapoev, were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the capture, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet, as I climb out of the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie on the floor and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid that she was dead, he ran, and on the way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child's hand, and ran with a spray of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me his mother was dead.”
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in the hospital with her leg injured, and on the contrary, she thought her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the late News of the World), where Tony Blair and his wife Cherie were declared winners of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are fading.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We're saying they stayed at the gym.
On a trip to London I remember well, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the toy store, and how I drove a convertible.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where he and his friends are suffering just as much because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
"I feel very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horror," says Damir, who took part in volunteer activities at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember that silence right after the attack, there were no children anywhere screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers his journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir having a taste for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they get bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet guy, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates and he goes to the gym from time to time and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw away all his guns or other weapons at play. Damir is 17 today, he is taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my boy had no chance of surviving this hell.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our life goes on unlike any other.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivor of Beslan Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the attack in 2004, right Grigory today
When he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, his bloody face was filled with fear.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of cruelty in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, took him to school on his first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists entered the court, so my boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not entirely alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it’s harder to think and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened long ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still Recurring Memories: Grigorije's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day when Grigory was so excited to go to school, he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he was alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there is even a statue of weeping Gregory.
Grigory doesn't like to look at the picture and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand that, but I also think that thanks to this image, people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, it takes decades.
It had an effect on my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates that they killed.
That's why, as September 1st approaches, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
First, I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I threw over my head.
Now I'm older and it's been said that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006 I went to a psychologist and then I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on his laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is great and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I’m fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally.
But still, for health reasons, I couldn’t go in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it was not possible.
My next favorite is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished the second year there.
Learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It is not something that children should know about and not something that they should experience at all.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain here will continue.
It's inside, and it's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I will be attending the memorial ceremonies.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me, there's footprints everywhere in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but he carries on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say I've already overcome that fear by 50%, but it can't be completely overcome and forgotten.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
A lot of our friends and neighbors were killed during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift that God could have given me, but I am pained by the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could just pick up all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is taken to a safe Russian special commando (left).
Now she is ten (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all
The world took a breather in 2004 when a Russian policeman took little Alyona out of Beslan in his arms.
The terrorists released her, but kept her thirty-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara captive in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and they have a daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom they named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, does not remember the attack at all and has grown out of it a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary recalls.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact one such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration with a few photographers, all of them cost less than $350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next, set the camera according to the type of photos or videos you’ll be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your gear.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others for 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them will not work.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly seen underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
Always take more pictures.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of shots with a slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper submersion, the light is significantly dimmed.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos – the deeper you dive, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That’s great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmed light.
This is especially important when shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and diseases, the patients treated in the overwhelming majority are interested in something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt out of energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found he was impatient and included his wife Juliet with remorse.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had been skiing in the French Alps for two weeks.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the sternum or if the lung protrusion.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos — a building fiber material that was previously referred to as “miracle,” but is now known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even at the time when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in a different era today hardly seems to be a cause for concern.
But such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, the mesothelioma epidemic is on the rise in the UK today.
The number of deaths from mesothelioma is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we only now feel its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for the mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not concern only veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes we live in, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, Mesothelioma does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London’s commercial houses to public schools do not constitute a shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where they should be treating us are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even consider isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who were in Guy's Hospital and who then showed mesothelioma in the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 of that year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
Now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will suffer from the same disease?”
According to the leading British expert on the mesothelioma of Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic occurs in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them have no idea that they are going to die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory look at the files in the court archives, which are often referred to by persons with disabilities and require compensation, shows how much the Mesothelioma disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had negligently exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the company's flagship store on Oxford Street in two clothing section stores.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
He has two children who are now over 20.
"Before it happened," he says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, I hardly knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my dreams that he would touch me in any way.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
It got its name due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most often, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings today.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, yet the EU and the WHO consider it a “major health risk” that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is compelling but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
Marsk & Spencer Employee Exposed to Asbestos in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pet points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exhibition is due to the "common use and ventilation" of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that they are safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows that even the people in the centre of the government don’t have to guess that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that service elevators and pipes outside parliamentary committee rooms are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something as harmless as “a strong stream of air.”
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament’s Directorate of Services insisted that Westminster Palace receive a “positive medical certificate”, it is now expected that it will take the premises one million pounds and several years of work to be thoroughly inspected by Parliament, electricity will be modernized and asbestos will be removed from the premises in 2015.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One of the people who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of having been exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos was proven," he says, "but in my case I can't prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a cold.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly, I was shaken.
It came all at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the buttocks, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe that it was a mesothelioma.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him an X-ray of his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed in.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came to the operating room and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between his chest and lung prolapse.
I'm optimistic.
I tend not to take much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn't worry too much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipe,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Thus, Mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have a risky profession.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes were found in hospitals in the basement, so it was unlikely that patients would be at risk.
However, staff members who walked through underground corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground dining rooms (like often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos has been removed to this day.
Pupils build Bunsen kahan on asbestos mats
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website has been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a lot of homes,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember was in the 1970s when she was tearing down a garden house.
So be careful how you demolish the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while for that to happen," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized I was going to have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live to see another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling puzzled by the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have left?’
I was told it was 12 months.
I remember thinking to myself, “Well, I’m not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive — breathing itself — is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers inhale, they can settle in the chest, lung lining.
Asbestos fibers irritate the sternum and can cause a cell mutation.
“The problem is the needle-shaped inhaled asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and has treated other patients who have been exposed to asbestos probably during hospital practice.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “lonely breathing pushes them to the edge where the spleen is located.
By its very nature, it has been invasive since the beginning.
On mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly discussed.
According to some, it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the chest," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer “does not respond well to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but does not cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual supporter and advisor for people equally affected.
When they called, he happily introduced himself: "Hello, you called the cancer center."
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would likely only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give it up.
But Lawson “was able to show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the Department of Chest Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a claim and they would have to approve the payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, money is a key issue for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail in the end, many patients face other financial custodians — about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they turn to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we are faced with the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan it was not a "full-fledged settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Reducing exposure to deadly asbestos to one company or place of work — usually decades after it happened — has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or collapsed.
The evidence of the insurance has been lost.
And those who are defending themselves now have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been passed this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to seek redress, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally give them as compensation - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 successful applications are expected to be processed.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is a “good job.”
"It's an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time had not intervened and people with mesothelioma would be able to track down former employers and normally sue them.
Even Mike Penning, a former minister of labor and social affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering too much and they need help right away," Penning said in December last year during a second reading of the Mesothelioma Act.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdun surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - triple therapy, in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott strengthened it.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections did not show any symptoms of the disease.
I went for another check in March [2014].
In my chest I had a few spots [cancers].
My fiftieth birthday is coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
Drink it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no signs of a tumor in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face these kinds of conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not relieved by hope or merely an indication of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) an unpleasant certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma is not life threatening.”

Prohibition of the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for health damage resulting from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to have a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
In the UK, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
The Mesothelioma Act comes into force in the UK.
A $350 million compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos continues to be used as a cheap building material.
World production stands at two million tonnes per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters promise revenge
China’s parliament, despite mounting discussions about democratic reform, on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
The move is likely to trigger long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to expel any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it angered us," Democratic Party Chairwoman Emily Lau said.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to people in Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong’s leadership elections would cause “chaos.”
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to Hong Kong, Beijing has promised that starting in 2017, citizens will be able to vote in executive power.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but it also makes clear that Chinese leaders are firmly in control of the nomination process of the committee, which is tightly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw one of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are backed by the Occupy Central movement with love and peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks, the waves of protests will begin.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as a last step if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We must announce with regret that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement all day, strengthening the protection of the government's headquarters on Sunday and deploying police and barricades.
Instigation of unrest is, according to many Hong Kongers, a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing competition in products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being swayed by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say that their demonstrations threaten the trade - the lifeboat of Hong Kong.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people are involved and for how long,” says political activist Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm the investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong portray as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists staged an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 participants – more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
A pre-choice agitator?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
About 1,600 amateur athletes play a small kick in the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina.
And their highest competition is newly named Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that went into the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka is the head of a small mining company in Jihlava.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
The situation around the first league of small diggers was already dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava city council and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, the little digger won around a million crowns, according to the city’s website.
This year, it’s in the hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the small-scale procedure is not contrary to the law or the directives of the Magistrate.
The situation is, however, an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the Magistrate.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as little support in the elections of one political party, this will probably not work.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the high-level "big" football.
That the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional takeover, the ODS division or the KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 might be created.
And the class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from a number of companies to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrz<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the regional football association.
The head of small football of the other party and the movement will not let into the name of the league
According to the players of the small dugout, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, changing rooms and a social facility.
"For example, the Na Stoup<0xC3><0xBD>ch pitch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lapes from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech mill.
But there will be, for example, in my opinion, a meaningless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small digger uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD> and Na Stoup<0xC3><0xBD>, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a huge progress has been made for a small dig in recent years," Ermazal added.
Other political parties in the name of the league will not appear, according to Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ky.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us, we will no longer give the other one there," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider this at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Vold<0xC3><0xA1>n, a member of the city's sports committee.
"But whether voters evaluate whether Mr. Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka is using the association Little Died Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - first-timers can fly a jet plane
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression when arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security page.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to haul their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
With our VIF (very important fresher - very important fresher) variants this year, we are looking forward to ensuring that students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
A spokesperson for the company said that since the services have just been launched, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve that.
The National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can’t keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists take a stand against racism and police behaviour after events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up, chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to enforcing reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With growing tensions in the Midwest drawing the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of whites is 100% focused on the breed.
Compared to the reactions of blacks soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "The White Woman's Thought of Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
However, according to Perez, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there's a lot of people in the feminist movement who would talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt that what had happened had to be expressed.
This is characteristic of the crisis that we are facing, because [the Ferguson situation] is so racially biased that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Professor of English at Ohio State University Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it will get 150 characters from people all over the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the coloreds are trapped in their own country, it is deafening silence.
"How is it possible for a woman to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?" she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no such thing as race or gender dichotomy.
According to her, black people could not afford to divide these problems clearly: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today combine the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost all cases of white rape,” Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the co-operation of white women.
According to Hattery, the divide between whites and blacks came when suffragettes like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote – women or blacks.
"They've decided to bet on women's suffrage and blacks' suffrage to focus on later," Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why women of color don’t believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped blacks protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they began organizing against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black people first spoke out for help.
According to Mitchell, the outrage of white feminists over the issues that have been raised in Ferguson – the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” with the issues that blacks have faced for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these [traditional feminism] spaces took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who have made a career of fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what it means.
Notable feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead in a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest racism more forcefully.
“I hope that women who have different, yet similar, reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and opinions about race that differ significantly in public opinion polls — will strive for change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America are muddled by some people.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but comments by the Steinem Party of Ferguson face criticism it has raised earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother's Keeper to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked outrage among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism’s interest.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied youths this year in the southwest of the country, the issue of immigration law reform has resurfaced - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercadova, co-chairman of We Belong Together, a women’s advocacy organization for immigration law reform, said that in order to be able to present the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"They speak for themselves," Mercadova said.
Since most work permits are granted to men, the women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organizations," she said.
Pig housing in Ipswich for sale
The real estate office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it rested on it in the living room of the pig.
The one-bedroom detached house, which is for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
Informational photographs included a picture of the living room, in which he rests with his head on the pig's couch.
Real estate agency Connells said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
"The photo was found there by mistake, and that's why it's already been removed," a spokesman for the office said.
In information about the property, Connells real estate described the former prayer house as "the only separate one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
Harvey's lottery player gets a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in south-east Perth, with one lucky man taking $1.1 million from Saturday's sweep of the lottery home.
It was the second time in five years that traffic in Harvey had been lucky, the last time in November 2009 it was a $1 million win.
But the lucky winner has yet to sign up.
Steve Forward, the owner of the store, said he was talking about a win for the entire city in southwestern Perth.
This is the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought a similar win was to the touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one win last month, ending a couple of happy weeks.
Last weekend, the Canning Vale player became one of the five August millionaires and just a few weeks earlier, a couple in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for twenty years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not leave in the evening.
Engineers want higher wages.
In a press release, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it had voluntarily chosen a time outside the traffic peak.
The GDL takes into account the chosen time of the strike many people who return from the weekend on the railway only during the first working day.
At the same time, we are also thinking of people who come to work during the day," the union said in a press release Monday morning announcing the strike.
"Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less already passengers," GDL added.
DB has not yet published an official response to the strike.
It is not clear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including the Czech Republic.
Trade unions are demanding a five percent increase in the salaries of engine operators and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
At present, the average salary of the drivers varies depending on the years worked between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
DB engineers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuse to accept the increase in wages as working hours are reduced.
They stress, however, that the wage assessment of the drivers must be developed in the same way as that of the other railway staff, for which DB does not count towards shortening the working week.
There was a danger that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was a defect in the material.
The car was brand new, so I didn’t think anything like that would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been repaired provisionally and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we were going straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more ersets and it didn't work out.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you've passed five speed tests.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the vint.
It was all due to the fact that we had been piping the car for more than half a year to get it to some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You blew it up so you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work did not come to nothing.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought of was not achieved.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops to retire prematurely from the fight for the championship.
He also lost to foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Are you surprised that so many of your favorites are gone?
Oh, yeah.
It was a shame for the spectators, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus, for whom you are planning a car, has been at the top for a long time.
But he added that he flew out of the track and scored a nearly two-minute deficit.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the stages of the winners.
He went through the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we bought the car well.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular participant of rally races?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I still didn't stick to it.
I decided to take her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance in a year, I'll probably go for it.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did you enjoy it?
To a certain extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What is waiting for you after Barumce?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow from us for this race the Fabia Honz S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
With Mira we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you suggest something?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was in the World Championship, you reached your peak in the series in fifth place.
Doesn't it make you want to try the track again?
It doesn't.
An oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a doctor’s certificate of incapacity for work, which serves as proof for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the given days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was made only orally.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have written confirmation of the employer’s consent to take a leave, in practice this procedure has proven to be a good practice.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take the leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence from work may be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, therefore the reason for immediate termination of employment according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the case of a legal dispute about an agreement with the employer, you thus lack evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, only you have the days indicated in the cover letter as an unexcused absence.
An unexcused absence in a cover letter does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. inability to take material security in unemployment), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there was an accident, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not a so-called "incompetent", it is only a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the aforementioned document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as the early notification to the employer or the request for written consent to take a leave.
This way, you avoid any possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
Returning to the track ended up for Tony Stewart just behind half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race track.
Stewart hit the road for the second time after his right front tyre broke in lap 172, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car into the garage, didn't speak to reporters, and left.
His team boss Chad Johnston said the No. 14 team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I wish we had a better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart ran into a paycheck for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required a repair to the right side of his car.
"We put a lot of hope into today's race for a good finish," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York City, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch a spot in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into the tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
Officials said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least two more weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion was warmly encouraged before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he finished 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd lap, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner and ran into Stewart, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi operator, will earn 12.3 million euros
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new taxi service station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until now, the taxi driver has collected 150,000 crowns per year for the same seats.
Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used lotteries when choosing administrators.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the amount of the offer is decided.
"One year after the termination of the original lease agreements and the opening of the selection procedures, it has been proven that the new lease system is far more advantageous and generally fairer for Prague," the mayor said.
The most expensive spot is on the Pershing
The highest price was offered by those interested in living in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
It will pay 2.1 million crowns per year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid for seats in front of the Municipal House or in Wenceslas Square.
The new rental rules for taxis were adopted by the city council in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they cancelled the original leases.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We released it all the time, creating a practically second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Sava in there.
Unbelievable fluff!
Our well in the basement has always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it was not someone who was expertly made, the grandfather worked it out with his own help.
It's been a long time.
She was only three-screw and totally peculiar, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, the water didn’t smell.
We were wondering if something had gone wrong.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible with a bit of luck, the board did not linger there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, nothing was visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we let her go again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
On the ground lay a glued package with some bones.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a squirming mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where there are vents, grandfather's invention, were the remains of fish!
And hard to eat!
Our cellar is also unique.
Someone would say that Grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and floor are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is knocked down.
Mostly ships are there.
And the car.
And a beach lounger.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone walked in one piece.
At the ceiling several of the already mentioned vents.
Without a net, the birds usually fly there and build their nests on the beams.
There is no point in mentioning mice.
Grandpa wanted to make it airy, and that's it.
The air didn’t help either.
The whole basement smelled.
We also cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, a heraclitus board, and so on.
Our remote cottage was greeted with a passing disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could have dragged the disgusting remains in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
She'd be hard-pressed to come to us for a snack.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not all right.
What if he's the one who blew the French out of us?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, he's got them.
We decided to monitor the cellar and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing, before the tests were done, but that was good.
Pulling water from a forest well isn't something I'd like to do for a long time.
We once heard our bitch's terrible anxious barking.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long strong black hose in the grass next to the veranda.
Reza jumped over her and whistled like a madman.
Her mother had her out because she thought Réza had dug a waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, however, the hose partially rolled into the club and partially receded.
There was a sneeze on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran down.
The raven, long and fat as a bull, was about to swallow a huge toad, and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When the hatchet saw the excess in the form of our whole family, it must have thought that we should eat it when we were so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the passageway into the cellar.
We were flying after her.
She leaped for the well like lightning.
By the way, we noticed another smelling package on her plate.
It smells like fish.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shady.
We closed the store for a day.
That he would...
We went out and there we each lay to one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It was embarrassing for the well.
At first, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on the neck.
Then a whole loop sprang up on the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to penetrate inside.
Fired employee retaliated, bought laptops at the company and sold them
A disgruntled employee, after being released, bought a computer at a computer company and then sold it.
He was able to spend the money before the arrest of the police.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers in twelve cases for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After the takeover, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner, chief commissioner of the Schumper police.
The motive for the fraud was the employer's revenge for the dismissal and also the profit of the money.
"He told us at the hearing that he used the money to pay off the loans," Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner said.
The police also found that the fraudster is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in prize machines or in video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money with him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster who was once convicted of theft now faces up to five years in prison.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaars, which bought laptops under the price and sold them, are also at risk of punishment.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made some changes.
The biggest change was the route that brought the destination to the flood, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photos and made videos together.
To get my perspective on the other side to perfection, I took on the role of a personal guide.
Together with my friend Katya, we obediently lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We said good-bye to our friends who were walking around us to the faster runners sector.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of jumps to warm up, turn on the sports testers, countdown and start!
Screams of joy, but instead of a quick start followed a dash to the starting line.
After five minutes, we arrive at the gate, turn on the meter and start at ten o'clock.
We cross the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, run their first race.
So far, they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad almost a quirky touch.
The pulsating meat stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has how much power.
A slight hill on Palack<0xC3><0xBD> Square forces many runners to slow down or go for a walk.
Just before I go to the Theatre I see a police escort and immediately after him V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B> flies at an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the awe-inspiring sighs of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the line, encourage him, he's going to clap with me, but just before that, my leg is going to go down and our hands are going down.
The Theatrical Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
There are places in front of us where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the M<0xC3><0xA1>nes bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
There are moments of truth in the first breath.
At the crossing of the road Katya skobrtn<0xC3><0xAD>ch about the curb and shows the jump float.
I watch if she doesn't need help, and I run a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and continues along the Koz<0xC3><0xA1> Street, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, although at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but nevertheless it is necessary to closely monitor the surroundings.
I still don’t know if the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate we are frantically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I recommend it to Kat, too, because ten cheers with fans is like half an energy bar.
The fact is, it's working, we're speeding up again, and even though we've fallen pretty badly, now the chase has begun.
We pass dozens of runners, when I pass someone particularly tired, I try to encourage him a few words: "Come on, a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one's ahead of us with the last ice cream, we're speeding up.
So far we have been running for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but it really needs to be loosened.
The sun is slowly setting and the end of the day symbolically ends the race.
The last exit to the bridge, the turn and just a straight line to the finish.
The pace at which we're running, I wonder where this girl is going?
"Come on, let's go under 1 3 o'clock, let's go!" I call.
We try it, we sprint, and that's the goal.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
Close to the goal, Kat breaks her legs, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-executed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target area.
Euphoria does not allow us to think about the pusher in the passageways to the dressing rooms.
Here it can be seen that Goat Street was not the narrowest place.
This is all the way to the end of the flood, which is under the pressure of almost ten thousand runners packed to burst.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not a place for them.
I also lose my mind after a while and wonder if the beautiful views and, compared to previous flights, the more interesting route was worth what is happening in the destination.
From my own experience, I know that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route has shown runners many interesting places, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere in the Yellow Spa was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track, as well as random spectators, scaled it on every metre of the track.
Unfortunately, during the city run the historic center has to count on obstacles that can not be removed, but the goal of the mass race in a place that is bordered on one side by the wall and on the other by the river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I consider it very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you say about the situation in the destination.
Bulgarian Prison Guards Organize Protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reinstatement of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
The guards of the month symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"The meeting is still going on," said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of the Prison Service.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why can the universe have more dimensions and we don't see them?
Physicists usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University made the 1999 hit in black.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the density of problems that a number of theoretical physicists deal with today - an attempt to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The basic physical problem between the two key theories (because at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been solved and is being solved so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene has dealt with the complex material so fresh and engaging that he cannot be blamed for how interesting he has not included in his book.
In addition, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, the author would not object to the fact that his book was aging faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything essential that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the next few years it will be a bit more lively in this area (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go full throttle) and so it is a good time to enter the non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound crazy, fantastical, strange, or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our gaze for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more earthy, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine pulling a hundred-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scene from half a kilometer away (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long hose stretched in the horizontal direction, but if you do not suffer from sharpness, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Because of its great distance from the hose, you would think that the ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will only answer them with one data: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a distance of half a kilometer, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can in fact move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the hour hands", that is, around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where there is on the circle wrapping the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the casing of the hose is short, "turned" and worse noticeable.
To realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, twisted and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we did not just pretend to reveal the "turned" dimension covering the thickness of the hose.
Just take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal the twisted dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he expressed the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by providing an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises, how does this Kaluz observation come together with the obvious fact that we see exactly three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly pronounced and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the length of the hose, our universe also has large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at every moment.
But, analogously to the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can also have an additional dimension, firmly screwed into a space so small that so far it has remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzov's remarkable proposal, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that we draw a fairly dense series of circles on the perimeter of the hose with a black color.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now thanks to the drawing, we will reveal the curved dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little, let us note the illustrations in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in the same way as we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are twisted into a sufficiently small space; thus we explain that we have not yet directly observed them.
The square grid represents the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circle represents a new, tiny and curved dimension.
Just like the loops of thread in a densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - just for the sake of visibility, we have drawn them only into the intersections in the square grid.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space – the ordinary world around us – in such ordinary scales as the meters, shown on the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each subsequent image, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing strange happens, as we see at the first few levels of magnification.
However, when we move on to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, curved dimension in the shape of a circle, similar to a string in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at each point in the direction of large dimensions in the same way as the tube has a circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some regularly spaced points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much more difficult than observing the obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact reveal it beyond the power of our most modern enlargement tools.
Most important, however, is that the additional dimension is not just a rounded sphere within the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the top-down, left-right, and front-back independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the three usual ones still in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, then, we find that even though we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein’s thinking that this does not exclude the existence of additional curved dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
We can hardly observe a smaller curved dimension.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension might be about the size of one Planck length, far beyond the distinctiveness of today’s instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to practice an electric guitar: part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" consists in a twelve-act harmonic form, which you can repeat arbitrarily.
Anyone who falls into music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honz Homolk Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppeteer and a puppeteer, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic designer since graduating twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnout, which unfortunately cannot be left out.
He is a guitarist for his father, as well as his brother Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j, the leader of Wohnout.
Start with training on a single string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the shape again.
You just have to listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it is already starting to sound.
If you add a third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, pay attention to the change of tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza goes back to the pentatonic and you try to put it together with twelve.
So practice it honestly.
Best of all, you can read about it in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits the castle Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k
We take the point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home," said the striker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
You weren't nervous playing him, were you just accompanying him with a huge whistle?
I didn’t notice it in any particular way, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
The penalty was settled after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, a corner came out of it and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were the better team that had the better chance.
Why did it change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well until the break after the cashed goal.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also probably true that the locals said something about their game about the break, perhaps they were not very happy with it.
You only scored on the opponent's field for the first time, while at home you may not have even scored a goal.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, it's more up to us how we fight it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's another category.
Four matches you were waiting for the goal, were you not afraid that after the last match it may be similar?
It may not be, but of course we are glad that since the last match we have not had to listen to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from kilometers of distant crater.
The lava flowing to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnaj<0xC3><0xB6>kull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a kilometer-long crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact is now of greatest concern to scientists...
The situation remains unchanged for the time being.
From yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still escapes from the fissure approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50x bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open in places where it is under ice.
If this were to happen, in addition, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the J<0xC3><0xB6>kuls<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC3><0xA1> Fj<0xC3><0xB6>llum river and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption there is a strong smell of sulfur, from the crack rise clouds of steam and gases.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmv<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB0>uh<0xC3><0xA1>ls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there is also much more gas,” says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann H<0xC3><0xB6>skuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the early hours of the morning there was almost no wind.
Traces of a sandstorm were washed away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (second highest) applies to B<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow grade (third) applies to Askja.
The sky above the Chebe belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Flying day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, the aircraft acrobat Peggy Valentinov<0xC3><0xA1> was introduced, who climbed from the cockpit to the railing on the upper wing of the two-plane and also between the wings.
There it is referred only to muscle strength.
This year’s aviation day in Cheb was held for the fifth time and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting aviation pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport took place not only "walking on wings" by the German acrobat Peggy Valentinov<0xC3><0xA1>, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his bright veil.
The acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to be promoted.
However, due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the flight days program.
Peggy gets off the cockpit on the upper wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, she moves into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day described.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the mainstay of the show, then Mustang's next performance was a famous cherry on the cake.
Legendary fighter raced on the surface with Grippeny of the Army of the Czech Republic in suspension (so-called on numbers).
Such a set could be seen by aviation fans in the Czech Republic for the first time.
The pilot Miroslav S<0xC3><0xA1>zavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never took part in it.
He was included in the Army Reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing plane.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
At the same place is another pearl of the Cheb aviation day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a powerful machine didn't go unnoticed.
Its polished aluminum coating glowed in the distance.
The machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French Air Force was also admired.

Lucie Borhyov<0xC3><0xA1>: Dramatic comeback in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhy exchanged parental concerns for at least tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde presenter obviously does not know any of this.
After all, the moderated TV news she did well, as if she had not stopped with him for two months at all!
It’s only two weeks since blondes ended their sixth trimester, during which women experience the greatest stress after childbirth.
However, Lucie will not appear in TV Nova’s main news conference on a regular basis.
According to Blesk.cz, a regular return is expected within a month.
Her daughter, Linda, now needs her more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibitions for the year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, plans to say goodbye to J<0xC3><0xA1>gr
It would be a good thing if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called The Golden Match, in which a stunning Nagan team met again.
Even the players who took part in the gold hat trick.
Players should have a taste, right?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one or two days can be found during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>légro) or Be<0xC4><0x91>a <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (the organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey play-off?
So when I get there...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and in representation they are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performances are crucial, especially at the World Championships.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagan encounter?
The meeting with the players was great.
A man revived his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it is good to recall the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which was really worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echm<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the alternator.
Do you remember your first team match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Hol<0xC3><0xAD>k and Robert Reichel, we were in the same troika.
It was everyone’s first start.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that's impossible to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was captured for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hasan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can't (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized J<0xC3><0xA1>gra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
Hnili<0xC4><0x8D>ka also performed well.
At the same time, he was training with me once a night and there was a hole.
And now he's caught famously.
First the United States and then the Netherlands, football players start qualifying
Prominent guests flocked to the NH Hotel in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov on Monday morning.
People could see goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, representative coach Pavel Vrbu...
And there, that character in a black cap, that's Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
The Arsenal defender and the captain of the national team arrived at the meeting about half a dozen of the last.
We have a great game against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said as he appeared in front of reporters.
Programme of the Czech national team
Monday, September 1st: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday, September 2nd: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramm<0xC3><0xA1>da (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of match
Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> and spol. can support fans even before Wednesday's match against the USA (20:15).
The representative office for them opened Tuesday training, which starts at 18:30 at Letn<0xC3><0xA1>.
And it will be followed by an autograph, which neither Rosicky nor Czech will be missing.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.
This is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we are going to focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage if you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that haven’t been done in a long time,” said Vrba, who has been leading the national team since January.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The national team has three matches under Vrbo, all preparatory.
With Norway and Finland, she drew 2:2 and lost 1:2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
Not until now.
In a match with the Netherlands, he will start qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, the Czech team would help if it could also manage a general against the United States.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think in order to be successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player with a twenty-three-member nomination who has health problems is striker David Lafata.
He's suffering from a fever.
If he didn’t make it to Wednesday’s game against the U.S., Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how, after a poor diagnosis for many years, she thought she would die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that in the UK, about 23,000 people suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, restless walking and twisted toes.
Patients may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA), a disease that had a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be chained to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer.
I could never ride rollerblades or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied at school for the way I walked and ran.
When Rodgers was thirteen and after several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor had left the room and looked at her documentation, where she learned she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was stalking, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime, I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was all alone, and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you're sick, or you'd be in a wheelchair.
I think it’s going to be a lot less life-threatening.”
After a few genetic tests, he was found to have CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT is, I thought I was a lucky kid,” she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness about CMT to draw attention to this disease.
Washington Businessmen: With the Turn of the Economy, Taxes Are Raised
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of companies in the country with accelerating economic recovery last year rose slightly and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businessmen in Maryland and Virginia combined in fiscal 2013 took $27.6 billion into state and local treasuries, up 3.8% from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Last year’s tax burden – both state and local – rose 4.3% to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year, and was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes fell.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local levies by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56%, is from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from corporations.
Virginia, at 28%, has the relatively lowest tax revenue from business.
The researchers argue that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate owned by companies, which increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of growth of -1 percent.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2 percent year-on-year from $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in real estate value does not push up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from business cannot be attributed only to the healing real estate market.
According to the data, the income from the business also seems to be increasing.
Companies in the region have announced a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Even though they are heading in the same direction, local business tax burdens are not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was nationwide, at 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of 6% of all three districts (all of which have the same tax rate).
Maryland’s corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975 percent.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet income targets in the coming year, the income tax rate set by law in 2017 could be reduced to up to 3%.
According to a recent study, small business owners in Washington are doing better, and so are paying higher state and local taxes.
The labor tax levied on small business owners as a personal income tax — the structure of compensation for rising costs by raising prices, according to which most companies are organized — in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than others.
The researchers argue that the trend and nationwide increases in trade tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments increasing to 6.2% compared to the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind others, because cutting government spending is taking its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorossiysk
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government units have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine, according to him, is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he can not say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a form of further strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, he decided on the eve of the EU summit.
Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent president of the member states, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions are to be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new president of the European Union.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected at a summit of the European Union to head the European Council, the so-called President of the European Union, which runs summits of member states.
He will be replaced by Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini at the head of European diplomacy.
Italy, which will become the vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
Help an incurable and long-term suffering patient with a death?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legally possible.
Nevertheless, according to the statement of the doctors who contacted the LN, they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter of neurology, says doctor about sclerosis

We don’t know 100% if it will be successful.
But if we don’t try, we won’t find out,” says Radim Mazanec, a motor neurologist.
There's a CIA manuscript in it, they needed a war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Stanislav Huml has made it clear who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "hard sanctions, which were announced with regard to the shooting down of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead, were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
In addition, according to the legislator, the CIA’s handwriting is known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and the parties are again offering the impossible.
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for each family and a cable car over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are squandering who the voters like the most.
The server Lidovky.cz has chosen unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkirk.
A thorough siege has begun.
It was on August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka constantly asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side finally complied and included this ground force as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkirk, which remained in the power of the German troops.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Don’t hurry and get some sleep.
The last days of vacation are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage to a normal working pace can be for many nuts.
It can even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with the changed situation: do not rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers Family: "We're Keeping Fingers"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was taken to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter said today that she is not losing hope that the 80-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're holding her thumbs.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency department said she had a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious".
Reactions to themselves did not last long, including the incredible support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is overturned subtitles
The fact that the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And that’s a fact that has been bothering me a lot lately, the word of annoyance is more accurate.
This applies in particular to the articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It’s called “Israel Attacked Gaza.”
Only in the text you will read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This is followed by the headline "Both sides broke the armistice".
Does the journalistic community realize that by this process they are directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing all over Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been 60 years since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of "Jewish swine" and similar confidence, I was crushed.
Is this what the world wants to end what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that after the Jews they were destined to liquidate the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please give a little more care to your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy."
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decided to liquidate the Czech nation and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, they will tell you why they would do it.
In Israel they have a job, social security and top-notch healthcare (I myself have seen for myself how the top private Hadassah hospital, which is funded by the sponsorship of Jews from all over the world, is usually run by Arabs and is of course treated there).
Hamas is also targeting its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And not condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Inform about the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Please note that Hamas aims to liquidate the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of killing innocent Arab children.
Please note that Hamas is on the list of the world’s terrorist organizations.
Please be informed that in the nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which, of course, the administrators of Gaza do not pay, and even get angry that at this time, sometimes the supply of electricity is interrupted.
If Hamas did not invest money in the construction of underground tunnels so that they could penetrate suicide bombers in the territory of Israel, but perhaps in the construction of apartment houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Monday morning’s information claim: An online retailer — video producer and hundreds of other things — is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google looked like a billion sure, and this connection looked like a natural one.
Twitch, which was founded by Justin.tv just three years ago, was poised to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who streamed online game streams to it — the words Business Insider “YouTube for live streaming gaming.”
Twitch interface.
On YouTube there are already popular videos "Let's play", a kind where the wise (mostly older) give games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to shock a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch, did not excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how the established company will pay off the potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Twitch CEO Emmet Shear said: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us achieve it faster.
Another mystery is - frankly - the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim that sports are better than watching, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about playing games instead of just watching real games.
It’s one thing to watch a friend over his shoulder at three in the morning playing Resident Evil, and it’s another thing to watch someone else get twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for how to get a headache.
I admit that the speed run games in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic era finish the game in record time is fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of acting or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is the fourth-highest on the internet.
How exactly will Amazon use this?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch blending into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed it.
But Twitch has something every company wants to attract: hordes of young men who want advertisers.
According to Twitch director Shear, both Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of gaming” and the media don’t seem to be giving up, nor do they seem to be – swallowing – viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Attached is the original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that is contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Who will you believe?
The Word of God or the Word of Man?
It is as if human inquiry were nothing compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine to have.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to the "word of God," they refer to the myths about God written by people.
If there really is an intelligent one with a creator for some purpose, then it is he who has created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who has invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who has added the next series of evidence to the evolutionary record to show it exclusively.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, they can tell stories.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "driven" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but these texts were not written by anyone but mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the <0xC3><0xBC>ber-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size had ever written a book, there would have been only one such book, one holy scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the use of human authors could not compare with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and it would reveal deep morals and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to the unity of the common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all are constantly falling apart into ever more separate denominations, seeking the disputed truths, and each in some way claiming the guidance of God, regardless of the continuing distraction and distraction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h's Words of the Kit<0xC3><0xA1>b-i-Akd<0xC3><0xA1>s, the Avesta of Zarathustra, the Sikh Ad<0xC3><0xAD>-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be true "gods" and are considered to be "gods".
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the road to some extent.
None of the books mentioned above has any advantage over the others.
None of them has any evidence support and none of them can be confirmed historically.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I’m not saying I’ve proven the Bible to be reliable and historically accurate.
Of course he isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologetics (defenses) because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive notions once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate abomination instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy—with each also being able to contain a prophecy that was not fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions, and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and contradictions of the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We have to point out again that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not an eyewitness account!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources for the Pentateuch alone, i.e., the five Books of "Moses" and Moses do not attribute the authorship to any of them, since it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents were refiltered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as the believer thinks.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese and Egyptian.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docetics and the Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into some sort of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were scattered and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young religion of Moses, the New Testament authors decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "Lord of the Mountain", changed to Belzebub "Lord of the Fly".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the House of Nicaea.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected simply by raising their hands, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The manner in which the canon developed depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers of the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Jerusalem Church?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
Thus the core of the canon thus developed out of the narrowness of the original Church.
So the council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referred to by approved books.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer us to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mixture of renown, parable, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightened, quite the contrary!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically entirely wrong, no matter what it is from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic wand to spray someone with blood, it would cure him of leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi was a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows something about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal story, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.

To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God’s will.
Creationists, however, still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then the reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their favorite books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “the worship of creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God Himself, and even insist that the rejection of their supposedly “holy” books somehow disproves God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God is a liar.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate doctrine from divinity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are HIS Word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly "unchangeable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and distorted by merely erring people.

Participant of the bucket challenge knocked out the jaw
As she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts of the United Kingdom screamed that she had damaged her facial bone structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work.
The woman was hospitalized after yelling at a cell phone call by clenching her jaw.
While pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so loudly that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw began to stiffen,” she told The Mirror.
A 20-year-old girl pours water on herself.

I tried to close my mouth, but it couldn't, it was jammed, and I realized something was going on.
Then it happened to me and my sister, they might have laughed, but I had to be quick to the emergency room."
A 20-year-old girl had to be hospitalized to be returned to her jaw after participating in a fashion viral wave on Tuesday.
The video has become an internet sensation, shared on Facebook and Twitter by thousands of people.
Chinese school attacker stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China Agency, violently broke into the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half past eleven o’clock local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen later killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one offspring in line with government policy.

The youngest students took the nine to their class, where they and the teacher waited for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, that's not waiting for you, you're already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed it to the first-year-olds as a gift to the heads.

The new art director of Nova news is David Fiala
David Fiala has been the new art director of news and journalism for Nova since September 1.
He replaces Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since 1 June.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphic department of Z1 news television.
For the last two years, under the direction of Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba, he has participated in the realization of the complete visual transformation of the news reports of Televizn<0xC3><0xAD> noviny, St<0xC5><0x99>epiny, Pr<0xC3><0xA1>sk! and other publicistic programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala manages very well the synergy of communication between the editorial staff, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
He has a sense of typography and pure elegant design, which is the path we want to take in Nova’s news visual,” says Nova’s creative director Alan Z<0xC3><0xA1>ruba.
Apple iCloud allegedly succumbed to hackers, the public got naked pictures of celebrities
A screenshot with a list of missing files
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on the 4chan server is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, the American server Mashable.com has warned.
He allegedly obtained them through unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has yet to comment on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but several of the affected images have already admitted authenticity.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the film series Hunger Games, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played, for example, in Deathtrap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the acquired images and videos to enrich.
The footage reportedly showed interest in American magazines, according to reports on the 4chan server, but the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a real flaw in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that allowed users to obtain passwords to their accounts through the use of raw power, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool worked demonstrably, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
For preventive reasons, iCloud users should change their password associated with Apple ID.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of nude images of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are many times better secured than computers in households or smaller companies, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to move the sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly you will have the space to delete the failed images, so that they will not unnecessarily take up space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Val<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ka in PDF format.
A Smart Way to Save for College Scripts
Since the cost of college scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from high school classmates with an offer of nominal compensation to delay their resale.
“I got a book on calculations, which normally costs $180, for a semester for ten and for chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the university council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options on how to manage these expenses.
Online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s are the preferred choice for students.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the semester book, often with a significant discount, than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of University Stores, less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores.
Here are 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in university bookstores.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost 290 dollars, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one at Chegg.com, in a retail specialized in textbooks, for 239.99 dollars.
Buy used
If you do not mind the comments of other people or wear and tear and destruction, the appropriate option is to use textbooks.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the changes are not significant for the work in the seminars.
If so, older editions may sell for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering the borrowed textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the trade in which you are borrowing the book, including the postage for notes, highlights, or wear and tear and damage.
Please note: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the most favorable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN, because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, advises Gault.
He convinced himself of this on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
It's the same mud.
And then they found in the well torso rifles from the end of the war
The well is located near the church of St. George.
We discovered the growth around and began to pull out the flyover - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we came upon the head," said Radomil Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it to be a torso of German assault rifles used by SS units.
The finding is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
All wooden structural things have decomposed over time, so it is unusable.
Her body, however, is preserved - it maintains its shape.
How did it feel in the well?
There is one explanation.
Perhaps it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably for fear of being pushed away.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't have done it.
They threw weapons into the forest," the finder said.
The rifle was the only thing that enthusiasts of the Autumn Spirit Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them around here, so we slowed the excavation work, we carefully shook the mud so that there was no accident, but there was nothing else down there," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
The discovery will end in the museum’s depository at the castle in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet liberated the captive Czech Republic
Exclusive interview Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz with Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they are - or should be - that Ruban and his counterpart are specifying at the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a retired general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in the anti-government protests in the Maidan.
Yesterday, when we were talking, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of the Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of the pro-Russian separatists is dedicated twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence team estimates their numbers to be in their thirties.
Of course, there can be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated the already captured Serbs, Dagestan, Chechnya, one Swede, Georgia... but not yet the Czech Republic.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive compatriot and could free him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are taken by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in the Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists take them, they will shoot them without mercy after the interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists see these men as mercenaries, and they think you deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers take over a group of Donetsk separatists - including the Czech Republic - they put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna live.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many of you have already managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that correctly, I'll exchange it.
Some sources say that it has already exceeded a hundred men.
A long time ago, we stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just liberated them... they didn't save us from the war if they decided to keep fighting.
The rescuers in the war are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's it.
And every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four, sometimes five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release prisoners and only a human request.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust among the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides of the war?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls."
I'm not offended.
And maybe it also captures the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Corps of Officers, I have already gained some authority.
I never cheat, I never cheat and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhansk one.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even if I'm caught exchanging prisoners... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (a long silence)... both Ukrainians and separatists avoid the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Don side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
Not even a hint that the Ukrainian army is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give the numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officials, as well as veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying for independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their irreconcilable opponents - for life and death.
As we say, they've eaten them through their throats.
The same dreams and desires were revealed by the way on Maidan.
And now I speculate a little: Russia supports the separatists and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be big and the other to be small.
This sentence of mine, however, contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of one of the strongest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and I show the soldiers or the armed men my bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical viewfinder.
The faces of the people who are aiming at me, I see well every time... and they can push the trigger of their weapons at any time.
An aviator, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestry.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small government in a big Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it constantly and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
According to him, such a state should not exist.
At the same time, he is an irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking about the characters - in the Ukrainian TV talk show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred meters of walking, I always get at least five times the fear.
So why should I hide my opinion that Jacenuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk a “rabbit.”
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians an animal from which to go fear or have in others respect and authority.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister he has no right to cry in parliament in war, to beg him, to play with his intrigues, to threaten to take office... he must rule the country, manage it and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister does not have the right to family, friends, rest from crying emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Jacenuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he does not fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Revenue
Sylvester Stallone’s three hitmen returned less than $30 million from the $90 million U.S. budget, and Sin City: The woman I would murder for returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also films for children like How to Train the Dragon 2 were a disappointment for the cinema.
According to the article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, as far as children's films are concerned, their own quality is to blame.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films and called How to Train the Dragon 2 a mere "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of the summer movie premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the change in audience access and the increased popularity of internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was already there.
Unlike the current crisis of Hollywood cashiers, Netflix’s net profit from online services has reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book rights, predicting the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current decline, some commentators claim that there may be something to his disastrous prophecy.
With the release of possible big box office crackers in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in sales simply “cyclical.” He told the Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash-strappers in history and no one will worry about selling.”
The DPRK again threatens Seoul, has launched another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang is located in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
A South Korean defense ministry spokesman said the missiles had been fired from a location in the north-west of the DPRK and had reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea appears to have fired a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media said, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud missiles.
This is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place over the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in the anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
Two youth tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they did not return home, the concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search party including local police and a rescue team was dispatched and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, they were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opava only a point, the win was on the leg Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek
The 23-year-old forward could have decided, but failed in two of his biggest chances.
The goal was mainly called close to three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended on the goalkeeper Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>tonov.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm angry at myself," your little ashtray poured over my head.
"I should've put it up under the lid, it kind of worked for me," he thought.
Sigma's defense didn't allow for this, with the exception of Mikul's 11-minute incursion, which was covered by Reichl.
Then they began to push the Hanaks, but they were not allowed into the block, which prevented them from leaving the house, and he captured the Flower from a distance.
We spent 15 minutes comparing, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the chance Vaz<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not change, and so it ended 0: 0," hated Hanak coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences in the squad, where in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k and three-point shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k were missing, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia.
Unlike their previous policies, this did not allow them to enter.
Substitutes deserve a discharge.
Sigma looked more footbally, but we didn’t let it go to anything except one standard,” said Slezan<0xC5><0xAF> coach Petr Bar<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and fighting.
The draw is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got four points with the draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the head of the club Josef Lébra, who after the defeat with Znojmo conditioned his million-dollar deposit in the box with diametrically different performances in the next matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Leb's warning, so there can be no talk of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, adding to the address of the sleeping shooter Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ka: "I believe that it will come and when he gives the goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first match I will replace him immediately to save goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice been a fan of Venice.
The film festival is going through a crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez I<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xA1>rritu was one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days gave the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice had dropped somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because the Birdman was followed by criticisms of the acclaimed, but less appealing to viewers, films such as the documentary on the genocide in Indonesia of the 1960s.
Heroes of the comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet aroused such crowds as in the past, and it has allegedly ceased to be a problem to get a place at the last minute in the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has hit such prestigious institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also appeared in two films right away.
In the out-of-competition story The Vision, shot by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth’s novel, Pacino, 70, has a role close to his: a celebrity actor who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the very next day as a strange ironworks owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, shot by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Performance should not miss him - but does the artist still need Pacin's format for awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian in particular, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly declares himself to the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italy
This year, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman's first film to be rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in it by the view of the family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director has managed to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actor.
He also took on the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which starred Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who nearly killed her own child with her walk anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception, neither the Redemption for Glory, nor 3 Hearts, both works embracing the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few in the first half of the festival.
And while the festival’s images have depressing themes in common, a new film by Peter Bogdanovich called She’s Funny That Way, a funny comedy set in Venice outside the competition and shot in the style of American cheerleaders of the 1940s, has managed to lift the mood for more than a day.
Police caught four producers of pervitine in Prague, drugs were transported from Poland
"The detectives detained three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who manufactured and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9 from last November to August this year," police spokesman Jana R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> street caught a 24-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who was listed as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer in the group.
The following day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, on the basis of the prior consent of the deputy.
The last of the four police officers were caught in the area of the Malaysian incineration plant on Wednesday morning, August 20," the spokeswoman said.
A woman received one-third of the drugs for the transport of medicines from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of influence.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vova street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and ensured the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Polish Republic.
He weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitine.
A twenty-five-year-old woman, who has not yet been punished, helped him with the transport of medicines from Poland or the sale to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," added R<0xC3><0xB6>ssler.
Criminals also carried out several home inspections on the basis of the judge’s order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, injection syringes, hoses and other devices and objects that according to experts can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police officers found that since 1995 the main organizer has been sentenced seven times in total for property criminal activity, the woman has not been sentenced," the police spokesman added.
The last person arrested in 2006 was convicted of a felony of sexual abuse, and a 37-year-old auto mechanic who is being prosecuted for freedom has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
Even with him, it was mostly for property criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other dealing with narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to a decade in prison.
In the case of three people, the investigator finally submitted an appeal to the public prosecutor for a proposal to impose the detention, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as crucial as that of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.
For example, in Italy, hand-made chess with a 42 x 42 cm board is a good example.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer will receive a set of wooden black and red painted figurines stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
It is not surprising that instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a climbing horse at their disposal.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable gift to you, there is also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (of course by hand) on a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disruption of high school and high school does not make sense.
The Czech Republic has few general educated people and statistics also show that gymnasts have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in schools in the last 14 days.
Mostly it is a routine matter, such as transferring the flower beds from the summer storage room back to the classroom and phasing out the chalk.
They're gonna have a little bigger frmol at the high school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment as well as literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year-old high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice after three years opens and resumes its activity.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by being entered in the register of schools managed by the M<0xC5><0xA0>MT.
“The French Socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Francois Hollande.
Valls calls on the sharply split left to “show its support” for a militant socialist president whose new division of functions was not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, raising his applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge France’s controversial thirty-five-hour work week, despite passionate arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed a law at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to remain "consistent" with the government.
Justice Minister Christiane Taubirov<0xC3><0xA1>, however, made his way through the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having "lost faith in the future because of it."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes between the socialists when she said she did not expect the new Valls government to last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and so is Prince Manuel Valls, who was forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that the party could win early elections and that it was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extreme conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon have patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art no longer limits Prague to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new leadership of the capital.
Other gambling halls will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restriction on dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in the October elections.
"In addition, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends its mandate in a few weeks," said councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several municipalities, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on their territory.
But the games will not disappear, the decree on gambling will not change yet.
It is the task of the new leadership of the city after the elections.
Now we wouldn’t be able to do that technically, given, for example, deadlines for commenting and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative office, which must approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on a blanket ban on gambling is being held on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, the ban on gambling applies, for example, in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
Prague 1 in particular complains about this, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal of places for which she would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of And<0xC4><0x9B>la.
The decree regulating the outing of dogs the city is going for several months, not yet completed.
The location of the games and the issue of busking are solved by the city decrees.
They can only be issued or edited by the representative office of the capital.
The mayors only have an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue their own decrees.
Last week, he placed the victory of the proponents of Scottish independence within reach.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost put on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots want to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to expel the money changers from the temple than to let them dictate how they vote.
Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond knows this well, and so in a televised debate he repeatedly questioned his rival, Unionist Darling, whether he would be willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for England's independence, and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with grimace.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate about what kind of currency Scotland will have has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling has backed London’s bankers on the currency issue and has also given the impression that he will not protest against the privatization of health care.
As Salmond put it, "he went to bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous situation for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to the "boss" association, the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent-minded housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
At least Cameron has been able to say that Scotland can be a "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he communicates is clear: The cattle do not have to jump up and have to accept what is.

Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that was gone and we were just having a good time and having a good time with Grandma in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it could be obtained from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
The reading of the Fast Arrows, already in its fifties, whirling on a bicycle around the Imperial to the rear behind the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer warm, the sun was smoothing the back and shoulders, the rays of farewell rang.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday mode, sleep until half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning to get up at half past seven.
He's coming on Monday.
Most of the time it doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer is badly scorched in front of the school.
To float in the ghostly light on a banner and feel like a plastic figure in a glass jar, there is the school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
Zapotock<0xC3><0xBD> with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of it old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys taller, girls bustier.
There's the rascals, the ones to avoid, just as interesting as how infallibly they hold together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls who came in screaming, now they're laughing hysterically at something, something's probably changed in their life over the holidays, while I'm all about the old stuff.
And new pioneers, some nervous and other pleasures, why do I even lie here?
Because they have to, the education war mandatory.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who said to lend the student keys from the tin box, where they can leave the textbooks and which are still so few.
For the bottle.
The smell of the robes remains in the memory, now it is not happening, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's just the idea that the stomach is tightening and the head is starting to hurt.
A head that takes a lesson in mathematics even worse, that diabolical game for the elect, among whom I do not belong and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, the god of fives, hide from trial, fall into the bench and best sublimate, to be there and not to be there, to exist only as a name in the classroom and to dream so far stories of dearer girls and nicer buildings, not antennas in the universe.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
The born daughter let her die.
She is threatened with an exceptional punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public restroom at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without foreign help, a girl was born, which after cutting the umbilical cord wrapped in a ready blanket, hid under a jacket and took to the roadside, where she put it in bushes located several tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus I needed to go to the toilet, there I gave birth.
She was born alive, she looked at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with the scissors I was wearing to school," the defendant described, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the child's body in a backpack and carried it away, took the body out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black needle bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Brod," he says in the lawsuit, adding that he is not completely dead.
It could be in the tens of minutes, but also a few hours after birth, suffocation when covering the blanket or when inserted under a jacket, cooling or bleeding from an unbound umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
The woman, in an undisclosed period from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under the bushes near the pond in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, gave birth secretly again.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without checking if she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord, which was wrapped around her neck, she put the child in several plastic wraps, including a needle bag, and left him in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it to her.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For this reason, he is not now on trial, he was only punished for a sin against the Funeral Act.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an accomplice.
He was manipulating the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not right, but it seemed to me at the time as human," the defendant, who was allegedly subject to and feared the man, did not hide her anger.
In the course of her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears fell into her eyes when she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn’t buy the equipment because I didn’t want children, I felt young.
I wanted to put Furt in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do.
I can't explain it to you," she told the judge.
However, she refused to act with the intent and intent to kill the newborn.
According to her, the second child was born dead.
But even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
“I also cut back on smoking,” she said.
Although the pregnancy was seen on her in both cases, she claimed that she had health problems, that it was watered down.
And so does my friend.
The main characterization will continue at the castle court on Tuesday with the statements of court experts.
A ruling could be made on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened with a fine of up to 18 years in prison, or with an exceptional sentence.
Norwegian Cruise is on track to buy Prestige Cruise for $3 billion
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world’s third-largest cruise ship operator, has advanced negotiations to buy Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company that competes with major competitors Royal Caribbean Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp. (CCL.N), has allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and wealthy clients.

Hong Kong Pro-democracy Activists Inspire Chinese Authorities Day After Voting Decision
Nearby was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
A standing committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday approved only two of the three candidates for the 2017 election in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first obtain the support of the Nomination Commission, which will likely consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and force pro-democracy activists to renew their promise and cripple Hong Kong's financial center to protest the "Occupation of the Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into the city’s commercial district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Premier Li, is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei State Council were also scheduled to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would meet in front of the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start talks on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
According to a description of the events by the Russian newspaper, on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the cut-off areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin's remark was not intended to suggest that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking area would be given the power to protect its rights and freedoms.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to deal with pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy, according to which it follows from the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help the separatists to occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly-declared plot to Novorussia with the fact that it could fail.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military actions to retake the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were dominated by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as "Novorusko" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the glorious pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass published Putin’s words that anyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon is a “prisoner of illusions” because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government units are attacking civilians in separate areas.
“In the interest of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty of the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said that Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was conceived in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev’s leadership for several months and which is intended to alleviate concerns of Russian-speaking areas about threats to cultural and language rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy can be granted to the eastern regions only by the Ukrainian government.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s move to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored the Russian leadership’s approach to resolving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the overt occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two-million-strong population is ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have much more trouble annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and public opinion polls that took place even before the conflict showed broad support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats negotiated in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, essentially giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trade facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also the center of down, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inauguration speech on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
This vision of autonomy, however, differs significantly from that of the Kremlin and separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed the insurgents’ next move last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists, reinforced by the Russians, took control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities feared that it was a campaign to occupy strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civil and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with metallurgical complexes of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow gateway to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the European Union's leaders in Brussels on Saturday and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
In the territory of Ukraine there are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks.
The EU summit has not taken any definite steps - leaders are calling for the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of a more unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Lt. Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaya after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the area last week.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaya during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the photo-revealed scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his displeasure at the hackers, who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in the biggest scandal involving hacked celebrity photos.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to the leak of iCloud, personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko have reportedly been released to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked for Greece’s hand last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should be kept private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
The Greek woman, who is now in New York, told the online newspaper that the hack was “disgraceful” and that those who became its target “felt humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of him rolling up and down the pool.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where she was opposite Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and actress of the thriller Sucker Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen images.
A spokesperson for TMZ said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
The actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on Twitter: "Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma players have settled for the LeBron, even without a win
Olomouc - Thunderstorms and lightning, which co-owner of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr reported on his subordinate last week, seem to be a thing of the past.
In the end, Opava brought only a point behind the goalless draw.
After all, the deployment and fighting of the club boss have improved a bit.
The money for the salaries could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, as I talked about last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr said, adding that despite Sigma not winning, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and commitment we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we had played like that since the start of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” Lebr said.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the home team, then settled the game and in the second half was already better.
After the victory, Kalvod's confidants reached, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
But to our complete satisfaction, we missed only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were certainly more aspects.
"Whether it's from my side, from the coach or from the fans," Lebr said.
The pressure has to be taken into account by Sigma.
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to let it happen, "said the young goalkeeper Michal Reichl.
With no comment, he left a question on Lebro’s statement last week, assailant Vaclav Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not turn Sigma’s biggest opportunity into a Saturday match.
After all, he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll still be under pressure.
They all want to get away from us.
“Today we showed that if we fight and we all fuck up, we can do it,” he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not deny that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that they took Mr. LeBron's warning to heart.
Even before, it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and to frustrate it,” said the Olomouc coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to come to terms with the hardness and realize what the second league is all about.
"It's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
It remains to be hoped that in the next matches, Sigma will already work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe that," he added.
