Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they “look like maps”
Some of the Assembly Members are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that it may be the subject of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his party was concerned that it was "roming with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means "foolish/crazy", and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said the party as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said the works his party is "free-spirited" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mappet" (English: Muppet) is large.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any words by which the members of the Assembly will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of consultations with the public on proposals that indicated strong support for appointing the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly shall give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a right to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing as churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, there is neither.”
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property won’t last as long as leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that’s why the day will accelerate when these churches will close down completely because it’s not likely that most of the people who live in those apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of Methodist whites moved in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but because members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the bell of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it “cultural wealth” and “an indispensable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St. Martin’s in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the unskilled leaders of the church, and some by the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the church’s governing body, made up of non-expert leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would “demand to shift the costs” to the church board, even though the church board was not involved in hiring the architects and presbyters.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old child while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Bic<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was an excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'I'm late!
You’ve touched me!”
The whole key bone was visible to him," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and is in a critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but they decided that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the side of Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Gilles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK’s beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores filled with professional assistants.
As part of the significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market penetration, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household sectors decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be sold more than a year later.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space that was once meant for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product offering for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique series of makeup, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Creadon, south London, last week, and the second in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cooper, director of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounts on Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreements over how to split the profits from grocery stores for chemicals in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a mandatory beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons star Peter Jones has gone "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willowby does not have time for their brand Truly for products and household accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old morning program leader announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, pulling out of their lucrative branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when a television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant she no longer had time to produce them.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has been said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11m.
As the 37-year-old Willowby said on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain for one of his weekends.
A source said: “Truly has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future that would follow in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s host, one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, the mother of three children, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand’s ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't comment on his business ventures."
It was a serious conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting on what some would consider to be "non-presidential" and because he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up on so many things?
Trump said in a voice recast as a “newscaster.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization process has been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North did not see an "appropriate response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
“We are very much in agreement with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a great partnership now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they had completed missile tests, helped free hostages, and the remaining U.S. troops had returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’re going to have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed the island and claimed hundreds of lives.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, no elemental weather was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge,” Mr. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palau, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid efforts.
Due to the constant earthquakes that hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A key point in President Yoko Widodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds covered Mr Yoko's administration in the run-up to next year's re-election.
Mr Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using swords, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starr from Liverpool equals against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starridge at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball from the left side before pointing it to the far rack.
The ball was moving high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the bouncing Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“He was just trying to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible,” he told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, and I just touched her, and I didn’t think much about it, and I just shot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward pitched fifth back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half-field, and then sprinted to half-time at Liverpool.
They quickly made their way with Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the middle of the field.
He then directed a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defence and finished in the net of the far-away stand with a left-footed shot past Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves with a height of 20 feet, a spokesman for Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with Grayson Movs' stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who had seen or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras of cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she had been found at the facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police said, they will inform the close people of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Movs just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would take hours before they could return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that now the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 a.m. two police vans were at the border, and another was outside.
A number of police officers were standing at the border watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 citing entry 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorabilia in a row over "rewriting history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent presentation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning.”
Pig-killer rips and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by the name "Yuan", has been found dead with a scaly artery, blood-soaked near a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened an open door from a neighboring pig hut.
He stated that there was a large lump of blood in the carriage.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound boar broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
“My cousin’s leg was bloody and broken,” said the cousin, given the name “Wu,” according to a citation in the evening news of Guyana.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and those in charge of the market are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that have attacked humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to her husband.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig threw a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife ejected the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rain showers to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane of 5.00 Eastern Time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to infuse large tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rains in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, debris flow and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot in case of the possibility of tropical rain.
The torrential rains can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring local torrential rains to parts of the Southern California coast.
Rains of more than half an inch in total are possible, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rains spread more late on Monday and Tuesday.
The torrential rain will extend into the "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected across the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, but tropical regions remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There are nearly 20 degrees of difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start to October with high temperatures 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our longer-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blassie Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the stale political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular turnaround programs at the last minute since Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, signed an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was picking up the piano and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his impassioned testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company had average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people looking in the office.
To display better, it is an audience of similar size to a playoff match in football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, ran ahead of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an announcement that he would vote for Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught him screaming as protesters called on Friday morning as he tried to enter the elevator for a court hearing.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being molested, and it was all broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he is telling the truth?”
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on advancing Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI to consider charges against the nominee next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and several senators after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great importance, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the newspaper's main page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Chekers" Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise mutual spending "is a waste of money".
The shooting in Wade Sims: police arrested suspect Dithon Simson for the death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dithion Simpson has been arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of East Baton Rouge published the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot in the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police’s refugee unit, the state police’s forensics lab, the Southern University police, and citizens in the area for the help they gave in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her “activity in the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 6.6-foot beckon grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of Louisiana State University's basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" at Sims's death.
“This is what you care about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
The ash ejection from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after it began activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more tattoos and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's populated areas, such as Sochi.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote to secede.
A group of masked separatist supporters detained by police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, fighting broke out as well, and the police used their batons to suppress the fighting.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted “No forgetting, no forgiveness,” and on the other hand, trade union protesters shouted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, a local press statement said.
Tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was small due to the boycott by people who were against secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting in polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narcissus Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders either in self-selected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, filming the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians from both sides.
“It’s becoming more and more likely,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed before a trial last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Hitting A Car In His Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly slamming a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gate and the building itself.
At one point, he may have been shot with a shotgun at the car.
Menga's shot brought Livingston a 1–0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingstone signed the Rangers with Steven Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernian in second position.
Gerard's side remained unbeaten in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, trailing by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone remain undefeated in the division for six games, and Coach Holt has yet to face defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingstone misses chance against cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their straightforwardness caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after sliding the punch with Craig Halket's head above the goal.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the stakes.
And that’s how the final goal came about.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingstone received an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together pitched Menga, who just by touch gave a goal from the center of the sixteenth.
By that time the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but were unable to break through the hosts' defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part did not play.
That scheme continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos made a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another Livingstone-placed action.
Livingstone’s 16-year-old has been consistently passed and defended, while two requests for a penalty – after Chalket’s challenge to replace Glen Middleton and one for a hand-play – have been rejected.
“Fenomenal” by Livingstone – analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal Game and Result for Livingstone
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill course.
Their playing style and character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall on the line.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard’s leadership, they now lag behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protesters depicted the split of the visitor famous as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The clash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a major traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been put in place and buses have been diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers have been injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison's office said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which included eight prisoners and were confined to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison said: “Specially trained prison staff were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police for public order and peace were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (may be useful for dry areas)
A tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but that's likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of flash floods.
The State Meteorological Station has already issued warnings of possible flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas and So.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct path through the Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile range of the Phoenix since 1950!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mongolian rim.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are outside the risk areas for flash floods, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region has been hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, nearly 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second-highest category.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over the lower California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-strength on Sunday morning with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and is shrinking.
It is expected to be raining in Mexico with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
“It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain,” the weather.com said.
Rosa would then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which would then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening hours on Tuesday.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains are the heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States,” the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and torrents of debris, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the mobile phone footage of the incident to come out.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Cavano is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's most brutal and scandalous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the Democratic Party's greatest anger and anger" during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasy Ford's allegations that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the significance of Republicans' exit from early elections.
“Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to “resist and stand in the way.”
Kavanaugh's first key vote for the Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, with total death toll rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many taken away by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves with a height of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the sunset shore, leading many to certain death and destroying everything on their way.
After an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were not running away immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNPB, in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Enforcement Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy released by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geographical position, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could increase along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palo Alto, although authorities said the waves came around the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard screaming insanely, warning people down the street of the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water clogs the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video at once.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in cherry shelters in the courtyard of their office, they went through scenes of desolation along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began dark attempts to launch aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but there is no status yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would lighten the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been pinned under the gun for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of Indonesia's state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Handon recounted how, when news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse began circulating in the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palou, who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray ticking sign, rather than a son.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole 26,750 dollars when charging ATM at the "Newport on the dock"
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was supplementing an ATM at Newport Quay, according to a press release from Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "slid from behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses noted more suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Yej
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yee.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The society formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one annual West wore the nickname Yey for some time and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on a show she had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as a shorthand for his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yeah' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s me, it’s you, it’s me, it’s us.
He departed from Cana, which means the only one, up to Yej alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pi Diddy or Diddy, but this year he released his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a dash and all capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it won't use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico’s president, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were entrenched in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research funding in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements on artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Depending on the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpowers in Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the world's largest private equity firms.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked American player in the hospice, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China border.
Lee thanked the U.S. government for previous competitions on technology as a challenge in robotics for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often need to work hard in order to receive state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the creation of the National Commission on the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change her name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked her demands for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right in its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia’s Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot read: “Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievskia in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjo<0xC5><0xA1>e Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents set by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required output.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has spent his entire defense of Brighton on goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly beat Brighton's defence in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield submission at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between the three defending players of Brighton, before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
He bypassed one defensive player before rushing several others to the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then passed to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first touchdown to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, with a single stroke on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
“We were lucky to score at that point.”
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave them Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before she led Sterling to the remote tripod.
The attack of the "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Chercer wants to play a spoiler against Rocky
Since the Nashvilles were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But competitive Chercer is always hoping to make it to the center square on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies team, who are leading with one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockys team had at least a “joker” for a 5–2 win over the Nashvilles on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw in knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be played at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nashnells is yet to announce a starter for a week, but reportedly is inclined to allow Chercer to throw in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start after the 34th time, trained throwing on Thursday and will throw usually rested on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18–7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in the 220 2/3 innings season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Cavano to the Supreme Court while speaking about the importance of Republicans’ exit from early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the abomination.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, when they have to run to get power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, ugly and untrue.”
He mentioned Senator Diana Feynstein of the Democratic Party, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the public responded with cries of outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, and no, I wait a little—it was a very bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Laborers no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinions are not tolerated.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last member of parliament from the Labour Party to be told we are not welcome – just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment because she takes a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the East Nottingham Labour Party stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party parliament, the council meetings on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that’s not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “softer, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed ever started.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged to be acceptable to party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to completely change my thinking and take positions that I would otherwise never have taken, whether it was national security or the internal front.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there’s a critical abuse of social media that calls for condemnation, renunciation of the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labor Party.
I’m not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassments every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions, and with every request for "no confidence" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower opinions.
I’ve been getting a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud and then “everything’s going to be okay.”
But that’s not why I’m in politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of Thatcher’s government that literally let my classroom collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them most, whether as a local councilor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have been confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.

Air 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match on the day of the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which the home team took, and coach Peter Murchi is entitled to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our matches so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ear, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the nevercone.
Klimo owed Ear's lead with a penalty, previously, right at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to score 17–5 for Ear on the save.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was carried away, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDowell's point, converted by Klimo.
Air's CEO, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with Bruce Colvin's unconverted point at the end of the time with relentless pressure.
But the home team bounced back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock down Klimo without the ball, McPherson drew a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's punch and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The ‘Still Game’ star looks set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiran appears poised to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed he had been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, in which he is a screenwriter and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be their last, and it looks like Kirnan is planning for a life after Craiglange.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a covertly falsified naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
It has to come back to us.”
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be at their highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on Oct. 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it is expecting a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit which, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is bound to negotiate to overturn the decision.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he solemnly declared at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even if it rules in their favor.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to assign territory to Chile and said it would not decide the outcome of the talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicated that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And for the past four years, they may have reversed the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales’s warlike rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an amazing opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit," he said.
Callasdia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it won't get nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore's North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's "fiction" to believe that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declarative end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of drops or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
Finally, the impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent out their creations that fall into the eyes of the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized supplements included watermelons with zircons, magic hats, and even pineapples, but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lector more than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment complete with glasses and a dive tube, and the other looked like a frozen ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats may come in stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the overly impractical hat that spread across social media sent another big creation down the runway, a crushed beach bag nearly equal in size to the height of the model it was dragging.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in Jacemus's La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Luc Armitage, a fashion designer, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which only reinforces with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginary.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of “5+”.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher score of “5+” in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also achieved “5”.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the Employment and Skills Commission of the OK noted that of the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more compulsory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be numerous languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"It has to be done" (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it will play is not yet decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
YouTube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, because Republicans may lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Shore Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia via the internet with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address a hearing of the man he nominates for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh, which has become tense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected postponement of the Senate vote to a week, while the FIA probe lasts.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
Hence, President Trump’s campaign said that these five rallies next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, the rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday marks Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not good for Maurice that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls,” said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Rider 2018: The U.S. team showed courage in the fight to keep alive the hopes of the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, Saturday afternoon's fours may have been exactly what he needed at the Ryder Cup.
The twist of luck is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would have thought that happiness was now?
“They had a lead of six points, and now they’re four, so we’re a little lucky I guess,” Jordan Spitt said after today’s game.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, of leading by four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in their sails although they have enough momentum, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and leads by example.
Those strong cheers of celebration grew stronger throughout his game, with a key strike leading to a four-four draw when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His shot at winning the game at 15 was met with a similar cry, one that tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
“You just have to dig deeper and take care of your match,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for every player right now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
"Mollywood" were the only couple without a bad hit on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided a bad hit on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensured that they were the players to win on Sunday and that there would be no other popular players to secure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both are preferred at the same time in different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unwarranted.
Buba Watson and Webb Simson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of doubles, when he teamed up with Alex Norren.
A failed strike and two of the first nine doubles buried the Spaniard and the Swedish in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
Couples and fours are so fascinating to watch from close up because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t listen to, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant lead on the final day, but the four-season also showed that the U.S. team could fight although some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will come in with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours from 10-6 ahead of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn's European team, which struggled to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated ahead of the American team which had a lot of misses in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but were unable to reach the lead.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points out of 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, were the second pair to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played great and beat worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deschamps with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting while the morning doubles lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans did not have all that pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2-1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and later returned to beat Pulter and Rory McLroy 4&3 in fours, but lost in the opening, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a particular team recovered from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as holders of the title, Furik's team was satisfied with an even result to retain the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the weekly counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says 'no chance' to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance the country will unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and committing itself to countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to nuclear disarmament access “in phases,” according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not disprove unilaterally, non-nuclear disarmament.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump secured a security guard on the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to give in to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first and foremost’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a futile dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the other side of this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been completed.”
Despite this, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “self-destructive”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, much praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until nuclear disarmament is achieved.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in full and without exception until full, final nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the O.N. General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea after only a few hours due to "gangster demands".
North Korea has committed to a meeting with Moon this month over the disarmament of a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho-culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything about basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said no one, ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a student home where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart and stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette.”
The culture of pride in “work all night” still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizeller design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which shifts the light away from the bedroom.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerard's team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The IBROX team wanted to record their first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the run-off leading team.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' line-up lost inspiration and chances of a draw.
Now the Rangers have fallen to sixth place, and Livingston have climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian according to the goal difference.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit with a distant object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livingstones who won a point with the Harts last week and would have been happy with the way his well-trained squad smothered opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated possession over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than with them.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when Menga's first loss swept Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then Kihan Jacobs' long-range hit reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lowes collided, but Judge Steven Thomson did not give a sign of approval to the Colombian's complaint.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get wet from Lassana Kulibali's head blow and Ovi Edaria's weak hit.
Although the start of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs's blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with the blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoyed, with Litgou and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head with Litgo.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, had another penalty claim after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DEFEND ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then it has become the mainstay of science, the Geiger counter has become the mainstay of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, which features the seemingly inconceivable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emit radioactivity into the minerals.”
Evans: “Say, it’s probably jumping now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their exchange in the laboratory.
You can "see" protein common in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab, so they can "see" a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump exit, wearing a cap with his motto, after performing Saturday night live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night, following an impromptu performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised him and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called City of Ghosts, in which he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Famous Again, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, related to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's downfall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had struggled to get behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't show up with that hat."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in the sunken place, he said, according to Washington Egzeminer.
The news continued: “Do you want to see the sunken place?” he said that he would “put on his superman-cap, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try it with love.”
His comments drew outrage from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show looked embarrassed, Varajeti reported, one man told the publisher: “The whole studio is taking over.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
News surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as a bottle of Perier.
News received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: I THANK YOU FOR RESISTING A LOT."
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was his own and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Me too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Kane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg is named Snoop Lyon, and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant robbery
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakmore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of a macho-hero when he said that such on-screen roles meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to be respected.
In a statement on the Sunday Times' Culture section, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #SagaChapter era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" about the matter.
“Personally, I have strong feelings at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is it taught?
What do you learn from TV, and what on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ended the following summer, saying that it "ends with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that what he met his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me the future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love-hate relationship with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new events were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data provided by a staff member related to a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on the pages of Wikipedia lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were made by "ultra-right" sympathizers and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill while a Senate panel was in session to hear allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavano, who was nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The information came shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstone have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the post is linked to Waters' office and information about a Waters staff member has been released, Hill said.
"These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie," Waters said.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those false and false allegations – is in no way responsible for the information disclosed.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“These denials are nerve-wracking,” wrote Fleischer.
“This shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He needs to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher appears to have compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavano, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant institutions and the police of the false allegations.
“We will allow criminals to be found,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.”
Opinion of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermines the spy scams of Rowan Atkinson
Now it’s traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new British relationship movie, and that seems to apply to this re-enactment of the franchise of the sham, action comedy Johnny English – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English again.
Will careful self-loathing on the subject of how obvious we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity the nation has?
Despite all this, Johnny English's big-eyed face and many grimaces have been given a license to "lock things up" for the second time - his name above all indicates that he is a wide-ranging comical creation, made for moviegoers in places where English is not spoken.
He is, of course, a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour, is somewhat similar to Clouseau, has Mr. Bean's lines, and part of the boy who plays a note from the song Cars on Fire from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Its basis is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in Barclays' now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor fins hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures aren’t as inventive and focused as the silent quirks of Atkinson’s character.
The thing that is going on all the time is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent in charge – a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a more pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives her all in this character of quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the script that would work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired ones.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a private school, but "in black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a school for spying that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for messing up everything in the Royal Secret Service, are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirillenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd procedures: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a mess after they smuggle themselves on Volta's luxury yacht; and English initiates a real anarchy when he tries to use his helmet on a sledgehammer.
All the brakes have been removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice, moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that will use his talent?
Labour denies they have a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week – but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to take advantage of the savings they’re making with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would get the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea "matches" with the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be more workers-friendly.
The transition to a four-day work week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member told the Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a pursuit that is consistent with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party was campaigning for a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration was not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “faceless CEOs” and “profits” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make “deductions” because of unethical behavior.
He also confirmed workers' plans to become part of the company's boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds so that 10 percent of private company capital will belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy make 60 Minutes statement on whether FBI investigation of Cavano could change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings could persuade some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I think so,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unquestioning.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Cavano and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied vigorously," Graham added, referring to Kristin Blasey Ford.
“Not everyone I know can confirm it.
That's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big grass in the central park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise the stakes.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful work that will help to get them up to speed.
But how successful is a Goalkeeper Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert the right way to get people to ask for something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, who acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped inspire world leaders to pledge commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements as a result of their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are The Power of Food, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in Britain, dedicated to “helping children realize their potential,” which has promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help with under-nutrition in the country since it received a $700 grant.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens the same as you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a record in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Food, in front of assembled people at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were undertaken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, The Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road – we’ll never make it.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for 'blockade' to disrupt Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington could "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinky said.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria - namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, with a blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing the fuel," he said, while talking about Russia as an "uncomfortable pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the “inappropriate” Nord-Tek 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemp, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “carefully consider” whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the forefront,” she said, according to Hill.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump’s work during a city hall meeting and said he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as Supreme Court Justice, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent support such a proposal.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the potential nomination, and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known Democratic party names being discussed for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trek Palin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paylin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq since signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“Through what my son is going through, through what he is going through after coming back, I know how other families who are torn apart by the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning from are feeling,” she told an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called the arrest an "elephant in the room" and said her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little different, they're coming back solidified, they're coming back and wondering if there's respect for what they and their aviation buddies, and every other member of the ground."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila Police.
18 U.S. states and the city of Washington support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support challenging the new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker contesting the policy, the NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Parliament case, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" had molested her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
The defense attorney representing Grace has described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a number of asylum claims originate in the United States, as nations with ongoing gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. public defender Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the federal, federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the claim and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the U.S. are harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary labor.”
Public defender Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said at the June 11 policy presentation.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu as the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she consoled her male baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their listed items to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, were resting in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the rubble on the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "harassing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about China Daily's paid supplement in the De Moin Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election signaled the U.S. services’ concurrence with Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they are leveling import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states such as Iowa, which back Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time Iowa governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the De Moin Register, “now doubles the abuse of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In the debunking of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free media by placing ads in the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans distance themselves from women's votes ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are not watching or defending Brett Cavanaugh’s nomination in the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated that they want to proceed with the vote.
There is no turning back from such things,” wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for Hill, in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that the pressure for an FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a protest in the Senate aisle, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People already say they’re tall; that’s right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent women voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s nominee, analysts suggest that there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Cavano will go to the hearing, it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, although a greater number accept the first-remembered side.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying at the time of the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, of Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, last week that Cavano had drunkly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge candidate of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Companies, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up business.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "Internet data warehouse" or short POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal strengthening through data.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, process, and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of coders-volunteers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce full-blown change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
Berners-Lee said in a statement on Saturday that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's World Network Consortium.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate about internet neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: A well-known Victorian cross-bearer of the First World War
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel-in-Chief Bernard Vand received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglize and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he received the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was an "incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Wang led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "a very thick fog and under heavy fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places from which he fired and with "the greatest courage" led forward, before he himself attacked the cannon nest and disabled three of the servants.
Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I’ll never be able to accomplish, but it’s something that makes us humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Wang said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of the combined fighting skills stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, you are awake all night to watch Belator 206, and you do not have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain remained suffocated when the channel switched to Pepa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the switch to children's cartoons as a "sick joke".
“The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Belator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Pepper Pig," yes.
The company’s president, Billator Scott Cooker, said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
“I think when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer and none of them were benign.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
“We’re going to limit the number to five fights, instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Albums on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone is not like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's first desert island radio show, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show Kirsty Young, took a multi-month vacation due to illness.
Appearing as a sidekick in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “Until this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist became a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke in public because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 — “surprised me.”
Daly married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked them was if they had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming of all my life – to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which he had thrown in his head in preparation for the Olympics and which he was still mocking.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 UK daylight saving time.
Mikkelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michelson, who played at the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as he often represents the United States, the five-time winner, he divides the time to cheer and practice his game, the range, in the hope that he will fix what silences him.
Never been the best leader, not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where far-fetched hits are a regular punishment for inattentiveness.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who plays in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson's game can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
“He fully understands the role he played today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s been a big part of the team and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's what happened, and we thought that's what we had to do.
He likes to play, like everyone else.”
Mikelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most games played at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 lost games and seven halves, although Furik said his presence carries something immaterial in the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s sensitive, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players were having fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead ahead of individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward position.
The Dane made his debut in a game at Valderama in 1997, when the Steve Ballesteros-led type had a five-point lead over the Americans, but "they crossed the finish line just with their noses", with the lowest lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, when we lost and in Valderama, when we won a little bit,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said, pictorially, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10–6 lead on the Golf.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play as you should.
This isn’t over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
“All the time I say, I focus on 12 players on our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side – the best players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added that he was satisfied with the results of his players on a difficult golf course: “I don’t want to give an early assessment on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow, we’re going to play a different game, and that’s a different story.
It’s great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then all abilities are tested as a golfer.
That's the message that should be sent to the players, to give their all tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will require players to play better individually than they have played in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both ends of the changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
“I remember every word there,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of opposing first and facing Rory McLroy the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything," Bjorn said of the selection in the individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed.
The latest German Navy frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war-era warships, but that won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is the less frequent maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships – which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans – will be out of date by the time they enter service.
The frigate with the unfortunate fate of the F125 reached the front pages last year, when the German navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that caused the warship to be useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also found that the ship was dramatically over-planned weight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings about Germany’s reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the navy was "depriving ships that could be deployed".
The representative said that the problem has worsened over time, because old ships have been withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the navy.
The national trust listens to the secret life of the bats
A new property survey is being conducted in Scottish mountain areas to find out how bats use the area in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers to the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the common and soprano bats, as well as the brown long-eared bats and the deafenton bats at Inverough Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
En-Ash-Es staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analyses of the sounds from all the recordings will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
Then a map of the habitats will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, Nature Conservation Advisor at N.T.E., hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction works and development that affect the beds and the loss of housing.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do fly-sticks and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
Ann-Ty-Es, who takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes the bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Triv property in Dumfries and Galway, which is home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triv we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good housing.
But there are a lot of unknowns about the bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses that it is important to check whether there are bats before renovations of the properties are carried out because the unconscious destruction of the beds can destroy up to 400 women and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Pets are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish civil servant at the Trust for the Protection of the Lilies, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Will Sue German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news,” adding that people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been charged with raping an American woman, named Catherine Majorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly then paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking live on Instagram to his 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were brought, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an intolerable transmission of suspicions about private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
Allegedly, the incident that is the subject of the accusations occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the court in the Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good boy" but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a no-court settlement because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret' what car manufacturers have lost
Britain will "always regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japan’s automaker said the impact of border freezes in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnastone plant - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a production shutdown at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director in Burnastone.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, will work when leaving the EU without a deal.
Be-Em-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on time, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a break in the border that industry says could cause delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily stock of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "exactly designed to avoid such border checks".
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will not only give us the success we’re going to enjoy right now, but we need to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s programme today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is a representative of the union at the factory, said his members are becoming increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are taken down, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Brett Cavano’s appointment to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s potential violation of laws.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and threaten Miller’s independence has been fueling controversy in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine B. Foreley, testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
To the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been determined, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings were not due to a distaste for the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I'll agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organizes more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it more often, and you are witnessing that we have been doing it repeatedly over the past few weeks, and conversations with the president of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Secretary of Health in a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system regarding fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system expressing the country’s gratitude and the desire to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the costs of solved status applications for EU citizens working in the public services at a lower level.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued throughout the summer, with a view to taking the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of not reaching a deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of benefit to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' defensive back, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline of the playground and just slumped to the ground,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground and then put him in a stretcher and took him to further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecromby is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red suit in Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five downs on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 downs made this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year, funds that will be used to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-earning individuals.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK, with the additional funds stepping up the government’s efforts to improve the situation with the homeless.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of a property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London were purchased by non-UK residents, which led to an increase in prices and caused difficulties for those buying property for the first time to get involved in this process of buying a home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices for land-holding properties, but did not use it, and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and ending emigration for no good reason.
He also wants the councils to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my ministry to returning to the British dream, that is, to make life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning one’s own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of the homeless too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "extreme ambition" was to become manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of bringing the club to life in the Northeast, which is currently in third place in the Premier League with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Scottish Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in ‘Hampden’ with my dad and there was always something pulling me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardiche, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel any discomfort knowing he needed to follow such established names in such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success is currently being assessed with ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It is not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think that I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, which he entered into after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from a third-league slump and brought St. Mirren back from the brink of losing the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crossroads for me,” he recalls at the Alloa takeover.
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, earning enough from it and enjoying certain high benefits.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of a manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for a beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Figures show pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s business consulting firm said: “Solar time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent.
The drop in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June further worsened during July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold have seen a much higher increase compared to previous years, as opposed to restaurants where there has been a decline.
Pubs where mostly food is sold were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by just three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s vacation and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales over a one-year period will be particularly striking in addition to the ongoing pressures of costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of premises where mostly food is sold and the weather will show whether the more temperate temperatures we had in August will provide much-needed breath."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the release of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracking device in the UK’s pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data on the effectiveness of the same of 47 operating groups with combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and represents a strong benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media profile they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Instagram” profiles.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” profile that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates a social media profile that they hide from adults.
The study, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” profiles, an acronym for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has increased the fear that such profiles will publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main” profile that they show to their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile has come across a teenager asking others to "rape her."
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is secret.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ on Scottish Athletics Board
Elid Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport's leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and global athletics community has tremendous respect for Elid and we are confident that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my own contribution and help steer the sport in the right direction in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200-meter and 400-meter titles at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, in addition to winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a commentator on the BBC, could not walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was painstaking, but I managed to fully recover, again I can go and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a division of opinions on the Internet
A breast pump company has caused a division of opinions on the internet when it published an ad in which breastfeeding mothers were compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be “the world’s most innovative breast pump,” user-oriented technology company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of cows with hay on a song whose lyrics sound like this: “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed these aren’t tits, these are my breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pump, pump, feed babies, pump, pump, mow my breasts.”
However, the ad that was posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlighted the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stolen from them only a few days after they give birth," one of the comments reads.
Elvie's breast pump discreetly fits into the nursing bra ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, on the other hand, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "ridiculous."
“I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like that if I was still eating.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a great product,” one of the commenters said.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad designed for mothers who are milk-molding (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were plugged into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk-milling pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes, and discreetly fits into the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while milking.
Ana Balarin, a partner and RDR at Mother commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women milking and dairy cows, we wanted milking with the help of a pump and the challenges it brings to put them in the center of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings to a whole.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been featured in every title.
During a fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Marta Yakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of child migrants in custody has increased significantly, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be accommodated by sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would need to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of the sponsors illegally reside in the country and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to hunt those individuals," said Mr. Albens.
In order to speed up cases with children, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say they voted on the previous standard.
Many of them will appear via a conference video call, rather than in person, in order to present their case for legal status to the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to receive relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become upset and depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, say workers at shelters and reports that emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Thornillo, where due to its size, there is a greater likelihood of neglecting signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could heighten the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian territory under the pretext that they were participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be dealt with appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualeem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompt refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politicizing the issue of what should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition soon in order to draft a constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualeem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump will win the 2020 election again unless his presidential term is prematurely interrupted by impeachment and scandal, which most liberals are likely hoping for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The Most Dramatic Presidency Finale Ever Seen!"
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
Since 2014, the hittime rating has more than doubled to reach 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of the crash, which is 1.7 million more than four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is reported.
“This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, ABC’s main television producer of the drama “Designated Survivor” for the secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran of comedy writing and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He said, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Ms. Scovel told me.
There is also a certain fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you’re no longer an uninformed citizen when for six hours you’ve seen a panel of experts discussing the use of the “deep-back” page by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s “Fear,” and the 15,000-foot-tall “Diablo” of the US.
I, for example, will never be able to watch Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a reality show is that every night brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for the rotating team at Trump’s show and the day-to-day flips.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode because then you won’t be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flays this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He couldn’t stop looking, at least not when Brett Cavano was supposed to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in a critical state.
“I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flays told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Inflow of foreign funds in the tightest midterm elections in the race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is being run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took a seat in another area in last spring's emergency election.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough competition to fund campaigns between the main sponsors of the parties, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("NRCC").
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the emergency election for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district held in March that was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then gave up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the State Department.
But only in relation to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received U.S. assistance of about $140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
All three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without reporting heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller’s report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our election.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly before a jury made up of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, not even to his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly to film the president and speculated that he was unfit for the role he performs.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What should we do if Brett Cavanaugh’s new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unjust, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy will have a long winter ahead.
But I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for Saturday at a swastika-log table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans of Rangers optimistic ahead of 'Rapid Vienna' clash
The Rangers are hosting the clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware of the fact that after the undecided match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for the Europa League.
Graham Dorence, the middle-ranked player due to a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unresolved 2–2 match with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a stepping stone to greater achievement.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we came back with a winning point.
Maybe we could give a little more in the end, but the unsolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope that we will win three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last match, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year in terms of everything that happened, i.e. my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can go forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the study participants, conducted by Nationwide, said they talked to their marital mates about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide for you if you don’t share your wishes with them ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family and talk about where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover your expenses or provide you with self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Arrange your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Remove a health care power of attorney so that you can empower a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Also, think about the power of your finances.
In this way, you would choose a person of trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Please note these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan like that.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he returned home from an exit.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British daylight saving time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of casualties is expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers cannot receive information from Dongala District, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Following are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit western Dongla in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake struck Paddy Jaya district in Aceh, prompting devastation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence, and opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police officers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in the Matt-Su detention facility with the possibility of going out if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU said.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he would testify in court, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is pending.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, involvement in a crime report for domestic violence, and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, at a magnitude of 7.5, caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York City Terrorist Attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on a bicycle path on the West Side Motorway in lower Manhattan and to overtake pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a report on the death penalty claim filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, there is an opportunity to pronounce the death penalty on both these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The execution of the attack required "detailed planning and thought," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed him as "horrible, cruel and perverse."
"Sajfulo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laure Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Alonso," Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n D<0xC3><0xA1>il <0xC3><0x81>leh <0xC3><0x81>leh <0xC3><0x81>leh<0xC3><0xB3>n
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
They were both sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty on all 22 counts of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be in Charge of Brexit Talks <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage today, during a Tory party conference protest, promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's lawmakers proposing he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out of the EU" if Mr Farage had been secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by the counter-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a separate protest against Brexit that was taking place in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue with the implementation of the plan by the Checkers despite attacks by pro-Brexit, counter-Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and Labour party members to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Mr Bon told the pro-Brexit meeting “Leave Means Leave” in Solihull that he wants to “reject the plan from the Chequers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The Wellington MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the plan from the Chekers.”
Expressing his anti-EU stance, he said: “We did not fight in world wars until now to be subjugated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, was also present at the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists who are actually those who take to the streets and to whom our victory in the elections is due.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening to us.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to pass the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the cheering crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win in Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit faces marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners with the inscription "Tory against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application the party had created.
“These are people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to think hard about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "think well about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a representative of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future during a town hall rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the November re-election against Republican Party State Representative Jeff Dill, who was the co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiock was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, in which he used the format of a city hall.
One of the attendees asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
Suspect arrested in connection with the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Simms of the LSU team that occurred on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dithion Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing weapons, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 caught balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team with his orders secured victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Waltery Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the loose while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the turmoil at the end of the group, something that was supposed to have a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action that forced Ferrari's driver reluctantly to leave the interior at his own free risk to remain on the sidelines after the double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the net and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then led the majority of the race and steered the tyres of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round boxing, but was unable to increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came in fourth.
Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finstein at Saturday's rally over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blassy Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that what was happening in the Senate had shown that people were "malicious and rude and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and mean and reckless and dishonest," he said.
“When you see posts and leaks of information and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document – “oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn't publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Finstein with information about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh as early as July, and they were released in early September, but Finstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Finstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what she asked.”
But it seems that the president does not believe her denial, so he commented on the same at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their malice, their meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to regain their power and control," the president said.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss of the Elite League game on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
"Giants" were given the advantage of two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney scored an advantage for the host before Dwyer returned to lead the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee ahead of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season within the Elite League for Adam Kiefi's boys, who returned with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's chance came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, which was provided by David Rutherford while Bowier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was the quick opening of the match, Sullivan securing the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauny to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure the lead of Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory in half of the final period of the fifth game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home at Milton Keynes.
A flight controller was killed helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake.
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he was killed helping a plane with hundreds of people fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong successive tremors continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufrey Airport in Palu, which was constantly rocking.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo Alto.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands of people, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongla, Sighi and Butong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even be accessed,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The dams, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Quick help carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I choose all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said the CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, after previously saying that the 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane struck the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to get through the water that reached them halfway and head to the emergency exits of the plane that sank.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue the ship, with the help of an inflatable boat, carrying people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included the airline Air Niugini.
An analyst determined the time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended up presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He told the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When it was revealed on the basis of the data that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he stated that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude about this genre by including positive messages in their music.
Bristol's "The High Breed" claims that hip-hop is moving away from its origins as political message music aimed at solving social problems.
They want to get back to its roots and re-popularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a “racist” message
A New York nanny is suing a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after she mistakenly received a message from her mother complaining that she was "another nigger."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is in fact “bullying.”
Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when, in 2016, after the first working day of the new carer, Giselle Morris found out that she was black.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE IS ALL ONE BLACK," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaxman had actually done, feeling "inconvenient" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job badly and that instead of her, she was expecting the nanny to be fired.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350 a day layoff damage over a six-month period, a commitment that would include her living with the family, which she was originally engaged to, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that they shouldn’t do things like this,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations that they were racist, saying the dismissal of Ms. Morris was a reasonable move because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby only two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Will you attack someone who is in a situation like this?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemns the married couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect with a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before being inspired to write the little bear-shaped toy book, would still be optimistic if his work wasn’t well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “both bitter and bitter.”
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt a quiet pride in his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and didn’t want to brag at all,” she said.
But because he felt Paddington was so real, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you.
I think Paddington’s success was perceived that way.
Although it was a creation and a fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital "Louis Pasteur 2" in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“Nad called to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by doctors to keep pumping her heart was slowly diminishing, and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay home.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I bowed my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Deplorable women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make an effort to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney says her son had great potential to become a cook as well as an infectious smile.
“Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up any room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because it was "in a really dark place."
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it's going to have a follow-up effect."
Ms. Davis makes the cards “to let others know that there are people out there who they can talk to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner, Mark, to whom she was married 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye at all and did not establish any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: “Such a thing ruins the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Cavanaugh has been uncertain since the FBI began its investigation.
“I thought that if we could actually get something that looked like what he was looking for, a limited-time, limited-range investigation, maybe we could achieve a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is “falling apart” in conditions of entrenched partisanship.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitancy is solely due to the timing.
The midterm elections should be held in just a few weeks, that is, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush addresses the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who in turn worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to alter the undecided result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has 'decreased' under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean deputy said.
Park Beyong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the stalemate of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work toward the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S.-imposed sanctions for stagnating in progress from then to now.
“If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that if his temperament is taken into account he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman did this, she would say she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasy Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes even yelling and barking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemns Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him “gross and coordinated destruction of his reputation” organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony is proof that he can’t serve in the Supreme Court because he has proven to be biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way the Clinton family and the Democrats attacked him," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him are confirmed and if the Democrats win a majority in the House.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then not only is he not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit to serve in the court where he’s currently in office,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about the possible verdicts that Kavanaugh will make against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn any of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to step into court and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s a really sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, is it?”
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who performed an executive function somewhere, who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but managed to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she’s talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad for it.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated was once I started crying with unspeakable anger and an older woman, a cold manager I’d always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve been able to reach you.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called “Monkey Business” and pulled out of the presidential race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply infuriated, realized that there was no reason for her not to think about the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later through laughter.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched long ago, she did not have enough financial resources, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not raise 2 million US dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, and not delegates and anger at sexism.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'd think the Clinics were my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening and despite the battle being far from over, the clash between the countries could be useful for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Each time Beijing returned to nature, it recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent of U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return the U.S. to the same measure, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give up on the same in the near future.
To force Washington to withdraw means to accept its demands, but public worship of the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing performs well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as the interdependence of the two economies is reduced.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the onset of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than was previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the AZ.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild a country left devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by the terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily lives are now provided.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed the aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the U.S. team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primacy after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, on his first hole kick, threw the ball into the water in par-3 at the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has stood out in all circles, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since he started organizing the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 to the lowest ranked player of the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points won during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
This year was really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy that we brought the title back.
Team play is the most important and I’m happy that I could help,” Garcia said after Europe’s win.
He now takes the place of his compatriot John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, on Sunday one-on-one, with a score of 2:1.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost in all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to steer the game toward low-grass fields, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick said after his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning, we had a tough time with the European team.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They've outdone us.
