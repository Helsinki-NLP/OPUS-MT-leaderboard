A fire in a French chemical plant has been extinguished.
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed especially on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory is owned by the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett, and is subject to the soviet law of the European Union.
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak leaked the gas methanethiol and the environment smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog 57 days ago
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and for this she gave up her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left the dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked the dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalls to Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days went by weeks. “I never gave up. I never lost hope,” Carole King told the “Daily Inter Lake” who quit her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, we got a call from Carole King: A man had called and told her that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I just hugged her, and I didn't want to let her go," he said.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. The rest is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearful" scale.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a list classified as a case of closure by the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, so far two guns, one gun part and 3474 gun ammunition have reappeared. The type of gun still missing are two machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G-Pistol, four guns of the type G-Pistol.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "terrifying", said the Left-Bundestag MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since little was found in the course of investigations. The Left-Politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized the fact that he did not agree with the statement.
Stena Impero oil tanker leaves Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that it wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz with violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Britain's Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran, and several of them were drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel Appreciates People's Courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago at the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have wavered the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for an extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, but despite the delivery boom, there have been recent losses to the electric car group.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog “Electrek.”
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children resist tickling so fiercely, only then to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the cerebellum, which already triggers laughter while waiting for the tickling.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats react with "laugh" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the cerebellum, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is why people could not tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the affected area of the cerebrum during a self-touching would be suppressed by the brain itself.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time are also suppressed, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain just can’t distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people can’t tickle themselves because the self-touch is a big brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, they interrupted this initiation in the experiment sometimes prematurely, showed escape behavior or fearlessness. This ambivalence was the same as the children's behavior. The ambivalence of tickling was a behavioral reaction that was the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: large-scale fire in French chemical plant wiped out
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the prefecture of Normandy told the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances were reported to have escaped. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in use with about 200 fire extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens are closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements. About 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, in 2013, when a leak leaked the gas methanethiol and the environment smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU if Brussels does not comply with his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
On Cox, who had campaigned for Britain's stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to carry out the EU withdrawal". Cox had been assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Monument to Oslo and Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya Attacks Revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya with 77 dead, a monument in honor of the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Iron Rose" (German: the Iron Rose) consists of about 1,000 iron imitations of roses. They remind of the roses that had been laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the cathedral.
In the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first set fire to a car bomb in the government district of Oslo on 22 July 2011 and then shot dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya, killing a total of 77 people in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" captured in Iran was able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been trapped in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters, and after being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the shipping company Stena Bulk.
"Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things," said Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon, the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish TV channel SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the ministry said in a statement.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had fixed the tanker on July 19 on the charge of violating the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Now they were quickly released from their families. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said H<0xC3><0xA5>nell.
The British government suspected behind the determination of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: there was at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was chained. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated the EU sanctions against the country of war the United States received from Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Allegedly, it was an exchange deal to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran, with several cases of drug trafficking.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons against the Iranian leadership. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time prevents its political and economic isolation.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection forces, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be the "winner of war". In view of the punitive tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on a Chinese manufacturer, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reposition themselves. The chief financial officers of Asian companies, who are considering transferring their production from China to another country, will not be able to do so.
But now India itself has come into Trump’s focus. Deprecating from the Haudegen in the White House as the “kingdom of tariffs”, America has withdrawn from the emerging country the trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The US accuse India of prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are of course only a sideshow. In addition, the United States has the fifth largest democracy in the world, also seen through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salute of American punitive tariffs and Indian anti-India tariffs.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development, has a more difficult position in the socialist republic of India. Also under modi. Its reformer aims mainly at the bureaucratic insanity, which in the pre-people state has been building up for too long, and is building up for everyone.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five years of the Modi regime. But this is not true in trade policy. It is encouraging to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the new government even set up.
In the West, mods are attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is economically radically renewing his country's nationalistic mods. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, the "India First" party's abbots are abbots, but never protects to the "India First" lawyer.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the family of Chirac. The funeral will take place in a family home in Paris.
Targeted by competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world’s top had long since been in the goal, when the down-cooled Khalifa International Stadium had warmed up to its warm-up stage. The men’s first over 5000 meters goal, Jonathan Busby from Aruba, began to fluctuate dangerously, barely 300 meters before the goal, and ran out in an unhealthyly bent position, as if in a brackish position.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would not have done the same," said Dabo, "to be proud of the race in the Mixed Zone, to be proud of it, to be proud of it, to be proud of it, when it would have been difficult to get the attention of the assembled journalists. To be shy, he just didn't want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to be able to be proud of it, and to be able to be proud of it.
He did this the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this feat of heroism will be remembered in the end. When Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who had just won this run, the end was not used to anything.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. Although, according to official data, he managed with 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up ahead of possible government-critical protests. A heightened police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, police have stepped up their roadside checks and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, however, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, which were "protesting" for hundreds of participants. They called for a ceasefire against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years, and the regime in Spain has been building up in exile.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) also did not count more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) did not count more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily arrested" "only because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place'", HRW also informed, citing lawyers arrested. The charges against the arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "uni-terrorist association", to accusations of violence against others.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country, according to which the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online Merchants: Shipping Merchants Should Be Easier to Donate Returns
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While the companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations, the ministry explained on a question of the Green Federalist faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke-Media Group reported on Friday, but the traders could set the market value of unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens send back every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - subsequently ended up in the trash. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities assess material donations as a revenue, which is then taxed.
Green group leader Katrin G<0xC3><0xB6>ring-Eckardt urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by decree that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donation to the model, but also on building it online.
Banksy Art at Auction: There's never been a better time to sell this painting
Streetart-Star Banksy's well-known work, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work highlights "the re-establishment of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy in the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital, until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the South West of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-examined the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently delivered a hard blow to the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday following the suspension of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit, which has already been postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary even without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has meddled in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted an image depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament, in the opinion of his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it.
Johnson had attacked opponents of Brexit in parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betrayal" to the people, accusing them of putting MPs in danger because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as a "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to restore calm would be for MPs to finally respect Britain's decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain still had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect to each other," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, on his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, has once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
If not, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If this goes badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had withdrawn from the Indian Kashmir region the status of autonomy and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots at the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 detainees join in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless. But since the takeover of power by General Abdel-Sahrtah in 2013, everything has been done in the past.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get a grip on, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is ten percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who it finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only the most important to the economy, but also to the food industry.
T<0xC3><0xBC>v tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No more "showstoppers" for Capital Airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complex system mesh in the BER fire protection system works together. The operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the T<0xC3><0xBC>v is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale T<0xC3><0xBC>v tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport manager Engelbert L<0xC3><0xBC>tke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal to work out. "We have a lot of detail topics, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this fall.
"In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations here, intensive work must continue to be done to address the deficiencies," T<0xC3><0xBC>v said in a written statement.
L<0xC3><0xBC>tke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not yet work satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke skirts that go down in the event of a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They should go down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced with gas.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Costs have increased from two billion since the beginning of construction in 2006 to about 6.5 billion euros expected to open next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is planned to be held in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike F<0xC3><0xB6>lster will switch to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked F<0xC3><0xB6>lster. She has put the airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: vending machines burst for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he chased several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of burst cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply.
The police arrested a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and on the Further Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik said: "In the course of the investigation into the detonation of explosives in fact with a particularly serious case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he apparently financed his drug addiction". The bomber alone had blown up parking ticket vending machines on B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The machine-gun bomber is now in custody and police investigations are continuing against him.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday an Austrian Airlines press release to APA.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings destinations, four will remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", that is to say, including Eurowings staff. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Germany from Salzburg to Vienna.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times will be adjusted to connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized traffic out of the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group sister airline AUA. Thus, more Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight A will be able to fly.
After the Niki Plait, a price battle broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which will be the trade mark for the company.
Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary’s campaign statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA board member Andreas Otto said on Friday: “We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, is said to have stopped by the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice, 31 at the beginning of the month, the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are thrilled to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to start this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in the official statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come this will help us a lot, full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the mating of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetics of 9000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) said on Friday. The K<0xC3><0xBC>hne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the essential influencing risk factors for comparing cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of the patient to the 8000 healthy people.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations, the clinic said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, for example, for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's Heart and Vascular Disease Center.
The chairman of the K<0xC3><0xBC>hne Foundation, Klaus-Michael K<0xC3><0xBC>hne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data to investigate other diseases. The K<0xC3><0xBC>hne Foundation’s clinic in Davos has been dealing with allergies so far. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine in Switzerland is to be established.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. In genetics encryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte from the University of Zurich (1000 bytes).
According to UKE, a person’s genetics can be decoded within 24 hours. The net cost for this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is to start on October 1, all 9000 samples are to be analyzed at the end of 2020, and the first results are expected in the year after that.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially minor victims, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims have been abused. Some of them have been accused of teaching Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés had been detained by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Residents had made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not been aware of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six police officers were arrested.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, therefore, in the last ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger.
Nigeria's police release 400 children from school after being chained and tortured
Police officers rescued nearly 400 students from horrific conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that hinted at torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumane". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, had been held as slaves at their school and placed in chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed skinny and injured students in a visibly poor state of health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messi and Klopp's K<0xC3><0xBC>r
Football "Signature not valid"
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup, accusations against FIFA come from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Much at FIFA has proven to be atrocious in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious sympathies according to its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA world football election has so far not been suspected of being unfair and nationalistic, if one abstains from it.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconveniences now occur: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account, in fact they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologized for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were submitted in capital letters and therefore not valid" and contacted the Egyptian Association several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan coach also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately rated: with Lionel Messi in the first place, Virgil van Dijk on the second and Sadio Mane on the third.
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you", he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The announcement came from the association on Friday: "Yes, but of course there was no intention. The completed election documents are available in the Official Gazette as well as in FIFA's name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a statement of the association. However, it was actually selected by the second captain, Manuel Rosas, "to vote for the appointment".
The other cases are now examined by FIFA in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Footballer's Choice - and J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: high-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against the U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump may be testifying. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here, is determined by the facts that are ascertained." He wants to be overruled.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump "observes Biden".
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, few have recognized the discomfort. Scott’s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly spoken out against Trump’s policies, for example, against the easing of environmental protection regulations and regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, have not formally agreed to the proceedings against Trump that will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, even the first senators of the Republicans have expressed themselves critically about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second House of Representatives, said the above-mentioned R.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an impeachment trial against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into this, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a process are therefore low. So far, no impeachment has occurred.
Were torturers on the board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering them in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she unwittingly boarded the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees at the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also from Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - she was arrested by Italian authorities after a day of house arrest.
Now new serious accusations against rackets are being made. Thus, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants "couldn't have re-opened their watchers in Italy.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. These were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - again and again - by being systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities".
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators will also be on the ships. "It is very important, therefore".
Italy’s right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk aims to set a delivery record at Tesla
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk continued. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to customers. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and upcoming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Just another bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate on Thursday followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending limits for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the federal government will once again be without spending plans before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has agreed to a transition funding (continued) on November.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal government is now being funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 that ends on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities 1, the federal government can not allocate the funds for the upcoming fiscal year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans, which are hardly capable of a majority.
The spirits differ mainly on the topic of allocation of resources for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently tried to force $ 12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats were disturbed by the wall construction plans and their funding, which was already in the process of building it for other militias.
At the construction of the wall, the spirits are separated
At the moment, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the persistent inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the resulting new risks of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process of gaining popularity are gaining back. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the federal government's funding would continue automatically at the level of the previous year's borrowings, while the Parliament's borrowings would continue to operate at the same level.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is also expected to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill allowing all women to have in-vitro insemination, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. The French bishops' conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by the social insurance company.
Fertilization with sperm of totem husband further prohibited
On the other hand, with a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past, in which women have been vainly accused of giving birth.
Numerous members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, had spoken out for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unfair that in the future a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy will continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - it is nevertheless often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: Calls for flight tax for Unis become louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate over a climate tax on flights from universities and universities has not been postponed since the summer break. The governor's conference has continued to be sceptical about the possibility of a coup d'état. The plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the governors of universities have called for the possibility of a coup d'état.
Russia Recaptures North Korean Fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea had already been arrested. At that time, there was a shootout between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman did not suffer serious injuries later.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information, the Russian Coast Guard patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid fish were discovered on the boats and confiscated, as well as information on three fishing and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority has also not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, according to complaints from local businessmen, and according to media reports, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been detained there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about the high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight mesh synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought from the sea, in addition, they would simply be caught in the sea.
Only 18,000 more in the future: U.S. lowers asylum ceiling
The “greatest nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shooting itself off against asylum seekers: as confirmed by the Foreign Ministry in Washington, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqi asylum seekers will receive.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 economic year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, as the U.S. Department of State explained. In the now almost expired economic year, the limit is 3 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically lowered the reception readiness of asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous administration of Barack Obama, much higher reception limits had been applied.
The targeted upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, but the State Department described the U.S. as “the most compassionate and generous nation in history,” a phrase strongly reminiscent of the current U.S. president’s use of language.
A “responsible approach” to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said, adding that his hard-line migration policy has received a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major sticking point is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to close. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under threat of a Selensky and Amescher Aff because of the Selensky threat.
The U.S. government, according to a statement from the Foreign Office, wants to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as indicated by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a trapping station for apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release was mandatory. However, the animal was not released by direct flight to Dallas.
Since the 53-kilogram human ape is unable to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the US Bay Area of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees housed there, among them "Bubbles", former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sadra County" still has to be around 40.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock at the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process for "Sandra's" basic rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000-metre-high Grosse Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other means, the Swiss forced the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Basin into a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of dizzyness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb, thus undercutting the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of Europe’s six most important northern walls.
Nike Takes Advantage of New Online Marketing Strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit increase. The net profit of its customers increased directly to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (almost $1.3 billion). That is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new online market.
Revenues rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period to the end of August, the strongest increase in Nike sales figures with an increase of 22 percent in China. This benefited the Beaverton group in the U.S. state of Oregon also in the People’s Republic from its approach to directly access the Verbrau via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief financial officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer’s “digital transformation” with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were happy to respond to quarterly figures – the sporting goods manufacturer’s shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a life-long stadium ban against a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private messages and urged his AS club to take action with "@Toificalasrom, what are you going to do?
The club responded late Thursday by reporting the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters will never be allowed to attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We can not have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out the stadiums between the A.C.
However, discussions had recently taken place about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 random fans of record champions Juventus Turin. Four of them are not expected to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the remaining four years, the bans apply accordingly.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigation into motion with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders were supposed to be behind the black-ticket trade, they had "military control" of the ticket trade for the fan curve, and they were supposed to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political – entire vintages are considered with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective way of life of young people?
"The Crabs are Coming!" This call officially launched on September 21st the Crab Catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also ushered in the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city offers the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically its ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent of water, all of which is equal to 20 percent of the mountains".
The people of Gaochun have already begun to breed crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the farming industry has developed into a more prominent urban industry, which has ensured high incomes and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively focused on a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and meticulously set up the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending", thus the city wants to include the environment for permits, for development and for services.
Gaochun takes advantage of the local culture by connecting to the southern region of jiangsu and the southern region of anhui, which has been fully equipped for tourism and uses the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a signpost for intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection.
Iran-U.S. conflict: Rouhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, after his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. The United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Rouhani describes the situation as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have all been present in New York and have urged that a meeting take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," Rouhani added, adding, "should have added to the kind of punishment they have imposed.
However, Rouhani criticized that this attack was not carried out in an acceptable way, and given the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, hopes that the U.S.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said the Turkish vice president Fuat Oktay on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged as a result. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktya announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is constantly ignored. Every year, poorly built housing collapses - among other things, must made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect M<0xC3><0xBC>cella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been listed as refuges in the center, have long been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the G<0xC3><0xB6>lc<0xC3><0xBC>k earthquake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquakes.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as the Afad disaster relief agency reported, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students were crying as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of earthquakes. Beneath the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. More than 17.000 people died at the time.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. In the earthquake on Thursday, it already hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need standing next to doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake comes, it’s unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Bezir.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings rocked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings.
The time of the quake is officially stated at 13:59 local time, just minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judge's scale.
Only on Tuesday, an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish marble region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the marble sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad said on Tuesday.
It wasn’t the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher S<0xC3><0xBC>kr<0xC3><0xBC> Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Turk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the big quake will also come."
Just a few weeks ago there was an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In Albania there was also a violent earthquake just a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New Ignition in Ukraine Affair
Two breaking documents provide new incendiaries in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment proceedings, the U.S. Democrats see themselves emboldened: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call to the U.S. president.
US: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane rerouted
As a result of a passenger being locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was diverted and the toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline said.
In the event of an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the tight cabin. For about an hour she was locked in it, US media wrote citing other passengers. To continue flying towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video posted on the Internet, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554, according to US media, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman.

The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes a Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it – and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation”, the British success author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will not be published in German on November 27, the Tagenes Verlag (Zurich) is involved in this. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at once becomes the most powerful man of Britain's will, and is en.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "If parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie shamelessly as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions plead the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself "what he can do about it."
Kafka's 1915 first published story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an enormous monster", is gradually excluded by family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands head", it was said by Diogenes.
EU invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.5 million in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce the noise load from freight trains. In addition, sections of the rail links between Graz and Gy<0xC3><0xB6>r and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
This is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the European Commission. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All Trips Cancelled Until October 31st
German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, one day after his application for insolvency. Travel could not be undertaken "for reasons of insolvency law", the company said on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. As it stands for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, it will be subject to further verification.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the trap of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer money to hotels from now on
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels will not be re-issued for the individual payment of hotel bills from now on".
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot, according to their own information. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook holidaymakers were still on the move from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who only want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31 would be canceled. This also applies to such bookings.
As for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be reviewed, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Explosion Mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has been continuing Lady Diana’s commitment, and in Africa he is now walking in the footsteps of his mother.
In Angola, British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed an explosive device while wearing a blue shrapnel vest.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, on Friday morning, he set the onslaught of the thousands of people in front of the TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded more in the savanna landscape without causing harm. Although the Halo Trust alone has more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the countryside, there is still
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana in the city of Huambo (1961-1997). With the same blast master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go the way she was going at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana had walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had also shown her support for the world.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a 10-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations stall: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him, there will be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations, not guaranteed. However, what statements have been made by the polarizing British since forever. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom hovers like a damocles sword over the bludgeoned, his suspension of parliament.
Boris Johnson still thinks the deal is possible
But the pressure doesn’t seem to go over well with Johnson either, and he’s hinted at a hospital visit in the meantime that in the event of a disagreement, he will support an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work out.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. Still around six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators will have time for Brexit negotiations to prevent Britain’s exit from the European Union without a deal. But even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October seems to be currently rather difficult to imagine.
U.S. Authorities: More Deaths from E-Cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are still reports of 805 confirmed and probable injuries in the United States, according to the U.S. health authority CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 cases, of which about 500 are confirmed.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The Spanish-born construction entrepreneur and actor calls for a "people's revolution" in it. For today's friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who are critical of corruption and misappropriation of Ali.
The security authorities are alarmed. In central Cairo, there was already an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in recent days, the police had tightened their road controls and the phones of pedestrians were partially connected to the news in the news.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend it was held in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protests with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not been held in Egypt for years. Correspondingly, the security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), since last week almost 2000 people have been arrested "because they want to be wrongly detained".
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, activists and bloggers have been turned away.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs back from Greenland expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by, among others, the skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. It has been known for decades that the earth was warming. Yet many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone had been measured with Greenlandic glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann in the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which provoked heated reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero.
Promptly came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the host.
U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be facing an impeachment process after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy. The accusation of the whistleblower against the government, who has brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint finally to the public, is monstrous: the president has taken the power of a coup d’état to another.
The core of this project is also to be found in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reproduce the full text. However, the phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which besides Trump is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reported that Mr. Rudy Giuliani's information for Ukraine would be very helpful. However, he says he wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selensky, and the lawyer himself knows very accurately that his intentions are "unusual. "We do not want to interfere in an election, we want to interfere in Ukraine."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump’s anti-Trump candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the United States.
It is about exactly the investigations that Trump will talk about in July on the phone with Selenskyi, who has so prominently vilified Ukrainen. The family's version of Giuliani and the president's investigation is that the former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has been vilified as Ukraine's representative of the Obama administration in the wake of the coup d'état.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general leave, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was by far not the only Western partner in his dismissal.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the UK and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allest<0xC3><0xB6>rungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 p.m. Also Instagram gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Even Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disruption, albeit not yet.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services were down for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also resort to Twitter, especially this time, to make their annoyance.
Polish Scientists Rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message that shortly before ten we were launched, and good 20 minutes later we were above the hose boat".
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases the battery
Researchers warn about the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick, the temperature is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With the wireless charging, the researchers have the ability to charge the smartphone even on the perfect alignment.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree does increase the iPhone. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last as long in total. So the life expectancy is lower. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone with a cable.
Practicing
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-in fume. Since the Qi (stands for inductive power transmission, can be used even if a global standard is used.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese climber has climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousandth in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of mountaineers standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of the mass avalanche triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and the highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th millennium: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to enable him to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fortress, which many tourists visited earlier. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously remained unharmed. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically responsible for their deaths.
British Oil Tanker Detained Leaving Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its capture by Iran. This was announced by the shipping office of Bandar Abbas according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker flying under the British flag on July 19 under the pretext of segregating.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to thoroughly investigate the case of the travel giant Thomas Cook. For example, we have to examine the salary packages of the board of directors as well as the question of why the British government was not allowed to jump financially to the company fighting for survival. "Our interest is in the supervision in the company as well as the control of the book".
Experts say genes are overestimated at colon cancer risk
The role of genes in familially increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits are therefore likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed.
Elon Musk to raise Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars, thus reaching its best value so far.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Does the British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reticent
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a close eye on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a corresponding question, he told reporters only on Friday that his government will stick to current law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is to be reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a deal with the European Union, saying, “We are confident to leave the EU on October 31 and the best way is with an agreement.”
Iran appears to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement in 2015 increased the pressure on the European treaty partners. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said on Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, urging them not to withdraw from the agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the pledge to Tehran to retaliate in retaliation against the economic relationship. The United States withdrew from the agreement in 2018 alone, in order to force Iran to change course in what was considered aggressively perceived to be the Middle East policy of Donald Trump.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now also using or at least preparing for the use of uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani suspected, but there will still be further talks that will hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the common situation has changed in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom have been following the US assessment that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran had been known to attack the US, but Roch did not do so.
"Those who make such accusations have to provide evidence," said Rouhani. However, the European leaders could not have done this during talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would have only relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this.
Rouhani called on the Washington government to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason" before possible talks with US President Trump would first have to lift the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration.
Comet from another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space. This has only happened once before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn to other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from deep space was named after its discoverer at 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not originate from our own system.
According to 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into an alien solar system—the farthest the object is from—before it disappears on near-revelation US speed. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canaries.
According to the analysis, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbelt orbit, which takes it out of our system - and clearly has its own interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It was also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the orbiter received the following information:
Astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on the way, leaving the researchers many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will be more professional until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, according to a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Photographs of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already discovered a first so-called comet-like spectra similar to those of the interstellar star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar to that of ours"
The discovery of the same two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such spotting visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors might be able to travel off a planned satellite mission.
The agency wants to station the three-part Comet Interceptor spacecraft (German for comet interceptor) at a standstill 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa science director G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Hasinger, it will either be waiting for a still-untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or waiting for an interstellar comet.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it's time: At the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
Around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled annually at the new airport by 2022, and 72 million by 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Seastars” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, and much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed until now. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic plane to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency dreams of the UK Space Agency. The aim is to make possible this, for the 2030s, highly targeted flight in supersonic speed could be a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed, and the US-based agent Ingenuity CNN.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate with the Australian aircraft. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis began to arrive at the United States Air Force. The aircraft used to arrive at the United States Air Force began to arrive at the United States Air Force in 2000. As so far the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transportation, the Concorde from 1976 until the cessation of its operation in 2003 had covered the route New York-Paris, and for this purpose.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is, five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also capable of being flown outside the Erphmos.
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy in New York on Thursday. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been treated "a little differently" in the past than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media outlets broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their accusations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who has raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On great public pressure, the statements of the whistleblower were made.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have information from several government officials that the U.S. president “uses the power of his office” to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the center of the allegations is a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, in which Trump is urging his colleagues to investigate allegations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, including earlier dealings by Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged attempts to stifle his impeachment efforts.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call. The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up: leading government officials had been specifically accused of trying to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been drawn up and this was made out of juxtaposition in the wake of the conversation.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may not be any tippers or spies at all.
As Trump spoke in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower, it sparked outrage. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his entourage have been underway in various committees for months, and given Ukraine’s allegations, Democrats are now pushing ahead with fresh investigations to launch a possible impeachment trial against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things, and again called for the committee chairman to resign. Trump insulted Schiff regularly and had already called for his resignation months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy fields, who were mostly working under Democratic but also Republican presidents, stood behind the Democrats’ investigation into a possible impeachment trial in a statement released on Friday. If the allegations were true, Trump would be “curious.”
There is no precise timetable for the next procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no impeachment has occurred in the US.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being "slowed down"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the automaker’s works council around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros will be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, a 20-hour work session applies.
However, as our newspaper learned from the working council circles, jobs in production that were not actually available will be "sliding" down another path - that is, past the official course. Thus, free regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing the re-occupation. In the meantime, there is a shortage of staff in many parts of the world, and there is a growing concern about the gradual depopulation of the vehicle plants. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally manage new projects. This also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - behind this lies the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times, the United States is threatened with trade from Brexit to China."
For example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for Golf 8, which will be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time are not called VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is 7 for the Golf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built there annually in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 70 percent.
As production director Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" one million cars will roll off the band. This is intended to make possible the bundling of the golf production in the main plant - because the plant Zwickau through the conversion to the site for the electric car production abandons the golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Golf 8. It should remain for the time being the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers, despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Forced into prostitution with Voodoo: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The accused had pushed young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the exiled Nigerians had one more female prisoner.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan locksmiths in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to handle the alleged locksmith costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Their salary was therefore completely taken away.
The defendants – four men and two women – had admitted the entrapment and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels during the trial. “The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women to do,” Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the sentencing. “Some were rightly opposed.”
The verdicts include commercial and gang-related entrapment of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, mercenaries and heavy forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union UFO has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform the LH Group on October 14 about the measures of struggle in the LH Group," said Daniel Flohr, Ufo tariff chief on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to conduct tariff negotiations with the Ufo.
At this point, after a decision of the labour court in Frankfurt, Ufo now sees itself strengthened. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective bargaining agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and, on the other hand, is considering bringing legal proceedings. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I believe, and Floscheinstand.
In August, Lufthansa had also filed an application with the Frankfurt Landesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) to have the status of the UFO as a trade union checked in court, arguing that the trade union had not employed a board of directors entitled to representation for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the branch union, in the course of which numerous members of the board of directors as well as the advisory board have resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had postponed a preliminary vote on strikes by cabin crews at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Ease of entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not known as an international tourist magnet, but that should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of paying international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“Saudi Arabia’s opening to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production collapsed dramatically, oil price shoots skyrocketed. It is expected that it will take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to reach its peak.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding.
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in the white wedding look.

Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed outfits on Instagram and asked his followers, "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding," according to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves a yes-word at a New York state office, and there was no bigger party at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently said that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has studied the stocks of all 454 known tree species in Europe. 265 of them are present on no other continent. Of these 265 are endangered.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "extinct from extinction" and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct". Altogether, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
Threatened by wild and wild horse chestnut
One of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency, “Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild Common Horse Chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN wild range. The greatest less threat is the Balkan Miner moth besides a mushroom. It has been spreading since the 1980s from Southeast Europe across the continent and has almost 1 natural enemies. IUCN
Bushes and moose are also in danger.
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of other molluscs and moose and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies mainly in the destruction of the wilderness, in towed species, in agricultural practices and in the climate.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. “We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority.”
Istanbul Earthquake: 34 Injured Reported
Dozens of people have reportedly left their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, according to Turkish media.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged as a result. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis of millions.
Oktay announced that Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said, adding that the government is now seeking to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
Underneath the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian Disturbance, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located at that time in G<0xC3><0xB6>lc<0xC3><0xBC>k, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
As early as Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake shook the region around Istanbul, prompting authorities to call on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be leading the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl in February 2020. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't get bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is excited to be at the Super Bowl on February 2.
Jennifer Lopez stated that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She can't wait to "show what we girls are doing on the world's biggest stage".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she feels honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos from the US and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "Kings" stood together.
Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, and her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining numbers of spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped viewership: This February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people at a time.
The halftime show of the last Super Bowl had been upset in advance: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the criticisms were few.
Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was in the 2016/17 season before NFL games, but at the National Anthem of March, we did not let him get down on his knees in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement to Donald Trump and the President of the United States.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face the cost of the lawsuit of travel provider Thomas Cook, which threatens high write-offs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the Financial Times in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write off as much as <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion) in total on their books, the report said, according to estimates by consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to buy off <0xC2><0xA3>900m to <0xC2><0xA3>1bn and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550m and <0xC2><0xA3>825m. The amounts actually to be written off are more likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
How large the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will show after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not spread too much hope. For example, the around 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the real estate are in bad locations. The most money you can sell it to the airport.
Rockets are believed to have brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy to torture and kill people in Libya. “We cannot rule that out, but we do not have any reliable information on that,” said Sea-Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators had been arrested in the detention camp in Messina, Italy. Neubauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify "who they left on their ships."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, while ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. The three suspects are also said to have arrived there that day. The captain is being investigated for aiding illegal immigration.
U.S. Warns Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust Chinese network equipment maker Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great,” Pai told the “trade sheet” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow the instructions of the security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” the FCC chief continued, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The German government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It would be “very hard to imagine” that a government agency “would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks no matter where,” the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the newspaper.
The U.S. has learned that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position.
Chemical factory in northern France is on fire: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky above a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and children's cribs in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture said. The Interior Ministry had asked citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals indoors, to feed them.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the extinguishment smell spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were in use at the site of the fire.
A giant black column of smoke had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told broadcaster BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first, but a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river, dams against the pollution had been built, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out in the early morning at about 02.40, the authorities reported. The cause remained initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Those states that have room for more investment should act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, referring to its country's high national debt, which accounts for more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "lowered," Le Maire said.
In recent years, French politicians have repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday foresees tax relief of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to 3.1 percent expected this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson evades question on Brexit tactic
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticizes the "capitulation law" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician does not.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a tight lid on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit – despite the latest law passed by parliament, which is supposed to prevent exactly that. On a corresponding question, Johnson told reporters only that his government will stick to current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is to be reached by mid-October, Johnson criticising this as a “capitulation law” that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could best try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exits. Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the EU on 31st October. "
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he feels the political controversy surrounding Brexit as a “walk in the park” and confidently showed that the desired exit from the EU will still be achieved: “We will enjoy it, we will win, we will exit (i.e. from the EU), no worries,” Cu said.
Cummings, who led the Brexit “Vote Leave” campaign during the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the chief strategist at the British government seat of Downing Street, to stand behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a nearly impossible situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it does not always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) deeply immerses into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. The illustrious guests also included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found it for photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, again and again one is in the spotlight: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephoned in his bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wore unformed moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on their farm in the south of England or in Scotland, she also led a very normal life.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It’s about the deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment,” said Paul McCartney. “If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment.
There is the light, the composition, the image cutout and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all the anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes already look like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran."
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel oil and gas imports from Iran, despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey was having problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "withdrawn due to U.S. threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey “will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran secretly pursues a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified significantly in recent months.
The U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department declared on Thursday that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. State Department said it would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as indicated by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The program, which was launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the 8th President, passed away.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced lowering of the upper border. “This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee. The US would thus further damage its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally as well as illegally - strictly. The U.S. government, according to its own data, expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Comes close to a tip"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying in the whistleblower case. Whoever gave appropriate clues to the whistleblower who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a tip," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York.
Accordingly, Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House now, he replied: "This comes close to a tip". Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times, when we were smart? Right, to go to the spies.
Observers valued the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment trial against him, the whistleblowers wrote in the premonitions.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now published complaint of having abused his office to solicit interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selensky in the summer. In the conversation, Trump filed a lawsuit against him.
It is not yet clear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but according to the New York Times, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst with the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddler drown in Aegean Sea
Time and again, people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where the boats are often much too small. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a inflatable boat, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died in the sinking of a rubber boat. Among the victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could be rescued from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
The victims are also said to be a smuggler, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr reported. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats, have been killed on this route since last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Cancelled the Concert
A U.S. concert by rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to a nuisance by lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "can't really talk right now". Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense at a compensation concert. However, a date is not yet set.
Performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver were cancelled by The Who. They are to be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office renter.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office renter WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company has suspended other companies from the London market, postponed the planned stock market entry, and started selling the private jet to executives to gain financial room for the week.
WeWork now rents out large office spaces in the long run and rents them out to members in part small units in the short term. This may be new freelancers, small start-ups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned money with this business at a staggering rate. Last year, the company drove in a loss of $1.6 million.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded leases with up to 15 years, resulting in liabilities of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations of the economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, DuWork rented offices in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWork's new contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the demand for those offices in New York.
In the UK capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without a further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis purchased last year by the savings fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable for the company soon, individual property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of income. Access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork they have in spite of the long-term limitations of WeWork.
Russia Arrests Many North Korean Fishermen Again
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 more poachers arrested in recent days who had fished illegally in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on the move in Russian territorial waters in 2018. In total, the Coast Guard of Russia, according to its own information, is conducting more patrols to protect its marine biological resources. In the re-checks, 30,000 squid fish were discovered. In addition, the information according to three fishing boats and two motorboats were confiscated from the Rikhoddi and after W<0xC3><0xBC>choddi.
The Russian fishing authority had also not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, according to complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to media reports, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, did not complain about the recent high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen themselves. They fished with tight mesh synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be brought from the sea. In addition, they would also be caught in the sea.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests the previous week. According to the FSB, a similarly wounded North Korean later died from his injuries. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second, after it had opened fire.
U.S. Bans Entry of Ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children, the U.S. State Department said in a statement Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he stands in front of a system in which thousands more Cubans would be arrested politically and will be imprisoned.
As the chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there, through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of force by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime, the Americans are blaming the crisis on the Venezuelans," said the statement.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued entry bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has raged for months. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to his knees and to the opposition leader himself to intervene.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of deployed doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in suppressing opponents of the government.
New Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning again actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are expected to make the start due to the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a large-scale rally in Montreal.
How big the global appeal will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far, as part of the strike week, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries.
Especially in Germany, the influx last Friday was very large. A good third of all the world’s demonstrators – around 1.4 million – wanted to go to the West in small towns or towns, according to estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities, but people want to go to cities such as Hamburg, Munich and Berlin.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the creation of the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short period of time. In the climate protests, students and academics are also taking part, but in increasing numbers.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe, especially under the Paris Climate Agreement, to reduce global warming to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-seas race racer Noh<0xC3><0xB6>chtung Svalbard, where she had recently taken part in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she delivered an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was insistent in her conscience with the heads of state and government of the world to talk to the world.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," an emergency ministry spokesman said Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass agency. The ban is expected to enter into force on October 1.
Those who still smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty will be higher. Under the ban, similarly burning candles fall, according to the Ministry. Even meat spits on the balcony are no longer allowed to grill.
Attack on Cybercriminals - Investigators elevating servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel.
This was reported by the Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Among other things, customers of the suspects were said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug market, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had crushed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence, for the first time in Germany, it said.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9 there have been searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as J<0xC3><0xBC>chen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backmen?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and factories of smoke that heat the climate. All the more surprising that even a 16-year-old girl keeps the mirror in front of the powerful people of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever merchandising of a willful mechanic?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up to America for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas from Cologne has been able to choose one for himself.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to get to the bottom of it? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely, thanks to the daughter of Gref and Gref.
Here the spirits are now divorced: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic to make certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world bailout? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society characterized by disillusionment.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently traversing our solar system.
Astronomers have confirmed that an alien comet is currently traversing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers have only suspected it, but now they are certain: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in the Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of its kind to be seen during the flyby.
The great chance for astronomers is now to catch up with close insights into an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar in origin and is currently moving out of our system on such a hyperstellar basis.
Comet has already been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been professionalized in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then only be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes", according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First Insights on Comet 2I/Borisov Awakens Hopes in Science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the tailings star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that it might be similar to comets in other solar systems, such as ours.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow for a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly occupied by the researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid crashed past the Earth and got dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely Reprehensible": Rachel Johnson is horrified about her brother
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly scourges the warlike language of the Prime Minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly preparing - at least verbally. At the question time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have come forward: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, dragged, quartered, teased and feathered" by the EU. She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother's "anti-Par," said Rachel Johnson, who was opposed to the election.
In particular, she came across that her brother, Jo Cox, was mentioned to be a "non-EU-friendly" member of the House of Commons, but she was criticized for having been killed by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory could best be honored by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said to himself in the House of Commons.
Cox's widow also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick if Jo's name is used like that," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is if you enter passionately and resolutely into what you believe in - no matter what your opinion is. But you should never be tempted to "demonize the other side."
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest over the past few months – it’s an indissoluble tension,” Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson's language was also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language, which is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, should not be aklepto.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL has set a strong mark: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming NFL Finals, the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida live many people with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German theaters from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected with excitement in the United States every time. This year many consider the selection also as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a giant advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a stir there. As a rule, at the NFL Finals, well over 100 million television viewers watch it in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was opposed by the group that refused to rise in protest against police violence against blacks, and for this, among other things, had been attacked by US President Donald Trump.
An actor and YouTuber beckons Egypt's ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether or not the streets of Egypt have been re-flooded, the President has not been able to leave, the President of the United States has spent the last week in exile. One of the two has been forced to return to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi has returned from the UN General Assembly, the former General of the Muslim Brotherhood, the former President of the United Nations, the President of the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, the United Nations, and the United Nations.
In the opinion of the president of the other man, who currently determines the happenings on the streets, he is trying to deceive himself. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained silent abroad, where he evades the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
He approaches the head of state directly and in a completely rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president swells in luxury and lets himself be built magnificent new palaces, it says there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second profession, he makes a lot of money with these gentlemen for 15 years.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's seizure of power, thousands of protesters protested against his rule, and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. That was really so many people in the streets, but they were not afraid to protest.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters last week threw banners with the portrait of the president, the muhrer wanted to be killed, the muhrer wanted to be killed, and on Friday massive police presence was reported. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city center were closed due to "maintenance work" of the streets, most of them.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in Barcelona on his video camera. "Let's not collide with police officers." But as a backslider, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be always much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Those who conclude an internet contract do not have to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for themselves in case of conspicuousness, how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the transfer rates promised in advance are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the consumer center Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of time for the provider, as a rule, of 14 days, to produce the promised service.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages, but if the success is not successful, only the lawsuit will help.
First-Ranked Republican to Investigate
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has called for an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are established,” Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday before impeaching President Donald Trump.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have acknowledged the discomfort. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policies, such as easing environmental protection laws and aggravating antitrust laws.
Spider-Man will remain in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the “Avengers” universe. It was completely unclear how to proceed with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several US media in agreement. According to this, the cinematic launch should also be fixed: In the US, the film is scheduled to start from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boost Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm glad that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are extremely pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to do what Spieme never does.
But what about the sudden good news? Allegedly, Sony Marvel is supposed to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
Princess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in 'Suits' finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the United States. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also included the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, in a charming way was paid tribute to the series.
One in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some glances once again showed the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the happy wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his departure.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was not mentioned in the "Suits" finale of "You Have to Know" 47 times, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just steps towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), he makes Harvey Specter (Gabriel M) a fortune.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drowned in boating accident
When a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea, a baby and four other children drowned. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French counterpart and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to inform Turkey about the "refugee situation", Seehofer said on Friday, and then to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to be able to help cope.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU interior minister Dimitris Avramopoulos and French interior minister Christophe Castaner on Friday.
In Greece, an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continued to arrive, with 654 people moving to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in the numbers has left doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey deal concluded in 2016. This means that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come illegally to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to send a Syrian refugee to every Syrian who was deported.
According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to staff shortages. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29,400 people in Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation in Lesvos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "very certain" to be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made all high temperatures and large temperature rises to reach people in a short time.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo-panel
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chef holds a reusable cup in her hand in a photo, but now it turns out that the cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite unnoticed for a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been published by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published as well as the national one.
Green boss has to take responsibility for photo-panel
The National Post then accused May of manipulative and that the party produces fake news to appear more credible on the issue of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an election campaign for the Lower House election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairperson to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and insisted on her blog that she did not know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she correctly stated that it was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokesperson for the party said that it was just about to get out on the site, not about the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked for something from her over-engaged team: "If they want to edit a picture again, can they not do something with my face, so I'm sorry?"
The German Greens also got into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoon during the holiday, as merkur.de reported*.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng allegedly received an upgrade via email from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-proclaimed influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure flight, Jaqueline’s employees refused to upgrade, even though she had shown an email in which her Cathay Pacific was allegedly planning to upgrade. The letter wants the influencer to have received from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman should have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked after at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originates, should have contacted the mail.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on flights with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because although Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to settle for this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices drop after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of global oil production to go down in mid-September. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A cease-fire in the region would make political inroads.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at the Saxo Bank news agency Bloomberg.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Bloomberg, citing insiders, had recently reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, so the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and was moving back towards the original volume.
Most recently, there have been multiple press releases citing insiders reporting rapid progress by state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to avoid a stock market run and negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries indicated: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the Iranian fixation and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still in front of anchor, at the Swede Reede.
However, the U.S. has announced plans to move missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as Iran’s arch-enemy, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain have pushed oil prices up sharply in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump escalate
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, "expected allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made intensive efforts, after a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, to deny access to the wording of the conversation.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit of Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first free agent summit in Singapore, said the top diplomat Kim-Ky.
The U.S. had done nothing to implement the summit’s decisions last year, the North Korean foreign ministry adviser said. He also criticized tougher U.S. sanctions and joint military maneuvers by the U.S. and South Korea, but hoped for a “wise” and “courageous” decision by Trump to bring it closer together.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to do so, but the talks on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers to help with mine clearance
Dressed in a blue shrapnel vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically ignited and destroyed a bomb on the way to Lfeiffen. Close to this camp of the British Halo Trust in the town of Dirico, he made the fuse. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With the aim of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, all of them are going to be mine-free.
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early interest rate reduction, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt speculations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates soon add to the pound sterling, with the British currency trading up 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The triggers of the sales were statements of the central banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rates into the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement was surprising, as Saunders said of a restraining of funds.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strain on the economy caused by the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary even without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and current head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the athletics World Cup, new details about the doping scandal in Russia appear - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only gradually recovered. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Cup.
In December 2014, the sport was revealed to be a systematic fraud in Russian sports. After that, the Wada had been in neutral with the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee left the country after individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio.
Lack of Positive Findings
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases during state doping. They should help to subsequently punish athletes. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now obtained the data Wrench. However, it has been confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interviewer's interview.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organization to be banned from Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put the manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to re-block the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
