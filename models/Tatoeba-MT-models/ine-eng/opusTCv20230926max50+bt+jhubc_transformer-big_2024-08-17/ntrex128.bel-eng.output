However, there are a number of other people who are worried about what they look like as a marionette.
Some MPs do not understand why their MP status should change to the status of "Member of the Parliament of Wales".
Deputies were outraged by plans to change the name of the local assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
All political parties believe that this is a violation of human rights.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it was rife with the words “stupid” and “bad luck.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid", and pwp means "unlucky".
She said that her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservatives said their group was ready to discuss changing the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a brief word-for-word transition from a member of the Welsh parliament to a "marianat".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now drafting a bill on the introduction of amendments to the name, made a statement: “The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the assembly call will, of course, be a question of the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals, which showed widespread support for naming the meeting as the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional deputy, the Commission preferred the Members of the Welsh Parliament or the CPC, but the CPC option received the most support during public consultations.
The additional deputies obviously offer alternative options, but the path to consensus could be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a bill on the changes over the course of a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called when they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
The national vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their northern neighbor represents a claim to their territory, which has hindered Macedonia's inclusion and friendship with the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a cost that must be paid for joining the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The Church of St. Martin is silent, the churches in Harlem are fighting for existence.
“In the past, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“There’s no one else here today.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People have different kinds of relationships and relationships at the moment,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the cozy living rooms where people walk around all the time.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help the temples that will remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will accelerate the day when these churches close together, because it’s unlikely that a handful of people who will move into these condominiums will become these people.”
Both churches were built by a white community before Harlem became a black area – the Church of the Metropolitan Municipality in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original White Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which was praying nearby, got the right to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was captivated by a black-skinned community led by the late John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on the main shopping street in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote black-skinned people.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the faithful under the direction of Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they put the carillons into operation.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "called poor people".
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it another way: "Cultural treasure" and - "an irreplaceable historical tool".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by black-skinned musician Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to a larger carillon in Riverside Church.
Mr. Meryvezer said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The meeting of the faithful – the governing body of the parish, which consists of the chaplain’s assistants – was written to the diocese in July with a warning that the diocese was “trying to transfer the expenses” to the meeting of the faithful, although the meeting did not participate in hiring architects and consultants, who were hired by the bishops.
Some have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy during a dive to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who hunted lobsters in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near the beach of Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then rushed in with the others to help pull him out.
At first, Hamel thought it was just an excitement from the lobbyists, but then he “understood that something bad had happened: ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
“All his key was broken,” said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: “In the water next to the shark!” – added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to the Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The identity of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Lara Giles said in a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks earlier, but was determined to be a safe species.
Giles added that the victims had suffered injuries to the upper body.
Officials closed approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Svami in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening up departments with beauty products in department stores where trained specialists will work.
As part of a significant push into the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds sterling, which continues to grow, while sales of fashion clothes and household goods are declining, larger beauty houses will also be represented in 11 other salons across the globe.
Investments in the sphere of beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on shelves that were previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those that can be found in stores such as Boots.
Large stores are also relaunching their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming more and more in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will be testing the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second to open in Sally-Owl (Birmingham) later this year.
Online shopping and the move to buying small quantities of products every day in local shops near the house leads to the fact that supermarkets have to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cooper, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that retail outlets will be more and more like department stores, as a network of supermarkets tries to compete with Aldi, Lidl's distributors with a greater number of services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos trading points in hundreds of stores, and has also placed several Habitats points since it acquired both networks two years ago, which it said contributed to the growth of food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to reconstruct their departments of beauty and pharmacy did not end successfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split the proceeds from the drugstore ended after a series of squabbles in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged three years ago after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy network for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was stated that Lloyds played its part in this by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed with every need in mind, and the attractive setting and convenient location make us the best home of beauty, which is opposed to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby gave up on the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million s.r.l. deal.
Star Dragons Den Peter Jones was furious after TV host Holly Willoughby refused to trade 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer.
Willowby doesn't have time to brand products for home and accessories Truly.
The business of the couple became similar to the brand Gwyneth Paltrow Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old leader announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was furious when the "golden" television girl admitted during her tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakinghamshire), that her new deals in the amount of up to 1.5 million euros.
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and was doubled to double Willowby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: "Truthfully, Holi's best friend.
This was her long-term future, which she will see in a couple of decades.
Its decision to refuse has left all the participants absolutely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was supposed to start dinner very soon.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, can cost the company millions because of the huge investments in various goods – from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as because of their power
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willowby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined the post of chairman in March.
The couple is vacationing together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television company.
Willowby will become a representative of the M&S brand and will replace Aunt MacPartlin as the leading ITV "I am a celebrity".
Last night, a source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on his case.”
A Conversation “After We Fall in Love”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comments, which he considers "non-presidential" because it speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump refusing to do so much?
Trump said in his “dictatorial” voice.
“I don’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have come to a standstill.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, told the world leader at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for "appropriate measures" by the United States in response to the previous steps taken by the United Nations.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are building a very successful relationship with North Korea,” he said.
“It could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have a good relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
“Being on the president’s side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’ll already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lambok v. foreign NGOs said that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lambok has been resettled, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary condition for the provision of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is collecting a team for a trip to Palo, it is not clear whether foreign employees can work on the site.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if the international agency would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always plagued Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the unexpected of nature.
Although they were built in Achaea, they are almost non-existent in other coastal villages.
The apparent lack of sirens to warn of a tsunami in Palu led to more casualties, although there was a warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
In addition, natural disasters have complicated the logistics of transportation.
The hospital ship, which was placed on the island of Lambok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Pal, but the path to a new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Vidoda has focused his pre-election campaign on improving Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and has spent money on auto roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is haunting the Jock administration as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of prolonged interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
Daniel Starrj from Liverpool throws the ball far away against Chelsea <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Daniel Starrj saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League, equalling the score at the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
The old man received a pass from Jerdon Shakira when they were about 30 meters from the Chelsea goalie, who led with a score of 1-0.
He made a fine ball to the left of himself before making a shot in the far pole.
The attempt ended in a high kill under the top bar, when the ball flew to the right of the top corner of the net.
As a result, the ball flew over the head of the cap of Arizabalagi, which jumped, directly into the net.
“He was just trying to get into this position to throw the ball, and players like Shak always tried to push as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible,” Starr said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Cante was running, made an easy pass without thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the start of the second half after Belgian star Eden Azar was killed in the 25th minute.
Attacking the Blues in this match, he made a pass to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> before returning to the semi-defence zone and running in the half of the Liverpool field.
Kovach quickly found himself in the center of the field.
He then made an effective strike, passing the ball to Azara at the gate.
Hazard rounded the defender and punched in the lower left corner at the long pole past Liverpool guard Elise Becker.
"Liverpool" competes with "Naples" in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 o'clock on Wednesday at the stadium of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo in Naples, Italy.

The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, a representative of the Sutopa agency Purvo Nugroha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday and caused waves of elevation to 7 meters.
The city of Palo Alto, home to more than 380,000 people, has been engulfed in rubble.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he stabbed a woman.
The investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with stab wounds in the Grayson Museum area on John Street, and the 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people from the area to contact them who had seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead or saw or heard anything suspicious and ask them to contact us.
I also urge everyone, particularly taxi drivers, video recorders who may have taken some video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
Today, the woman's friends came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Museum, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his voice when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will be a few hours before they are allowed to return.
The police explained to one person that the entire area is now a crime scene.
The woman was crying at the scene.
She said, "It's so horrible."
At 14:00 two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing inside the perimeter, investigating the multi-storey building.
Anyone who has information should contact the @MerPolCC police department, call 101, or contact the Criminal Police Department anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling 247 as of September 30.
The Parliamentary statue of Cromwell was the last century-old blow in the case of “rewriting history”.
His removal would be poetic justice for his similar to the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the course of the current debate on the dismantling of the statue, it was inevitable that the monument to Oliver Cromwell near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century thought and part of the history of the figure, which many believe should still be honored.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell has been better known since the end of the 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of long-standing historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure who represents one of the sides of this clash.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and honored by them.”
The killer pig was decapitated until the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by swine in the market in the southwestern part of China.
“The man, known only by his last name – Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery and blood clot, next to the mud on the Lupanshi market in the province of Guizhou,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The swine fever vaccine was scheduled to be introduced in the swine flu outbreak on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, China's Xinjiang province.
He, along with his cousin, is reported to have arrived on Wednesday from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring sweatshop was open.
He said that there was a large book with blood on it in the sweatshop.
According to the report, the forensic medical examination confirmed that the 550-kilogram booklet deprived the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were uncovered and damaged,” said a cousin named Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
A video from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases when pigs attack people are rare, but they have been before.
So, in 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, as a result of which the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pushed the Welsh farmer to its tractor and held on to it until his wife threw the animal away.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just gorgeous.
They're smart and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them a fair amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, "Rosa" will bring floods in northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
The speed of Rose, a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
“Rose” is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a low-pressure area, moving eastwards, to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday "Rose" will approach the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to swell to a scorching
On Monday, Rosa will bring in some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of rainfall.
Then the tropical humidity, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, in the coming days will cause strong lilies in the south-west.
Places from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous flash floods, mudslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause the number of rainfalls in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected.
Due to the disaggregated areas of the tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible, provided the conditions deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go out on foot in the desert due to the possibility of the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to turn into stormy rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by wind and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will bring heavy rains to places in part of the Southern California coast.
Possible total precipitation of more than a half can lead to a small stream of garbage and make slippery roads.
This will be the first day of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday before the rains go everywhere at the end of Monday and on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be strong temperature changes in the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of sharp temperature shifts in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (state of Missouri), and Amaya (state of Nebraska), St. Louis and De Moyne (state of Iowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States will begin a warm October with a temperature of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to the Northeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have watched the hearings of Brett Cavan.
More than 20 million people across six television networks watched interesting testimony by witnesses on Thursday in the Supreme Court's case between Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, with broadcasters interrupting their regular programs in favor of the extraordinary news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it consisted of a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to pull off her clothes at a party at a senior school.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100% sure it wasn't.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were likely to be watching it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that demonstrated this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And in the Nielsen company, there are usually problems with the evaluation of people watching TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the playoffs or the Oscars.
“The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported Kavan’s appointment, managed all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
The interest remained high even after the hearings.
Flake was the main character of the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to get up on the elevator at a courtroom hearing.
He stood with his eyes peeled for a few minutes while he was being lied to, and it aired live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, but many women are not.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and reported before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live for several hours, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on the issue of the removal of the candidate of Kwana at the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so only by understanding that the FBI is considering charges against the candidate next week, which Democrats are calling for from among the minority.
Flake was convinced in part by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a discussion with Coon and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was powerful, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the FBI's allegations against Kwan.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of planning to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page of the newspaper was her former foreign minister Boris Johnson, who spoke out against her so-called "shadow" Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EC should have single tariffs was "no" tariffs.
The murder of Wade Sims: Police arrested LSU player Dytheon Simpson, who was suspected of murdering him.
Police arrested the suspect in the fatal shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player on the Louisiana University team.
“The 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison on charges of second-degree murder,” the Baton Rouge police department said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
“The police removed the glasses from the scene and said they were found to have Simpson’s DNA,” CBS affiliate WAFB said in a statement.
After questioning Simpson, police said that he had confessed to a fatal shooting in Wade.
“The cost of the facility is set at $350,000,” Advocate reports.
The investigation into the East Batan Rouge administration published a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
A department of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, a state police crime lab, and Southern University police are asking residents of the area for help with an investigation that would facilitate the arrest.
Sports director of the University of Louisiana Joe Aliev thanked the district's law enforcement agencies for their "vigilance and commitment to justice."
Sims was only 20 years old.
Attacking a 6-foot tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the Louisiana University team.
On average last season, he scored 5.6 points, 2.6 picks per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what I’m always worried about,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City.
The ash, which is erupting from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Warning on Saturday offered Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and within 24 hours, 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded.
There was a noise in the center and there was a commotion.
Images on social networks have shown that in the outskirts of Mexico, such as S<0xC3><0xA1>cim<0xC3><0xAD>lka, there are thin layers of papal coating on the car windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeast of the capital after an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
The meeting of the police with the Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after supporters of independence clashed with police for the protection of public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the polarisation vote by the Catalan branch.
A group of masked separatists, who were held back by the police for public order, threw them eggs and blossomed with powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their spears to restrain the protesters.
Over the course of several hours, a group of independence fighters chanting “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” came face-to-face with trade unionists shouting “Long live Spain.”
According to reports in the local press, 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the course of the protests.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was marked by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry protesters.
Pro-independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police force.
The protest continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is present at a separate protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for the prospect of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired,” he said.
Despite the vital but insignificant victory in the regional elections in December of last year, the Catalan parties, which are in favor of independence, have tried hard to maintain momentum this year with many of their most famous leaders, and have turned out well.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was caused by politicians from both sides.
“It’s getting more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in SIZA since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Exclusion as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: A man was arrested after he ransacked his house in a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in the Belinhardt Crescent area on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, a bullet may have been fired from the car.
As a result of the blow, Mang "Livingstan" wins over "Rangers" with a score of 1: 0
The first goal of Doli Mangi in favor of "Livingstan" ensured them a victory
Livingston's success assailed the Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerard after his several defeats in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Mangy's fate was great, as Gary Holt rose to one level with the Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team will not win this season at the start of the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders, the Harts team, who lag behind by eight points.
Prior to that, the Rangers in the Europa League will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued his losing streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt is still reeling from a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses opportunities due to rude visitors
Holt's team was supposed to have warned long before they were killed, but the same direction caused a variety of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill in the gate, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Hulkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
That's how the main goal was achieved.
A penalty shootout was allowed by the Rangers, and Livingston made their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Meng, who made a pass and shot from the center of the field.
By this time, Rangers had dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team was inadequate, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost uninvolved.
The same thing happened in the second half, although Alfredo Marellos really saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pitman was knocked off by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and the Lithos fared away from the second set of Livingstone.
Balls were constantly thrown at the gates of Livingstone and were beaten, while two penalty kicks, after Chalket was called in to replace Glen Middleton, and a penalty for playing the hand, were rejected.
"Phenomenon" of "Livingstan" - analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alasdeir Lamant at the Arena Tony Macaroni
Phenomenal performance and results for <0xC2><0xAB>Livingstan».
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to surpass expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have hardly changed since their return to the upper echelon, but it is worth giving Holt credit for how he stimulated the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warall everywhere on the field.
The Rangers didn't get any inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match they did not own the ball, only once having scored in the goal, which was something of a distressing call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the list.
In the face of Erdogan's opposition in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, there were smiles and groundless applause when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over problems with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an headed to Cologne to discover a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkish residents outside of Turkey.
Police relied on security considerations to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from rallying in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also voiced their opinion, condemning both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him into the country.
Protests for and against the president's visit reflect differences over a guest who was hailed as a hero by one German Turk and condemned as an autocrat by others.
DTZ in Deptford: A driver was killed in a collision with a car
The driver was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, medical workers arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after another driver died as a result of a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the Saturday crash.
According to the police, their employees are working to identify the man and inform him about his next of kin.
Near this place there are road fences and bus stops, and the motorist was advised to avoid this area.
Long-Larcin Prison: Six Employees Injured in Riots
“Six prison officers were injured as a result of riots in a strict prison for men,” the Penitentiary Authority reports.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in the Upper East Side around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
In order to combat riots involving eight prisoners in one wing, the special group "Tarnada" was attracted.
At the scene of the accident, the employees were treated for minor injuries.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were sent to fight those who committed riots in the Long Lartin prison.
Six of the patients were treated after receiving treatment for their injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be transferred to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Royal Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, public order police officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were subjected to an attack with balls for the water polo.
Hurricane "Rosa" threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with heavy flooding (which can be beneficial for arid regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week, because there are traces of the "Rosa" hurricane in the southwestern part of the desert that pose a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service on Monday and Tuesday published data on flash floods in western Arizona and in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Latium, and Latium.
It is expected that on Tuesday "Rosa" will go straight through the Phoenix, approaching with rain in the evening on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a drop in pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts a fallout of 2 to 4 inches, while in separate places the level can reach 6 inches in the Magellan area of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual result values can reach 4 inches.
For those who are outside the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited, as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be beneficial, as droughts are currently being observed in the south-west.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, at least a little more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing an extreme drought of the second category,” Weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will face colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore cool.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm arrives, there will be an outlet of rivers from the coasts by day or in the evening on Monday.
Falls in different parts of Mexico can be severe, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“The total precipitation is expected to range from 3 to 6 inches from lower California to northwestern Sanllar, where precipitation is likely to reach up to 10 inches,” the weather.com report said.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning on Tuesday in the form of a tropical drop in pressure, which will then continue moving through Arizona and the southern part of the state of Utah until evening.
“The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remains, it is very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the Southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and landslides in the mountain area.
The attack on Midsomer North: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple stab wounds in Somerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terasa Excelsior area in Midsomer North at around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a “stable” condition.
“The 17-year-old boy and the two others, aged 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Somerset areas,” police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what had happened to move forward in their search.
“Cavano is reeling from the subjugation and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for repealing the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was “suffering from the subjugation and anger” of the Democratic Party during the process of his removal.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blaise Ford that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence during the hearings on her charge.
On Saturday, the President said that “on this day, Americans have seen a brilliant, quality and courageous character” Kavanaugh.
“The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer with a great history of public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president has drawn close attention to the withdrawal of Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of the emergence of Republicans in the interim elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not just late, I’m really late,” he said.
“That’s why I’m always fighting for great candidates.”
Trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to “oppose and hinder.”
“It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the removal of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday,” the senior parliamentary assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing
“At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves of six meters (18 feet) high battered the coast in tributaries, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
Following the earthquake, a magnitude of 7.5 occurred in the tsunami.
“When the threat of a tsunami arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
“Tunami dragged cars, barbed wire, houses, hitting everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the shoreline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape from the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photos, published by the Natural Disasters Agency, showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, the masts rolled and collapsed, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
The next wave of attacks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the assessment and use of technologies (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday is about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage “wide” and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
“The casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Pal, an area called Donggal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake,” Nugroha said.
The link to Dongal “was completely damaged,” Nugroh said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could have been much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not reporting on the tsunamis in Pal, but officials say the waves came at a time when a warning was made.
In amateur photos posted on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting out to people on the street a warning about an impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall fell to the shore, dragging the buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the removed material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage, which disrupted communications around the Pole, so it was difficult for the authorities to agree on rescue actions.
According to the authorities, the military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still very much needed food and other items of the first necessity.
The city's airport was only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vadodara planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost their lives.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danggala successfully made their way to the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in the frosty hiding places set up in the court of their office, along the way they saw the scenes of devastation,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to act in the dark to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with in-depth knowledge were being prevented from going to Pal.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, the press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares, “Well, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up to international aid, but that status is not there yet.
On the second night in Pale, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be among those who would leave the joyless storylines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and her child's body was next to her.
Handon Subandona, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paraplans for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, were his disciples.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Handon told how, hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel's destruction spread among the paraglider community, he was desperate to send messages on WhatsApp to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with a single gray dot, rather than two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during the replenishment of ATMs in Newport on the Levy
“On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker named Brynko, who deposited banknotes in an ATM in Newport, Libya,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was ready to deliver more money,” wrote Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, another man “escaped because of the employee of Brynko” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene of the incident, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: Rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Rapper Kane West (Kanye West) changes his name to Ye.
After announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "I'm officially known as Kenny West.
West, 41, by nickname Ye, used this nickname as the name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes are taking place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande with a show that was canceled for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Along with shortening his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
I believe “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it’s “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
It’s me, it’s you, it’s me, it’s us, it’s all of us.
It went from “Caney,” which means “alone,” to simply “Ye” — a reflection of our good, our bad, our lost, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former employee, Jay-Z, also acted without a connection and general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful residents
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
On Saturday, in the square of Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the military to subdue the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military staged a peaceful demonstration on the square, which resulted in the deaths of about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were entrenched throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving out monthly grants to those who study, thereby opening up more free places in state universities.
“Unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs,” he said.
The U.S. should double funding for machine intelligence.
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and machine intelligence expert at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about ME, even though the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovations.
“A budget increase for research in the MI area would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S., and we look forward to the next breakthrough in the MI area,” Lee said.
“The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that MI’s next big achievement will be in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in the company itself.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American player Atel, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Competition for Advanced Research Projects in Defense, and asked if there would be the next one to help identify the next windows.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking away academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have in recent years hired lighthouses from universities to work on MI.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of MI,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
“China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other state-run organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is better than that in China.”
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a United Machine Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Agency for Advanced Research projects in the field of defense announced investments of $ 2 billion under the name AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research at MIT.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which sought to establish a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence, has not followed suit for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will allow them to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed joining NATO and the EC.
In June, the two governments struck a deal to take into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgiy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question of voting in the referendum proposes: “You are in favor of membership in NATO and the EC with the adoption of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a cost that should be paid for admission to such bodies as the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not a necessary legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no reports of violations were received until 1 a.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when it was voted out by 66 per cent of registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Jose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje, said.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Duskko voted in favor of a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the name of the country, which will open the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and laid out the chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want a union with our heads up, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will be ‘yes’, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia, says that 30 to 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's TV channel, showed 57 percent of respondents who plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted yes.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its arrival in May last year.
Watch: Sergey Aguero of Manchester City passes through the gates of the entire defense of the "Britain"
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem of defending from the "Britain" by winning "Manchester City" with a score of 2: 0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguirre easily did it.
The Argentinian attack got a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of "Britain" before hitting an open field.
Aguirre was among the four green shirts.
He went over one defender and overtook several more on the edge of the British field.
He then pushed the pass to the left flank, finding Sterling.
The Englishman, attacking with the first touch in the penalty, gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right-hand shot to bypass the gate of "Britain" Matthew Ryan by striking the right part of the net.
“Aguirre has some problems with his legs,” Pep Guardiola, the city’s mayor, told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the same time.”
But that's exactly what gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguirre received this ball in the depth of the territory of "Britain".
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sean made a few touchdowns before Sterling was able to reach the long pole.
Assaulting Sky Blues sent the ball into the net before it jumped over the border.

Chertzer wants to play the role of "selection points" against Roki
After the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the constantly competitive Chertzer hopes to take the hit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences of the playoffs for the Rockies remaining in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
The years won at least a spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just like that, at least we can deal with the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will be so that the game is probably going to be at the highest level of all that.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Chertser the ball in such a situation.
Chertzer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the KPZ on Thursday and will be on a regular vacation on Sunday.

Trump's speech in West Virginia
The president has drawn close attention to the situation surrounding his election of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the great, the great – I’m not late, but I’m really late, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to return to power, using any necessary means, you see, – subjugation, vice.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to stop to get power and control, it’s what they want, it’s the power and control we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats intend to “oppose and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, reverse, and lying.”
He appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous recognition of Senator of the Democratic group Diana Feinstein, who received a loud evaluation from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the document to escape?
Uh, that.
No, I’m not waiting – it was a very bad non-verbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an apathy towards those who express their opinions.
"When Momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of members of parliament from the Labour Party who are told that we are not welcome – all to express their opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship exposed me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the irony of fate, similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting, which was conducted on Friday by the Nottingham East Labour Party, says that "we want these meetings to be both productive and up-to-date".
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, that's exactly what the meetings were on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a “better, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed ever there was.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not allowed in a Labour party, and every opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously believed I would share the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would in no way agree – the question was asked.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there are a bunch of images on social media calling for the election to be cancelled, condemning the center’s policies, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I've been lucky more than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the flow of sexual or racial harassment on a daily basis, but never shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that adheres to different views, and with each movement of “uncertainty” or a change in the rules of selection the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that has urged me not to fall in love, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, driven by the government of Thatcher’s grudge, which will make my schooling illiterate, I have sought to advocate for the best public services for those who most need them.
I've never had my own political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have been at all confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if a country is heading for a Brexit that is hurting the household, the business and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my constituents, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of abrogation of the election and political expediency will not prevent me from doing so.

Air-Melrose 38 - 17: Invincible Air on top
The two later attempts may have somewhat stated the final result, but no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting match of the Premier League of Tennant.
Now they are leading the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
In the end, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances that made them masters, coach Peter Murchi mercury had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far, and we’re still invincible, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give the proper Eyre, he's braver than we are."
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Fraser Klima, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to shake the numbers, and Jason Baghghot ss.
Klimau stretched Eira's lead with a penalty before, directly on the break, he shot, and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Eira on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Bagot, reduced the backlog to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Not, which was stretched, and after a restart Air advanced further through an attempt by Stafford McDowell, implemented by Klimov.
Air, while performing the duties of Captain Blair McFerson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking Klimov out of the penalty line without a ball, McPherson landed behind Eyre.
Klimov implemented his attempt, which he did again almost after the restart, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong in the penalty shootout and sent flanker Gregory Henry on the fifth try of the field's hosts.
Star Still Game Looks Like It's Ready for a New Career in the Restorative Business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is about to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show he writes, and is filmed alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the next ninth series would be the last in the show series, and Kernan seems to be planning to act further after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kernan hoped to take part in the "flowering trade in Glasgow".
"Our Sea": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Moroccans are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The buildings are under the blue flag.
In the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto "Our Sea by right" is painted.
It is our duty to renew.
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, is still alive – as is the attempt to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached a peak in recent decades as Bolivia waits for an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bali has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it is expecting a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calsadilla.
Many Balinese will be watching the decision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague, after decades of intense negotiations, will support the statement of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to conduct negotiations on the provision of the sea to the faithful.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a conflicting battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that's little to change, even if it does.
The United Nations, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to take a decision on the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments were considered, indicates that the case “was not complicated”, – said Chilean expert in the field of international law Paz Zarate.
And far from advancing the affairs of Bolivia, the last four years may have thrown it back.
“The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Balinese administration,” Sarat said.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Mar<0xC3><0xA1>lez has lost the rest of the Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Radr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velte, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Mar<0xC3><0xA1>les – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the maritime problem as a political support.
“Bali will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“It’s an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can be trusted by the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ry Yong Ho, says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
He spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restoring nuclear-tampering diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong-un more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it is an “inevitable dream” that long-standing U.S. sanctions and objections to the declaration of an end to the war in Korea will ever put the North on its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, we saw the newest line in massive headgear on the way to the stores in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the podium a lot of unusual headgear for their SS19 collection, which exceeded expectations from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram gained popularity with impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
A distinctive feature of Valentino was a luxurious beige hat, embellished with wide, feather-like fields that filled the heads of the models.
Other unusually large accessories included precious stones decorated with watermelons, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
However, Brown also showed a selection of magic masks - just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks were with mouths sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One of them resembled a figure for underwater swimming with a tube and protective eyeglasses, and the other – similar to a melted cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to strongly adhere to the huge attributes of fashion, you're in luck.
Those who follow the style, predict that huge hats can penetrate into our daily life.
Large hats go on the heels to "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields, which can be seen in everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Rataykovsky.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was released in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the podium – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model with this bag, dressed in a swimsuit.
The dark orange raffle bag, decorated with a raffle skirt and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has made a big impact, and it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have maintained achievements in academic success, it has continued since 2018 with yet another outstanding result of exams that is underpinned by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for the further higher education they have chosen for their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it stays in their head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a clear reminder that we can't just rely on the English language if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we see that languages occupy the first place in league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in learning Chinese, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Currently, languages as subjects are chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, among the reasons that employers have brought about difficulties in filling jobs, 17 per cent were linked to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a future career.
Taking into account the more promising jobs that require knowledge of languages, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of who chooses a profession when you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you will possess such skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person in the first place among the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak well enough in a foreign language to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage — 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in it.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK in terms of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, in independent schools there will always be a choice of several languages with a teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as “the skills of international communication.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference to young people in Scotland.
This has to be done
John Edward – Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The start of the wait for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing at the pre-season opening on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's gone is yet to be determined.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel wrote that James is likely to play for a limited amount of time.
According to the practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for “six game pre-season schedules.”
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is launching a number of shares of the company.
It's the first of Trump's five scheduled appearances next week, including stops at friendly venues, Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirming the vote on arrival at the election to fill the Supreme Court's post, Trump seeks to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the votes are cast.
When does Trump's speech start tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's speech in Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia on the Internet below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely this week to look at a candidacy hearing in Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh, who is having trouble on charges of sexual harassment with an expected Senate confirmation vote for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to provide assistance to the Republicans who are facing an election in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at “activating the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the majority they have in the Senate.”
“Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the busy pre-election campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today’s action could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morisse, who is a leader in the polls.
“This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come to try and give him a push in the polls,” Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider's Cup 2018: U.S. team advances to fight to keep hope alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's four may have been exactly what was needed for this Rider's Cup.
The pendulum of the swinging impulse is a completely invented sports concept, in which the players sincerely believe, and nothing more than a similar competition.
So where would they say the impulse now?
“They had the advantage of six points, and now they have four, so I think we’re going through it with a little momentum,” Jordan Sleepy said as he walked through the day.
Europe's lead, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game there are twelve more.
Americans, Spitch says, feel like they've been slightly blown up, and they have something to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Space was deadly from t-shirts to green and is an example.
These harrowing shouts of celebration became louder as his round lasted, and he sunk a decisive blow to play in a four-field match as they and Thomas retreated two-by-two.
His punch, which allowed them to win the 15th game, was met with a similar scream, like the one that tells you he believes the American team is not off.
“We just need to go deeper and worry about our own match,” Spiti said.
All of these players have already left.
18 to make a mark.
Over the past two days, the only players to have scored more points than Spade and Thomas are Francesca Malinara and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but charming couples in Europe four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
The Maldives were the only pair that didn’t make the gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and the second half of the day on Friday.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this tumultuous crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close the potential victory in Europe than the Gulf of Le<0xC3><0xB3>n on Sunday.
Both are desired at the same time on different holes.
The debate over the European Union's future is still ongoing.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's Furshat, when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
Boggi and two doubles on the front nine kicked out a Spaniard and a Swedish to him, from whom they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your lawn.
The four-ball matches and the four-ball matches are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairings, the parade they give, the parade they don't perform, and how the strategy can change at a moment's notice.
Europe has so far become the best team and has taken on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team is striving for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe to reach the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will get a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesca Millinary, the duo led the fight with two wins over Tiger Woods to bring the results at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Byrne, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, prevailed in the American agency of discontent in the morning, receiving the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in a four-ball game, winning two games, but they couldn't do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Fury's side need eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and the Millennials, who were named Molliwood after sensational outings, are just the second pair to win four points in their first four games in the history of the Ry.
Beating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were wonderfully set to beat down Woods and U.S. qualifier Bryan DeCambo still 5 and 4.
Woods, who played himself after two games on Saturday, showed a chance burst of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four-ball and four-match and seven-match matches.
Justin Rovez, who has rested in x four-ball matches, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in four-ball matches to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – takes one and the other place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time main winner Jordan Spaite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans by two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and John Pulter of Spain in four-ball matches and later returned to beat Puler and Rory McCulroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned from a four-point deficit that goes alone, although to the side of the owners of Furyko you only need to paint to keep the traffic.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will succeed.
North Korea says 'no way' will be unilaterally disarmed without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations was continuing sanctions that exacerbated mistrust of the United States, and under such conditions the country could not give up nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the annual General Assembly of the world body, Rye Yong Ho said that last year North Korea adopted "significant measures of good will", for example, stopping tests on nuclear and missile sites, dismantling of the nuclear testing zone and promising not to dismantle nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves in the first place.”
Despite the fact that Ri has republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's opposition to the "staged" approach to the nucleation, under which North Korea was rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement did not reflect the
Ri relied on a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump on the first ever summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work on the path to "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
North Korea is seeking to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed a call for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States of America initially insists on ‘denuclearization’ and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even opposes ‘declaring an end to the war,’” Ri says.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an inescapable dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader noted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea, not the United States, were a participant in this issue of denuclearization, it would not be a dank country.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly arguing that targeting the U.S. continent with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President Evil" was named after "Mr. Trump."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there would be much more to be done, and the sanctions should remain in place until the end of the Cold War.
Trump said in a statement that he had no time frame to do so, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are fighting in the United Nations. The Security Council said that it is worth rewarding Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must be actively and necessarily continued until we are certain of a complete, final and genuine dynocracy.”
The Security Council tightened sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to halt the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the Security Council. The General Assembly then stated that in the following months he would again visit Pyongyang to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip has not been a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over several hours of talks ended with a visa statement that he was presenting demands "like the gangsters."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to eliminate the missile installation and nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
Trump said that, according to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he expects are a guarantee of security and an effort to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
The students of Harvard are taking a course on proper rest.
Harvard University's new course this year should teach students more sleep, and aims to combat the culture of learning at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham's Hospital and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning, he started the course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, “Why did they tell me this only now, in the last course of study?”
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught by the student, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement, as well as improve the overall mood.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health care service, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were often sleep-deprived for a while.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet where students click on coffee cups, curtains and books that tell about the impact of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of habit before sleep.
At the last stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, invites participants to think about their day-to-day lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they need to know this as much as everyone knows about the health consequences of smoking,” added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, the culture of night parties still exists, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which is proving to be an increasing problem.
“Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he said, “even to avoid excess weight, as getting rid of sleep makes the brain constantly hungry.”
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to all assimilators to complete a similar curriculum before entering the university.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students have the opportunity to set a clock to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of "blue light", which radiates from the screens of monitors and LED floodlights, which can cause problems.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga kills Gerard's goal.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when Dolly Mangy's goal convinced Steven Gerard not to get a 1-0 defeat at the Livingston Stadium.
Abrax wants to record his first win on the road to triumph with a 4-1 draw in February at St. Johns, but Gary Holton's team is already carrying a second loss to Gerard as a manager with 18 games to leave on their side of the eight-point draw, trailing Labrod from the left.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not seem to suffer a defeat.
At the same time as the Rangers are relegated to sixth place, "Livingstan" rose to third place, behind are the Hibernians with a difference in the balls.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems after forward Columbus Spence has to deal with a head injury after he has an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, due to which Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Batford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy under 11 number, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was thrilled with how well they were doing at each step of their opponents.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but Libya made more attempts to kill the ball.
They were supposed to kill within two minutes when Mengie first sent the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took this chance.
A successful penalty shot by Jakobs Keegan caught Craig Chalket's eye, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to strike a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game they were more likely to kill than they were to play a good game.
Alfredo Morales was certainly to be fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Steven Lowles collided on the field, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept Colombia's complaint.
Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but former goalkeeper Aybrox Liam Kelly almost conceded the goal to Lasan Kulibali and the effective attack of Ovi Echiaria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute Libya may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to fans a good game.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to break through Jacob's gate.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Deklan Gallagher gave the pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng from being able to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibala's break with Ryan Kent, and it had an effective effect when the attack broke out to Morales, but the impressive Kelly fled and blocked the shot.
But "Livingstan" continued to please the visitors, playing the game that they liked, and Lithgow and Hulket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side could only prevail in the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to confront Jacobs before Littow went to the reserve bench.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton happened once again after being fined when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLIKI... the day of the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Called Crown, which featured the seemingly infamous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that give off radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is this really necessary now?”!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system “see” cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine seems to teach the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
The cells can then “see” the protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and then reintroduce the helper cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful outcomes for patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who has been given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells has seen ovarian cancer disappear for 18 months.
The method involves getting the immune cells into the patient, changing them in the lab so they can “see” the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then being reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight against cancer of the mammary gland, ovaries, lungs and fat cat,” said Professor Berazofsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and “teaching” them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of the MAGA, after his appearance in the SNL.
Which didn't turn out well.
In the studio during Saturday night, Kanye West was outraged after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Pride City" in the evening, when he was wearing the "Make America Great Again" hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times have I talked to white people and they said, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with the lead role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearing of Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words popped into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Roko.
It's not clear if he's trying to escape from the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the scenes.
They were staring at me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat.
They were staring at me.
“And then they say I’m in a flexible place,” he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner newspaper.
West continued: Do you want to see a dead place? “Speaking that he” wearing my Skperman hat, which meant he couldn’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, the hearings were suspended at least twice, and representatives of the SNA were confused by the message from Veraita. “All the studios were silent.”
West was taken over as the replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the TPU's conservative party, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous in spirit Thank you for your support."
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, wrote that West is just who he is, and it's always wonderful.
“But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothing, or by supporting their ‘art’, which I believe encompasses and promotes an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
“Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that his "official name is now Kenny West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed in the footsteps of Jeddah, also known as Puff Jeddah.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called the Snoop Lion and, of course, the music legend who changed his name to the character, and then he and the artist, previously known as the Prince.
Attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was attacked in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balochistan, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the state prosecutor's office.
Keith Harington’s “Game of Thrones” star has embraced idealized brutality.
Keith Harington is known for his sweeping sword and the role of John Again in the series "Games of Thrones" in the medieval HBO series.
But the 31-year-old actor got the stereotype of a macho hero, which means that young boys often feel tougher to respect.
Speaking at the Culture Sunday Times, Keith said he believes “something has happened” and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Cat, who recently married his “Game of Thrones” neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, has admitted that she feels empowered to solve this problem.
“I feel like I’m personally a strong guy, when we were wrong with courage?” he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, from the point of view of the attitude we see now?”
Cat believes that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality due to the very male characters.
He continued: “What lies at the beginning and why is it taught?
Why are they being taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be so confident to be a real person?
I think that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change that?
It's obvious that something is happening to young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that the series would end next summer, and he would step out of the show's battlefield and not make any docudramas or sequels to Game of Thrones.
From November, Kit will begin resurrecting True Western Sam Sheppard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor said that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose the best opportunity to complete the "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who is in love with the character of Keith John Again in this fantasy series, awarded "Amy".
The couple got engaged in June 2018 at the Leslie estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as was the case in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
“However, the number of such people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has decreased to almost zero,” Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still rampant.
Due to conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are spread by insufficient knowledge and sexual contraceptives. . . .
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the plight, danger, and conspiracy theory of her MPs
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied the accusation that her co-worker posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that there are claims to the participants of the upper-right wing and their sites.
“A lie, a lie, and a lot of ugly lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Published information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sense. Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Oryn Hatch, both from Utah.
The information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings by the Senate Commission on Sexual Harassment Charges in relation to Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The incident took place shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the source's IP address was linked to the Waters office and shared information with a Waters team employee," Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team whose data, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Arya Fleischer.
“This refusal is causing anger,” Fleischer wrote.
This shows that she does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of what they didn't do, they shouldn't be caught.
They don't have to be rude.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and gentle.
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh when they were accused of being too distraught during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican Party candidate who is a candidate and takes part in the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
“It’s a resurgence if it turns out to be true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will bear legal responsibility for all their actions that are disruptive and dangerous to any of my team’s employees.”
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes a blow to the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British cast, and this cast seems to have in the comedy and action-franchise of Johnny English, which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the name of Indy.
Can the satire be well expressed in terms of how obviously foolish we look when we talk about new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English was given the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations he did for non-English moviegoers.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his wise-hearted claims to glamour, became a little like Clouseau with the features of Mr. Bean and a little like the guy who introduced a single note to the Fire Choir at the opening ceremony of the Alytus.
Originally, his character was based on Atkinson's journey and international mysteries, who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
Here are a few moments that haven't happened before.
I loved Johnny English, who is approaching a helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades of the rotor are a little tapping on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for theatrical comedy is brightly demonstrated, but the humor feels weak, and so it's strange especially when serious films such as "Agent 007: Mission Impossible" confidently offer comedy as the main part.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but for kids, and even Johnny English's senseless mishaps aren't as inventive as Atkinson's silent films in the person of Bino.
For many years now, there have been serious problems in the United Kingdom.
The cyber-hacker has infiltrated a super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the scene, to the disappointment of an on-call agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and confused figure who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing like it in the script.
Its intelligence consultants report that, since every real spy will be exposed, it will have to enlist some of those who are already retired.
And this means that for Johnny English himself everything is complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several prestigious institutions and gives lessons on how to be an unencumbered operator: some good examples here, as English offers the Academy of Music a lesson in spying.
English returned to Whitehall for an extraordinary briefing and teamed up with his former long-time friend Bo, who is played by Ben Miller again.
At present, Bo has a marriage tied to the commander of the submarine, whose role Vicky Pepperdine played a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting with the beautiful woman Volha Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve the problems with the hackers of the UK: with the notorious Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: to disguise themselves under an officer, to set fire to a French restaurant; to create a pogrom, to fight smugglers on board a luxury yacht of Volta; English makes a pure anarchy, because he is trying to escape.
All the moments are drawn to the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, in which there are quite a lot of children in the TV.
It's pretty good material.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that it is developing a plan to pay Britons for a four-day work week with a payment of as little as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but they are paid for five.
As reported, the party wants the heads of enterprises to pass on to the workers the results of the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an additional day off.
It was clear that employees would enjoy a three-day vacation in the future, but they would still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A planned review of the action will be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen now, but a four-day workweek is an idea that fits the party’s vision and the overall industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve of such an idea, the Green Party promises to spend a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's efforts in general are not supported.
A representative of the Labour Party said: A four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to voice his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from “unhappy directors” and “managers” to municipal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also provide that the current water resources shareholder may not get back the entire share package, as the Labor government can make a "countdown" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to add workers to the boards of companies and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told “60 Minutes” that FBI investigators working with Kavanaugh must change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh was postponed to a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises as to whether the findings of the Bureau of Republican Senators will be able to provide support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pally asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about "Sense": Can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change?
Kennedy appeared to be more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said, going to the court hearing: I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked about the reason for the accusation, asking, “Did you do this?”
“He was a great and wonderful man.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Brett Kavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denies it,” Graham added, referring to Kristina Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls couldn’t believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is being done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is held the International Festival: an annual musical event that has a very impressive lineup of performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on the 20th anniversary of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, and learn about the real world.
The International Festival of Citizenship, which emerged in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against the Threshold of an International Propaganda Group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), the visitor had to perform a number of tasks or "take action", be a volunteer, write by e-mail to the leader of the country, call any other person and ask for help.
But how successful has the Civil Festival been for 12 years and has it been able to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a priceless concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” – do people feel that they are doing a good job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival have stated that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their fans, who are trying to achieve various goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet more than $37 billion in commitments, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 comments on commitments and made statements in the amount of at least $10 billion that had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's estimates, the funds provided have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with investors and performers based in the UK, “helping children develop in full”, a pledge to provide Rwanda with more than $35 million in grants, and a pledge to provide Rwanda with more than $35 million in grants.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of maltreatment in history,” said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out, which called in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a "food aid" project that reaches 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, “What makes you think we can end poverty?”
The Global Festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will suffer defeat and mistakes.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are one of a number of characters who perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Fernesse and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the U.S. Navy to block Russian oil and gas exports
“Washington may, if necessary, turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from leaving the EU and Middle East markets,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink said in a statement.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are a basis for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to buy energy in the same way as in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of the seabed, and if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy certainly does not get to the market," he said.
Zinke appealed to the participants of the event, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less balancing and replacing fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “one-sided country” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration workers, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to move out of the “wrong” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is being created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's hard-line opposition to the project has its roots in the economy and is an example of fierce competition.
“I believe that we have a single view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which again confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry-representing organization, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Utzam.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion about her participation in the 2020 presidential election, according to a senator from the state of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the Hallioca City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
“The time has come for women to head to Washington to take over our dysfunctional government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take the opportunity to run for president very seriously.”
During a speech at the mayor’s office, Warren addressed President Donald Trump, saying that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, before the vote you need the FBI to conduct an investigation."
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Studies at the University of Safalka/Bostan Globe, fifty-eight percent of "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run for office.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed greater support from former Governor Daval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favor and 48 per cent against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats discussed in connection with the potential 2020 ballot include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also a member of the House of Representatives.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially take a decision by January.
At a rally in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Palin
26-year-old Trak Palin spent a year in Iraq after being called to duty in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence, according to a police report.
“What my son is going through after his return, I can compare it to the results of post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries our soldiers are returning with, in other families,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a "point question" and said that her son, along with other veterans of the war, "come back a little more, hardened, come back with the question of whether there is that respect for which soldiers, pilots, other soldiers fought for, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, an obstruction of an attempt to report domestic violence, the possession of a weapon in a drunken state, according to Dan Panetta's information.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on the provision of ports
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a challenge to the new U.S. policy, which denies shelter to victims of gang oppression or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support the dispute over the policy of providing the port, NBC News reported.
The full name of the case in Grace v. Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union v. Federal Policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his friends with a hard-core gang” had been raped, but U.S. authorities refused to dock her on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries with the highest number of requests for U.S. ports of call, as having serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. docking policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to apply for the docking.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Raisin said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislative experience for states, the country and the world.”
“Federal law requires that applications for a berth be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” the analytical note says.
The lawyers also said in a note that a policy that denies immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“Residence is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views,” Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
The port has never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people face all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue work in Pal. During the attempt to find those who survived, doubled the number of dead
Those who have survived are in a very difficult situation.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Rysa Kusum, calming her young son with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute a car “fast” brings the bodies.
There is very little clean water.”
Residents began to return to their ruined houses, disassembling wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Army's Paula Hospital, where patients are being treated on the street due to repeated push-ups.
Tears appeared in his eyes when he recalled the feeling of strong underground push-ups in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“I didn’t have time to save myself.
I was squeezed under the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “threats” with the use of “propaganda advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the ad.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily’s paid add-on in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress’ election on Nov. 6.
Trump's accusation that China had failed to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said in a conversation with Reuters was a new phase in Washington's crackdown on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for promoting trade, now Beijing and Washington have launched a trade war, the result of which has been a mutual imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts have said, have been introduced to hurt exporters such as Iowa entrepreneurs who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now doubles its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the good American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press to print paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
“And if you look at the newspaper kiosks in Beijing, then there you will find not so many voices against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press knows.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused to offer" to print his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women's suffrage ahead of the midterm elections from Fiasco Cavano, warn analysts
While many well-known Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will receive a blow in response, especially from women, during future midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans already show that they are ready to vote.
“These things can’t be brought back,” said Grant Ryhar, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that was printed Saturday.
Riker said he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women aren’t going to forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow and in November,” Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the MoveOn progressive group, told the Washington-based newspaper Akron.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate Hall when Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to push out Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite a statement by Dr. Christina Blaise-Ford.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be tremendous,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’re already tall, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don’t like the president, but often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court candidate, analysts believe that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there could be a strong blow to the response.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a bit of a mix-up,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about a committee vote or a final vote, or about whether or not to get Kavano in office. It’s about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” noted news channel Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA, a group that
However, it seems that the Americans divided on the issue of the right Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably or not very confidently trust Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they probably or not very confidently trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a push by Flake, the FBI investigates allegations by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an affidavit before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, when drunk, was pursuing her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitalia at a party when they were studying in Eile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world network plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global network, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows the user to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that by creating Inrupt, he meant "ruling over the world."
“We need to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their “own data storage on the Internet” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, case lists, calendars, fanatics, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available at once on the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this “personal enhancement of potential with the help of data.”
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers working on a contract project, and coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make full changes if all of their business models were immediately reviewed.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in promoting net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new era of networking,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: the honour of a priest awarded by the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England, awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a participant in the battles, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel-Governor Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Belengliz and Leacourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never found out that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, in the city of Rashden, Narthamptonshire, two of his grandsons at the parade opened a memorial stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Wang led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through the thick mist and under the heavy gun and machine-gun fire of the enemy."
He then ran to the line of fire and “with great courage” led the soldier forward, capturing the gun himself and knocking out three divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little over a month later the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do and also something worthy of respect.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also put on a wreath after the parade, which was presided over by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor for him to be in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
MMA fans waited all night to see the Bellator 206, they instead got Pep's guinea pig
Just imagine you've been lagging all night to watch a packed broadcast of the Bellator 206 and then you're denied a preview of the main event.
The program with San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on the British Channel 5.
And on the sixth morning, when Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the fight, watching in the UK was just chilling when the program changed to Pepa's pig.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter called switching to a children's cartoon a "someone's stupid joke".
Responding to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said: “According to the state ordinance at 6 a.m., this content was inappropriate and had to be switched to a children’s program.”
"Yes, "Pepper Pig."
Bellator company president Scott Cocker said that in the future they will work on the program to take into account British viewers.
“I think we’re going to discuss the possibility of a repeat, I think we can solve this issue,” Cocker said.
“But now it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we won’t be able to solve it until Sunday on our own time, and it’s Monday on their time.
But we are doing everything possible.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical error.
But that was a state decision.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but overworked.
This is a terrible situation.”
"Discs of an Inhuman Island": Tom Daley felt "insignificant" because of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley said he grew up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality – but this gave him motivation on the road to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Discless Island" program at the leading Lauren Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional leader of this rather old program, Kirsty Young, took a break for a few months due to the disease.
As a man who found himself on a deserted island on the first program of Laverne, Daley said that as a child he felt “smaller” than everyone else, because “society didn’t accept those who liked both boys and girls.”
He said: “I still believe that this feeling that you are not like everyone else and that you are insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so that he would not disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist of the Olympics has become a significant activist of the LGBT movement and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man — the American screenwriter, director, and producer Dustin Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 — “it was unexpected to me.”
Daley married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference didn't matter.
“If you go through this at such a young age” – at the first Olympics he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer – he said that it was difficult to find an equine who would experience such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name is Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "perspectives have completely changed."
“If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medalist.”
His son is also named as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether or not they bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to sit in the first row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew it was what I had been dreaming of all my life – jumping in the water in front of my teammates at the Olympics, that’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the choice of the song – Proud by Heather Small – which found in it feedback in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are still running.
"Discs of an Inhuman Island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m.
Mikelson, who is out of form, remains on the reserve bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to get his form back so that the event doesn't become unlucky.
Mikelson, who will play in this competition, which is held once in two years, a record 12 times, team captain Jim Furrick has placed on the bench spare for Saturday's football.
Instead of being at the center of the events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time Cup winner divided his days between the leader's job and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the peak of his career he was not the best player, but now the 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for the difficult field of Le Golf National, where he is severely punished by inaccurate strikes.
And if the field itself isn't dark enough, Mikkelson will compete in the ninth match on Sunday against the exact British Open champion Francesca Malinara, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are behind on four points at the beginning of 12 singles matches, start with success, the match of Michelson can be extremely important.
F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer expressed confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything more.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, cheered and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He is very confident in himself.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot to the teams last week and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two games.
I wanted to do more, but that's how I thought we were going to play.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else.”
Mikelson will beat Nick Faldo's record by the number of games in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It may be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
Michelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence brought the team a benefit.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to joke about people, and he’s just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see that.
He gives the team a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Byrne knows that a big gap could soon disappear.
Thomas Byrne, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap in front of the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderama, where the European team led by Sev Balester<0xC3><0xA5>s had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that in Valderama we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn after watching as the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and on Friday, and yesterday, at Le National, and 6 a.m.
“History shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end yet.
Tomorrow we're going to play 100.
Go out into the field and do it right.
As long as the points are in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal and that is – an attempt to win this trophy, that is what we will focus on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players from our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side are the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the way his players played on a difficult golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a different game.
There will be a game tomorrow, and that's different.
It's just great if you're on the field with your partner and everything's going well, but if you're playing alone, then this is where your true golfing talents come in.
Here's what you need to tell the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we have to leave the partner, the pits have to go and also show all the best as an individual player."
Unlike Byrne, his rival Jim Furrick hopes for a better individual game for his athletes than the one they've shown in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Miracle in Medina."
“I remember every word of it,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Cranshaw, the 1999 captain, set his players to the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start, which you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
If the speed increases, then the greatest pressure is on those who play games in the middle.
We made the right schedule and put the players the way we liked. You know, tomorrow we’re going to try to get some magic.”
Thomas has been tasked with starting the game and is pitting against Rory McCulroy in the main game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter will play against the top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think that’s how I’m going to close everything,” Bjorn said of his choice for individual matches.
The launch of the new German warship has been postponed again.
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media reports.
The descent of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit wrote, citing a military representative.
The ship was due to enter service in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered as early as 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with strong guns, a variety of anti-carrying and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between tech services – more new frigates may not enter their parties until the age of two.
However, the constant postponements mean that modern warships – which can allow Germany to demonstrate its strength outside the country – will become obsolete until they finally enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have written about many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships only had 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project – including training the crew – also becomes a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – although initially it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems accumulating with the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in the German parliament, said that the Navy “has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions.”
He said that the problem is increasing with time, because the old ships are sinking, and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments has listened to the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being conducted in the Scottish Highlands, is aimed at identifying how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and to help in the future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scientists from the National Society for the Protection of Scottish Monuments deals with small bats and also the brown long-tailed bats of Dabanton in the gardens of Inverness in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in the main places of this locality to monitor the actions of bats during the season.
The company's employees and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all records will determine the frequency of calls of bats, as well as what bats do.
The habitat map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, an adviser to the National Society for Conservation of Nature, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to support forests for bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development work that affects the place of residence and destroys them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
They say they're not blind at all.
However, due to their night life, bats' ears are more sensitive than their eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use complex echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles on the way to flight.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, check-in of places of residence and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organisation even created the first and only Scottish batsman at the Trivet Manor in Dumfries and Galway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
The head of the estate David Thompson says that this is the perfect territory for bats.
“Here, in Triv, we just have a great place for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, so our work here and at other sites will help us understand more about what they need for a better life.”
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out property repairs, as it is possible to inadvertently destroy one seat, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are said to be under guard and are prohibited from killing, scaring, disturbing or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Farrell, an employee of the Organisation for the Protection of Bats in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says: “We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and many of the species we don’t even know how their populations live.”
Ronaldo has been charged with rape, and his lawyers are about to go to court for a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the accusations of raping him “fake news”, saying that people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has published these accusations.
The forward of the Portugal national team and Juventus was charged with raping American Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 for the silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In the Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed 142 million of his followers a few hours after the accusations were published, calling the message "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s messages are fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball owner told the camera.
“They want to advertise on my behalf.
That's okay.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and good person,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case against Der Spiegel magazine on charges it called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case," Reuters reported.
Christian Shertz's lawyer said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that is commensurate with the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
It was as if the incident took place in June 2009 in the luxury room of the Palms Hovtel & Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga seemed to return to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as written in the documents of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after that, Ronaldo kneeled and said that on "99 percent" he is "a good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that they had sex, but according to the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she now wants to re-accuse because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
At a time when it was as if this case had taken place, Ronaldo was going to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing the 100-million-euro deal.
Brexit: UK 'will always regret' the loss of automakers in the UK
The UK will “always regret” losing its status as the world’s leader in automotive after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "disturbed" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cut production at a plant in Bernastone, near Derby in half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay on the border as a result of Brexit without an agreement could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The plant in Bernastone – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – last year produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“In my view, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will take place if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. Among them Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that automakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just-in-time" basis when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be disruptions at the border that will lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota will not be able to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the plant in Derby, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "Chekers Plan" on future relations with the EU was "made precisely to avoid these border checks".
“We need a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow not only today’s success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, shows that we should be able to continue the work of successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will not work, but in the future warned that the added cost will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tuvalaris, who has been working in Bernastone for 24 years and is the union’s coordinator, said the union members are very concerned: “In my opinion, if jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
The government’s press secretary said: “We have offered a precise plan of our future relationship with the EU, which deserves confidence.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week," while a fight around the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who explores Russian interference in the election, Trump's aides' ties to Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
To fire Trump's assistant attorney general or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been pouring oil into the fire of Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein has done it.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumours that he was going to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump would take place on Thursday, which was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Forrestina, were speaking.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's statement against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set, maybe this week, maybe next week. I believe that, rather, a week later, taking into account all the other things that have taken place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information.”
Some journalists are willing to challenge her assertion: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the head of the program, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the briefings was caused by a disregard for teleporters who “work in public,” though she added: “I agree with the fact that they work in public.”
Then she said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
“The president has more meetings with answers to questions from the press than any president who’s been to him,” she said, adding without specific facts: “We’ve studied these numbers.”
The briefings are happening, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s far better than doing it through me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen how we’ve done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings where you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions about whether he is leaving the White House or taking part in meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The president's own press conference is rarely held.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagant, he appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health care system ahead of Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them well after Brexit.
Mr Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of residence applications from EU citizens working in the country's public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the departure of our country continued. They lead to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also rushed to prepare for the no-deal scenario.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and beyond, give valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie suffered an emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in a Sunday game that his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, according to Mike Organ of the Tennesseean.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury the player had received shortly before the break.
“He went to the sideline and suddenly he fell,” Reid said.
Trainers and doctors continued to deliver Abercombi's oxygen to the field before putting it to the test and transferring it to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was no “more information about what kind of injury it was,” and Tennessee State are trying to identify when the player received the injury.
Abercombi, a second-year sportsman, spends the first season behind Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full interceptions, giving just 18 interceptions per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher tax rate.
According to the new plan of the Conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action neutralizes the success of Corbin's initiative to attract young voters.
An increase in the state tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in homeless aid.
Today, Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government fee, and the extra money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters, as well as give affordable housing. It is aimed at high-income people.
The increase in state fees is aimed at individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing program for the homeless.
The increase in the current state duty, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, on the purchase of second homes and rental housing, can amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents of the UK, this leads to higher prices and new buyers are finding it difficult to buy their first home.
Many of the country’s rich regions – especially the capital – have become “ghost cities” because a large number of overseas buyers do not live in the UK most of the time.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Boris Johnson's call to reduce the government's fee for young buyers to facilitate the purchase of the first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high prices on real estate by seizing the land and not using it, and called on Ms. May to cancel the quotas on affordable housing to fix the “shameful situation with housing” in Br.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including rent control and a halt to the "groundless" eviction.
He also wants to give the local council more powers in the field of housing construction.
Ms May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my work as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – life for every new generation should be made better.
This means that we are improving the quality of our home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair that people who do not live in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as UK workers do.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My main ambition is to run the Scottish national team’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his main ambition is to one day become the coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old is tasked with restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place in the First League, three points from the first.
He moved on to this job in the summer after returning St. Mary's to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn’t work,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“I grew up with a lot of problems for Scotland at the Hempden Stadium with my father, and something always forced me to come back.
But that’s the only way I’ll be able to be a successful coach.”
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach are Dick Advocat, David Moise, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye, and Paul dee Cagney.
Former coach of Aloa Atletik says he did not feel afraid of such well-known names in such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success now will be the answer to the question, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League,” he said.
“Not only will I bring him back, but I will only consider my work to be successful if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa come back from the third league and turned Saint-Mir<0xC3><0xA8>ne into a loser who almost made it to the Champions League to win the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling Aloa’s work, he said, “It was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing because I've worked well, made good money and reached certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, and for me it’s the best time of my adult life.”
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Saturday, September 30 on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 UK daylight saving time.
According to the study, the ideal time to drink pint beer – 17:30 on Saturday
The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling for survival, but has brought pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the statistics of the group of pubs and bars, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the volume of sales decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting business group CGA, which collected these statistics, said: "The weather continued to be sunny and longer than expected, the participation of the English national team in the final of the World Cup, means that in July, there was more than a week ago.
The drop in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks have so far shown the best result as opposed to restaurants.
The pubs that sell more food also get soaked in the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages grew by 6.6 percent, and food sales declined by three percent.”
Paul Neumann, RSM’s analyst on rest and placement, said: “These results are a trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, as sales have fallen by 4.8 percent per year, and it's very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for food-focused operators, and the weather will show whether lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the development of brands.
The sales tracking tool in UK pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups that have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an important benchmark in this industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Research has shown that one in five children – some only 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being posted there.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children – some only 11 – create social media accounts that keep secrets from their parents.
The study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept “clean” “core” accounts to show their parents, and they also kept private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site, learned that she had called on others to “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent school principals (HMC) found that 40 percent of teens aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create places on the internet where neither parents nor teachers will find them.”
Eileen Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ in Scotland’s Athletics Council
Eileen Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an observer member of the council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most-titled track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her experience at a variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
“Eilid enjoys a great deal of respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the world,” Beatty said.
Doyle said, “I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can help manage the sport in Scotland.”
An American who won gold in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at the other Olympics, and who now works as a BBC expert, cannot walk after experiencing a micro-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'll be able to fix it and to what extent.
It was a tough job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm practicing in the gym!
Thank you for your message of support!”
An advertisement for a milk pump, where mothers compare with cows, shared opinions on the Internet
The dairy pump manufacturing company shared the views, releasing an ad that compares nursing women to cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of what is called the world’s first breast pump, Elvie’s consumer company has released an Iranian music ad based on a video to show the freedom this device gives a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-chest dance under the song, where there are such words: “Yes, I give myself, but I don’t have a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s not a wash, it’s my chest.”
And he sang: “Come, come, I will feed the children, come, come, I will give my women.”
However, the ad, which was placed on the company's Facebook page, caused a heated discussion on the Internet.
77 000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said that it is a horror of dairy production.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but only their children are taken away in a few days,” wrote one viewer.
Elvie's tiny pump unobtrusively hides in bras for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Of course traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for a mother who doesn’t have children?”
Someone added: “Such an ill-advised advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song "fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I had breast milk.
The fact that I'm pregnant makes me feel like I'm pregnant.
It's a little crazy, but I liked it.
“It’s a great product,” she wrote.
Another comment: “A very entertaining advertisement directed at the mother, who suck milk pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and hear themselves “cars”.
This advertisement does not excite and does not condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires, no tubes and is discreetly hidden in the bra for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep their children and even leave the house during the operation of the device.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the absorption of milk and its severity, while demonstrating in a fun and merry way how the new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elsie's breast pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium in the clothes of Marta Yakubovsky, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without noise are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of border crossings per month has hardly changed, the number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, in part due to the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration that have hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors are illegal immigrants who are wary of jeopardizing their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other adult members of the household would need to be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, appeared before Congress with a report on the arrests by the agency of dozens of people who have asked for the suspension of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had previously had no convictions.
“About 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or members of their household are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
So we continue to persecute such people,” said Mr. Albens.
To speed up the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, previously a standard period of 60 days.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status to an immigration judge will have to use a video link, rather than be present in court in person.
Those who are not considered to have any reason to give help are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system, which have appeared in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of depression or an increase in anxiety, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted suicide.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are much stronger, since the signs that the child is in a hot state are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that the move of children to a tent town without providing time for emotional preparation or for pampering with friends can worsen the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of the “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's eight-year-old war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "they will be treated accordingly."
“They should leave immediately and without putting any conditions,” he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
Mualeem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions of people have had to leave their homes since 2011, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus intends to continue "to carry out this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
About 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mostly acting as instructors and advisers to the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land contingent in this war-torn country is made up of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for return are favorable and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that hold refugees abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their return,” he says.
“They are politicizing the humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be given any help in reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, against the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "exact deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would be directed against the jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, who "will be annihilated".
UN Ambassador Stafan de Mistura hopes in the near future to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a successor constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem expressed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and caution against interference.
Why Trump is going to the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberals hope, the impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency.
And it will, without a doubt, be “The most dramatic end of the presidency in all of history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled — to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled — to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the broadcast of "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC gathered 3.5 million viewers on the screen and exceeded the ratings of the cable.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Bear, director of ABC’s drama “The Legacy,” about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scowell, a masterful comedic screenwriter and author of “A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Penetrating a Club of Hollywood Boys,” there’s another theory.
She is referring to a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The governor told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He replied, “Because he amuses me,” Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is also valuable to those who can enjoy it.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the storylines that come out of Washington can be just as defining for the future as the War Against Wade case, depending on whether the families of immigrants will be able to come together and unite.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you look at the sixth hour, how a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodward's "information is not for print" in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 with a thick leather (clothes sewn with pride), as in,
I don't think I'll ever look at Super Mario like I did before.
“A lot of what he does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show that he shows every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changes.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll be out of the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleisch this week, behind the windows of his house on the north coast of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
It could not have happened, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on his hair.
“I remember the kids when we were doing these crazy shows, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flees told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows are pouring into a tough pre-election race in the mid-term elections in the House of Representatives
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district was covered by a cash bailout due to a change in the boundaries of counties introduced by Congress, which is why two candidates participate in elections for one seat.
The recently repainted suburban district of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in last spring's by-election.
Lambo is opposed by another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the company's funding by major party financial groups, the Democratic Company Congress Committee (DPCC) and the Republican Company National Committee (RCRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely publicized midterm elections in Pennsylvania's 18th district in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts say there is a slight preference for the Democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing El Salvador for China's support, and then withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Mr. Trump's leadership team.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to recall the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan," said the press secretary of the State Department.
However, the sanctions were only considered in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would be painful for a Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and killings.
At the end of the internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of the similar meeting last year, as was the case in the previous year.
But by mid-September, high-ranking administration officials had further understood that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively stopped consideration of the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in sign of the administration's support for the event.
Three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further harsh messages or punishments from Washington, D.C.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by others, close to the administration analyst, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the history
The next step could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about examples of which there is currently very heavy evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of collusion between the Trump company and Russia in the attack on the election.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will find himself in the face of responsibility to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately, to the jury of his colleagues.
There’s a lot of “when” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, just like it is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that will determine how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next few years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy is hastened or postponed.
The U.S. is currently facing some of these challenges.
What will happen if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a difficult situation since it was reported in the newspaper that last year he offered to secretly write down the president's words and considered his incompetence.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into the Brett Kavanaugh case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court, despite a credible charge of sexual assault and indiscriminate incarceration?
And first of all, are we going to vote in an election for Congress that will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my country's embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later she sent me to light the Candlesticks on this table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Grem Dorans from Rangers are optimistic about the pre-match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapids on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians after a spectacular draw in Spain over the Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to confidently exit the Europa League Group G.
The knee injury prevented half-back Graham Dorans from performing for the first time in the season before a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a springboard.
“It was an important match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we earned a point.
Maybe we could kill the ball in the end, but in general, nothing has also been a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday there will be another important night for European football.
I hope we can earn three points, but it will be a difficult game as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans at the stands, I am sure we will be able to beat them and show a good game.
The past year has been hard, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and the guys really enjoy the game; the trainings are productive.
I hope we can move forward, surpass last season’s result and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants of the survey had a clear idea of what they want for themselves, few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide survey reported that they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's what we should start with.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not announce your wishes in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get involved in the discussion of a financial advisor. it can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or you can insure your life on your own – provided you have the money.
Dealing with the legal documents: foretell the court battles.
Get the trust of the medical service to appoint a trusted person to control your medical service and to ensure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in the event that you are unable to speak.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing a trust in the management of finances.
Assign a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure the payment of your bills when you are incapacitated.
Do not forget about the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the use of anti-allergy drugs?
Write down these details in writing so that you're ready.
“Not only financial issues but also the professionalism of doctors play a role,” adds Martin.
“What kind of medicine is needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything.”
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic screw
The man received several blows from a pneumatic screwdriver when he was walking home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m. local time, as an “accidental incident.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to his life, the police ask the witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in india
According to officials, at least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala regency, a district north of Pale that is closer to the earthquake's 7.5-point epicenter.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the wake of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Dongala is a regency that extends along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency – the administrative unit with the status below the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongla.
The extraction of nickel is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongal have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami in Dongla, hundreds of houses were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly rocked by earthquakes.
Below is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that toppled over 14 countries, resulting in more than 226,000 deaths along the entire coast of the Indian Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the regency of Piji Jaya in Aceh province, causing devastation and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence in the family
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted reports of domestic violence and opposition to the arrest, published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU channel, Palin is in the Matanuska-Susitna insulator under a $500 facility.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "precisely innocent" when asked if he would plead guilty, the network said.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which he faces up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time the charges have been filed against Pauline.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to tell them about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 for her son's hard-line behavior with post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are a lot of videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the beach.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office has issued a rare death warrant for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Syful Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly took advantage of a rented Home Depot truck in October to ride a bike path along the West Side chassis in Lower Manhattan, knocking pedestrians and cyclists down on his way.
To justify the death sentence, according to a statement of intent to achieve the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" shot eight people and "intentionally" shot them.
According to the court's materials, for both offenses, a possible measure of punishment in the form of a death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigative jury acquitted Saipov of premeditating the charges of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racket; this count is usually used by federal prosecutors in the prosecution's cases.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "ancient and deliberate planning", and in describing the crimes committed by Saipov, they used phrases such as "disgusting, harsh and scattered".
"Sifula Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, harmed and caused losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ana-Lora Dekadt, Darena Drake, Ariel Erlia, Erna Feruth.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last time a criminal case was opened, with a death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khaled Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York on a federal case was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were punished after they had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy to spy for the benefit of the Soviet Union.
A pair of Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek expatriate, according to court documents, demonstrated the absence of convictions in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said that he was pleased with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that the attack inspired him to watch a video of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also asked for permission to display the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital palace, police said.
He does not plead guilty to a charge of 22 counts of perjury.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “unquestionably disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” Patan said.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of parliament from the Torah says Nigel Farage should lead talks on Brexit.
Today, during a protest at a Tory party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel discomfort” from eurosceptics – as one of the members of parliament Theresa May offered her candidacy for talks with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen said during a march in Birmingham that Britain would have "come out" if Mr Farage had held the post of secretary of state for Brexit.
But the problem that Mrs. May faced while trying to reconcile her scattered supporters has worsened as the Tories, who are in favour of maintaining EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Compromised Chess Agreement under constant pressure from the supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as from the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to strike a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the “disaster”.
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salihall, “Leave Means Leave,” that he wanted to “take Chucker off the board.”
He suggested that Mr Faraday be made equal and that he be given the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have already come out,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellington added: “I am in favour of Brexit, but we need to move away from the Chequers plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is completely out of the question.”
Brexiteer and Torah member Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and speaking to reporters, she said: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Cheker plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually going out and electing us.
Please turn away from the plan and start listening.”
In a brief address to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain in office when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage said politicians need to be made to feel "discomfort" if they are going to back down on the 2016 referendum decision.
“It’s a question of trust between us, the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘It’s not going to get out of your hands.’”
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are ready to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham before spending a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis was teasing the Conservatives about the security problems they faced because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can have ready-to-use IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for a border free of friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of balloting for the post of president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that following the November election, she will “pay close attention to the process of running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from the state of Massachusetts spoke about his future at a general meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go to re-election, opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Dhill, who was a co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival of Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it has been the 36th meeting of voters in the format of the general assembly, which took place on Saturday in Khaliyok.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president of the United States.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair a broken government, and for this a woman must be at the head.”
The arrest took place after the death of basketball player Sims from the team of the University of Louisiana
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditano Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who appeared on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death,” Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed that he was at the scene of the crime, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not object to the arrest and was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A junior sportsman growing 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, 10 of which were on the pitch from the beginning, averaged on the pitch 17.4 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after winning the victory over Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Fethel on an intra-community basis
From the moment Walter Bottas advanced to Lewis Hamilton's qualifying session on Saturday, it became clear that the orders within the Mercedes team played a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good spot on the pole and almost left Hamilton at the mercy of fate until he defended his spot on the first two laps and invited Fethel to attack his friend on the team.
Fethel was the first to go to the pit stop and let Hamilton drift at the end of the overall mass of the riders, it was this maneuver that was supposed to be decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to a pit stop on the lap later and came out behind Fethel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a few lap-to-wheel maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior space free, scurrying in.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and by the end of the first round was in seventh place.
He then led most of the race while holding the tyres, as he wanted to finish quickly, overtake Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went to the pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight laps, so Raikanen took fourth place.
"It's been a tough day because Walter's all weekend performances are fantastic and he's proven to be a real gentleman if I'm allowed to say that.
“The team did an outstanding job of taking first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted it was not the source of Christine Blaise Ford's escape letter, in which she accused a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bree Coot.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate has shown how people can be “ugly, abominable and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see evil, ugly and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Wait a minute.
We allowed the escape... No, we didn’t,” he added, referring to the senator.
Finstein sent a letter in July detailing Ford’s charges against Kavanaugh, and he fled in early September – but Finstein denied that the escape took place from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t let her story slip,” Finstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential, and I granted her request.”
But her denial probably did not please the president, who so commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “That’s what I’ll tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing the defense of a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president has speculated that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You see the subjugation, the abomination, and they do not care who they hurt, through whom they will have to transgress in order to gain power and control,” – says the president of “Mediaite”.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Denmark.
The Dandy Stars played for the Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League on Friday's defeat, winning the back-to-back 5-3 home game on Saturday.
Thanks to the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bauville, the Giants led on two goals in the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the number before Duaier regained the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard of Dundee equalized the number, after which Lucas Lundwald Nielsen scored two goals to secure the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League for the Adam Keef team, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season; in the previous three matches, the Giants won.
The first goal in the fourth minute of the match (03:35) was scored by Dwyer from the pass of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later, Bavilie doubled the number after the pass of David Rutherford.
In the animated first period (13:10) Sullivan discovered the number from the field's hosts, and then Cohen equalized the number after passing Matt Markwardt (15:16).
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead on the first break, killing his second washer for the meeting at the end of the first period.
Taking the side regrouped, and Bushar again equalized the score, killing the washer at the team's count (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Karkoran helped Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time for the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win along with the team's fifth number in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, play their last home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller is killed, saving hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia died heroically, ensuring the successful take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared without a trace following a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong underground attacks are still ongoing, and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were on the run, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower, which wildly swung in the airport of Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
It remained in place until the Batik Air company's 6321 flight, which was at the time on the runway, was lifted off the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided that it was going to be destroyed.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program “ABC News”, according to the representative of “Air Navigation Indonesia” Johannes Siraite, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter made its way to Paul.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities are concerned that the number of victims could reach several thousand, and the agency for reducing the risk of natural disasters claims that access to the cities of Dongla, Siga and Button is limited.
A spokesman for Sutop Purva Nugroh said: “Perhaps the number of victims will continue to increase, as many bodies have still not been able to recover from the rubble.”
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palo, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Rysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a car “fast” brings bodies.
There is no clean water.
There are shops all over the place.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don’t know what awaits them here.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Jok Vidoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he asked, “CNN.”
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: according to the "Air Niugini" one person disappeared without a trace after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the team happily evacuated from the plane, which sank, and now announces the disappearance without a trace.
The company "Air Niugini" said in a press release that as of Saturday, it can not give a report on the location of one passenger-male.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after landing the plane on the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuvk.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday; all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events remain unsolved.
According to statements from both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing strip.
According to some witnesses, the plane has passed through the landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane was flying very low.
“It’s very successful,” Janes said.
According to him, he and others were able to get through the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which had already sunk.
He said the flight attendants panicked and began to scream, as well as that he had received a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that the sailors who moored near the docks also helped in the rescue, using a boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in the crash of planes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst restores the course of events on the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the submission of evidence in the review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been demonstrating for several hours as an engaged expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records from mobile phones to learn about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlet, he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Telis had been with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statement.
If the data that his mobile phone was next to Chambers's phone at a time when, according to him, he was confirmed along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to ask Sanford.
Sanford gave evidence on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he said that he was “lying because my van was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was Tellis' assertion that he had been acquainted with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The records from the mobile phones showed that they knew each other for only a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after her death, Chambers Telis removed her messages, calls, and contacts from her phone.
“He pulled her out of his life,” Haley said.
The two sides are expected to start talks on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to challenge the negative view of this genre, filling their music with positive installations.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says hip-hop has moved away from its origins: political statements and passionate questions.
They want to get back to its roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey have returned to such a collection as The Fugees and Common, a popularity in the UK.
There's another black hole?!
A New York woman has filed a lawsuit against a married couple for a "Russian" message after being released.
A New York-based nanny is suing a married couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a accidentally sent message from her mother complaining that she is “another brunette.”
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the claim to "competitiveness."
In 2016, Linsey Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day at work.
“NEW YAHUVEH, THERE IS ONE BLACK SQUARE,” Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent a message to Mrs. Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing the mistake, Plaska-Flaxman “felt incapacity” fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, had mishandled the job and that she was waiting for her in place of her Filipino.
Mrs. Morris paid for the day's work and sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is a couple in court and wants to get compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months of living.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” she told the Post on Friday.
The couple denied accusations of racism, arguing that Morris' dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they could not trust her after she was insulted.
“My wife sent me something I shouldn’t have said.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” said Joel Plaska, husband of Post.
“Would you trust your children with whom you have dealt rudely, even by accident?
"Your daughter?
Is it?”
Plaska equates the call to “excessiveness” and reports that his wife was born only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It is quite tough,” added the specialist for investment-banking activities.
Although judicial dissension is still ongoing, public opinion quickly condemned the marriage couple on social media, subjecting them to sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Podington were worried that readers would not be able to cope with the bear that is talking, said in a new letter.
Bonda’s daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of the one who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is so interesting to read this, already knowing about the great success of Podingtan."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work was not accepted and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet".
She added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success, referring to Padingtan, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family".
“He was quite a quiet man, and not at all boastful,” she said.
“But since Podingtan was so real to him, it was almost a father’s honor for a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your fault.
I think that's the key to Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave the property to Podingtan himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors fought in vain for her life.
“I called over regularly to tell her that everything was really bad, that she couldn’t stand it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
“Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “Daddy, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave to scare her heart slowly left her body.
She died some time ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was going on there.
I couldn't stand or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – and they did not know what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and cried all the time on my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was in the flight that I caught Ned's feeling of compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are grieving are hanging out cards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
The two women who lost their loved ones, who ended up committing suicide, are doing everything to ensure that other people don't take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help, on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began depression, and at the age of 18 he died of suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I do,” she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says: “I am constantly concerned that this may have unpleasant consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the cards, “so that people know that there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Ms. Hasfris, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the feast day he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them.”
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to live with it: “There was a big hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain, as the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought we could have what he wants — limited in time and scope of the investigation — we could get a little bonding,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “disrupting” because it actually got into a jam.
"Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unhappiness is sometimes explained.
Interim elections in just five weeks, November 6 – if Republicans are expected to suffer a defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the Supreme Court candidate they need.
George W. Bush called a senator to pro-laborate support for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem of equality of votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea has decreased under the leadership of Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Pak Bo-sung, citing data from South Korea's ministry of unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main reasons are the increased border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs imposed by smugglers for re-shipment.
Pyongyang hasn't said anything about it.
Most of the refugees from the north with all the reason why they get the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run through China, with which North Korea has the longest border. It is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily protected.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South – which are technically still in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on common terms to work with the goal of fully releasing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ry Yang Ho accused the U.S. of failing to make progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions, we are not going to disarm first,” Mr. Ry said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and said he shouldn’t work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court at the time.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t get rid of the idea that if a woman behaved like that, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally refuted accusations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when discussing his family and the older classes of the school.
He also explicitly accused Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a "gratuitous and organized assassination of a person," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's speech showed he can't work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed he has bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try Kavanaugh's impeachment if he was elected and if Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then not only does he not have to work in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
At the moment, Kavano is a judge of the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Rowe's case against Wade, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh did not respond to questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, unbiased individuals to work in court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified accusation speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steine told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think it’s that rare.”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, and who said that when she got caught, she would cry, but she worked out the technique of behavior. When she got caught and started to cry, she would say to the interlocutors: “Maybe you think I’m drunk.
But I am angry.”
I just continued the conversation.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as a way out of the sum, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, in which I once cried with unspeakable anger, was caught by an elderly woman – a restrained boss who always scared me a little – and dragged me to the stairs.
“Never let anyone see you in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they pushed you.”
Patricia Shroder, then a congressman Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt found out about a marriage betrayal on a yacht called Monkey Business and left the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Shroder believed that she herself could participate in the presidential campaign.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates, and they didn’t need me at all.
Someone called this situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the company has been going on for quite some time, she didn't have the funds, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m going with a discount?” she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not be involved in the election campaign, she was so caught up in emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to get money and directed at voters, not candidates – and that would lead to over-sex.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Shroder recalled the press’ reaction to her condition.
“You might think that my corporate sponsor is a manufacturer of Kleenex paper napkins.
I was wondering what they were going to write about in my book.
“She was crying?”
Why the U.S.-China trade war could be good for China
The first outbreaks of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and as the war is far from over, in the longer term, misunderstandings between countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs hit goods worth a total of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to ten percent on U.S. goods at a cost of $60 billion.
China has promised a symmetric response to the United States, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to succeed.
To force Washington to back down, it is necessary to delve deeper into the demand, but public bias against the United States is almost unacceptable for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the U.S. trade war in the distant future can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than the observers previously thought," said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher at the Institute for Investigative Research.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and targeted economic measures that were aimed at improving their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the country will not accept aid in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that have sponsored the militants.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National course in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Byrne scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who competed most in the tournament, threw his ball into the water on 3 pairs of the 16th hole, relegating this match to Francesca Malinara.
The Italian golfer Malinari played well on all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this 5-0-0 field since the start of the tournament in a current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with a score of 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thornbjorn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the player with the most wins in a tournament with a career score of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European team’s victory.
He handed the baton to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match.
“I’m very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I’ve been watching since I was a kid,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and lags behind on this indicator only from Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team competed with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finn, who played throughout the tournament in high-class golf.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighters.
This morning, we showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Rider's Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We were overjoyed.”
