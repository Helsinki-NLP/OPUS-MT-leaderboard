The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the retention of the benefit for travel in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure of organizing a preferential trip of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region has changed.
According to the press service of the Government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the benefit for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in trips, as before, and in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in the winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the rest of the funds.
The cost of the discounted journey for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare valid at the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip reimburses the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishment of the social card with funds remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed accounting of the spending of money on the social card with accuracy up to the kopecks.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the money credited, but not spent.
We will also add that the scheme of settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of the trip is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Road Administration and Transport of the Ivanovo region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card more than 470 million rubles.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend.
During a 911 call, college teacher Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb said there was a "spider" in the house who was alive, but was probably upset, and said the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note carelessly written by hand on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like to take it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to officials signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who led two online courses at the University of the Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then managed to travel 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot all respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the sidelines.
The head of police at Delta State University, Lynn Baford, said university officials learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true call to 911 soon after.
By the end of the day, the victims will find one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the staff of the authorities were still trying to put into one picture the motives that prompted Lamb.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped paint a portrait of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
The police in Gothia, where Prentiss died, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his book, in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for the emergence of problems.
One student who spoke well of Lambe, Brandon Bivers, said he also seemed worried and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's admission rules meant that the degree of doctor Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of a teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from the campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb fired a 38-caliber single-shot gun in the back yard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His engine-driven car was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. degree in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Hearston said she was 15 and Lambo was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the girls were melting when he was around,” says Hearston, who is now 40 and lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for quite some time at the time of the events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothia in a brick house, the other side of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is okay.
Former Prentiss husband Sean O'Stin said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's quite depressed," O'Stin said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gothie, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We laughed and laughed at each other.
I mean, they were both very smart.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, led seminars for first-year students and specialized in Native American and Colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas at Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the University of the Delta campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candle-lighting memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is a day of healing.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was redacted in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, as well as in connection with the fact that although Lamb was talking about Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with a retailer of toys and children’s goods saying it will provide staff and temporary staff with the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 that were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviews with applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff in order to have enough staff in stores and for the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "meeting" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future turned out to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in a movie theater waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and here I fell asleep – next to me will be Princess Diana,” he said in the trailer for the soon-to-be-released documentary “Back in Time.”
The movie begins, and here it comes to my mind that I am literally at a distance of an outstretched hand and in one fake rabbit from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back to the Future" - a documentary film about the film "Back to the Future" - includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" was released 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “it’s arguably the greatest movie about time travel that’s ever been made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says no military solution exists in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia’s military support for Syria, said there was “no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and arms growth would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council – the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France – during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation unsolvable."
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in resolving the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Isn't Joking
Some have tried to put the label of the provocateur on him.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But no matter how some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump’s high position in poll results, they haven’t succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in double digits, and some are starting to seriously question what this means for a real estate magnate in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
This is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate himself to the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to the popular German Kane, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s “Supercommittee of Political Action” and the economic conservative “Growth Club” have acknowledged Trump’s unwavering strength and are beginning to deliver their dollars to topple him.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathy for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators are getting higher in the initial stages.
Quinnipiac’s Iowa poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would vote for Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disturbed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next Level of Enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “unsatisfied” or “disturbed” if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed assembly in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he’s not the person who can be effective in office, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters have never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a scattering is likely to play to Trump’s advantage, and at the same time non-Trump supporters are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Caesich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got nothing on Ted Cruz.
Is he the only candidate who gets away with it?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by 19 points in the hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Still, Trump’s most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bias will deter key voters of Latin American descent from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday in a new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a person with government experience.
And they are also offended by Washington.
The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa poll, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “angry.”
The government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Holodec said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulation pension of Russians.
The hunger striker noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
This is about the same as the full pension index for the following year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hunger striker believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are they often irritated and reddened centuries?
Answered by doctor-ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our ages are the screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that sit on it.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the century, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The way out is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wipe for centuries;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the century from the accumulated in them on the day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures are not necessary to supplement and warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salmon, chamomile), liquefying the dense secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelid, which should be carried out by circular movements of the pads of the fingers;
When washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to further thickening of the secretion of sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear warheads have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean officials said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongben nuclear complex, was working "at full capacity."
This report appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
The DPRK is ready to respond at any time to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear weapons test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since.
Pyongyang claims that it succeeded in creating a nuclear warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly conducted tests of medium and short-range missiles, writes Polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during the meeting of the State Duma, reports the “Russian News Service”.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
“A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can’t stand it,” Zhirinovsky said.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the fourths, which contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God, the King of the Guards", and the Russian tricolor replaced with an imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, then they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this problem.
“This is the essence of the refugee issue,” he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
“So we can reach a consensus, but we can’t implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,” Assad said.
About 500,000 migrants arrived in the EU this year, including those from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently tightened border controls to deter them from inflowing.
According to the authorities, about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call the numbers significantly large.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents offer migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at the Prime Minister's Questions Session
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, the Prime Minister is expected to make his debut at the session of questions with great impatience
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will speak to the Prime Minister for the first time at a question-and-answer session, as he faces David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six issues raised in the afternoon; his speech will likely be closely watched by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he could miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as a leader; it will take place after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trad Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent during Tuesday’s performance of the national anthem on duty, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several cutting-edge newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, shadow cabinet member Mr Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbyn's team, expressing disagreements over economics, defence and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “burning up” in the Labour party after Mr Corbyn’s appointment to the European Union and the government’s restriction of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn stated at the Trad Unions conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, said there was “full clarity” in the party that it was only in opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the “courier’s box” in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "attracted collective resources" to get Mr. Cameron's ideas and more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of parliament from the Aylington North district said that the Prime Minister’s questions cause unnecessary confrontation, and that he will refrain from both shrewd answers and the exchange of bribes, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth issues.
Mr. Corbyn stated that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on Prime Minister's issues when he was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak whenever possible, saying that he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Becoming a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of the "fairground stall" often associated with the Prime Minister's question-and-answer procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has turned into a caricature and requires sweeping reforms.
"Photographed in Johannesburg" Homeless young people learned from photographers
The business center of Johannesburg is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former outlaws found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
“I was filmed in Johannesburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of the surrounding area and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound sterling is rising as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of wage growth in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a carry-over to an earlier period of forecasts for possible price increases.
The pound sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller shares stood out, which grew by 20% thanks to the offer to buy, which came from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from a rival group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had managed to raise $2.5 billion by placing shares, as part of a debt-reducing strategy.
The shares of the paper and packaging group Mondi were the leaders of the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after sportswear supplier JD Sports reported an 83 percent profit-to-tax increase in six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries Could Prevent Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Kaugill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increased cost of labor, he says.
The costs could have affected JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches campaign at the initiative of the bottom to combat Aldi’s pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from pressure from Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier launched an initiative at the bottom of the campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming infusion of $700 million by Aldi.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media outlets and at “Show A” events.
The campaign is joined by retailers and IGA suppliers such as the ice cream maker Simmo’s from Dansborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to regular customers for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, a day when this wholesale food, beverage and household goods supplier will hold its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot on the horse, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to adhere to the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Losses in revenue and sales of food at a high level of constant Metcash costs could cost the company about 13 million income before paying interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is despite the fact that a recent Morgan Survey study found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Chief Financial Officer Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to attendees at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash “may very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas's comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash’s board of directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent from 2012 due to operating deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to align retail prices with prices in Coles and Woolworths at thousands of positions per week and helping IGA retailers revamp marketplaces, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that flattening prices and re-equipping retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly hurt in a recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyros and deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Hilly.
Kokkinakis, a junior in the talented duo and often referred to as the "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself in the spotlight due to Kyros' embarrassing altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualifying match at Cincinnati, a judge at the top had to double-cross Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, with Harrison stating, "Wawrinka had to put on Kiryos's shovels, and I had to put on the shovel of this pair."
Since the last time Kokkinakis was seen breaking a rocket after a concussion in his leg saved Richard Gasket from a possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly is devoted to protecting Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-final against the United Kingdom.
“I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that the Thanasis were drawn into the conflict,” he said.
He really broke the racket when he got his foot down at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when hopes were dashed, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of that.
But in fact, he owned himself very well in pretty provocative situations at the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he fits well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensively trained, he is in excellent form, he is a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated for his dignity.
Hili also supported the decision to forgive Chir<0xC3><0xB3>s for an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the game, not the disputes around [Kyrios],” he said.
And I think Nick's got the power very quickly, as proved by people like Federer and Murray, he's growing better in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to get him out of the center in a little while.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Announcing a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those trying to enter the country illegally in order to stem the inflow of migrants.
There were riots at the border – hundreds of migrants piled up on the border territory, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply negatively.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland, smashed tents and settled in the area.
Dissatisfaction, however, increased.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian special-purpose police.
Some protested by refusing to eat or drink.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared the expulsion of migrants from Hungary “unacceptable” as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the accompanying damage.
We need to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to take joint responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) according to which EU member states will accept another 120,000 refugees, including refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to convene an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect urgent action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The declared state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on a stretch of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were connected to the urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “narrow spot” and border crossing point of the European Union for displaced people, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants looking for a more prosperous life, not refugees – victims of hostilities that have the right to protection, and this view sharply contradicts the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for people accused of trafficking.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zolt<0xC3><0xA1>n Kov<0xC3><0xA1>cs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Officially, the parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are on the border, have been observing the presence of armed to the teeth with vehicles and dogs there for several days.
Djerd Bakondi, Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s national security adviser, reported that 45 people who tried to cross the border were captured by the authorities at the border, and another 15 people were inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, pushing to block one of the passages a railway car wrapped with barbed wire.
The riots broke out at the main passageway across the border near the city of R<0xC3><0xB6>ské (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed an office space for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to penetrate inside, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the refusal of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race across the country, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of primary voters.
More than five months before the primary contest begins, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographic groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderates, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among the men fell significantly, and Sanders lags behind by only 5 points.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders by a two-digit number among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of primary-time Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for this party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her just because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to show more enthusiasm at her expense.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that now is the time of the woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about the association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called consent on issues and chances of election.
Since the vice president is considering potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race — though a third thinks he doesn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among party candidates, primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
By this indicator, Biden is lagging behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question that is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among their party’s primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden, of all three, leads in honesty, and Clinton’s strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don’t consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have a specific opinion on him.
Democratic primary voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar ideological views.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal mailbox and server as her secretary of state are continuing, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation on the matter and believe that this has not adversely affected their overall opinion of her.
But this is a different story from the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this was divided back in March, soon after this story became known.
Most Americans say the controversy over e-mail has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
These are mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers her party’s voters honest and trustworthy, it remains a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, are getting good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result in fairness.
Most people see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey, Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
These two candidates garnered half of the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate has risen from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted ahead of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period with 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carla Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Cassich, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio all came in third with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, a poll conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll, published last week, showed Carson’s rise in polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to Carson’s growing support last week, Trump has made several critical outbursts against the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of Baruch College freshman
About two years later, after the death of a college student during the ritual of consecration to a fraternity in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder charge was brought against five people.
“Members of the P. Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Michael Deng during the dedication ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death,” the police said.
Officials say a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach the goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The P.I. Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and were supposed to wait another hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
They did, however, find time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the Brotherhood members began hiding personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the Brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to the head, torso, and hips.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternal initiation rituals, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jurors of Monroe County favored a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against the newcomer and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only individual participants to account, but if there is an organization that has authorized all this officially or unofficially, so does her," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What will happen when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be a rise in rates, and the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will plunge into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
In particular, for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for as much as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the administration of the Central Bank of the United States so insists that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how much it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates turns out to be exaggerated.
“The Federal Reserve’s first rate hike with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, said in his comments to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect a gradual return of U.S. interest rates to a more normal level, but still lower levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react depending on historical trends:
As we have seen in the market over the past month or so, the expectation of an increase in rates can lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate increases, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t seem like stock earnings slowed for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate hike results.
If more specifically, the market over the past about 35 years has been changing sharply - about 14 percent - in the direction of an increase in the rate of the management, remains fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent for the last six cycles, subject to a prior analysis.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate increase stage, and earnings from stocks begin to decrease.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute to it.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point for the entire duration of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it is long-term, with only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic backdrop can be risky and raises the question of “will it be different this time,” Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise the Federal Reserve’s rates year-round, with their views pinned to a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading speaks to only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study since 1950, all of the rate-raising cycles to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage at GDP, bridging the pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, only it has lasted for 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market is expecting higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being implemented for stocks.
The main difference is that the effect for bonds will come faster than for stocks when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease of the rates in the cycle.
At the end of the interest rate hike cycle, bond yields drop immediately,” Deutsche said.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will lead to the return levels of long-term and short-term bonds approaching, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though “we’re still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected policy results of the federal system.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a tougher monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the policy of the Federal system.
Generally speaking, companies running their core business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be in a worse position as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks demonstrate efficiency above the market for three months after the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a stable financial condition outperformed firms with an unstable condition by an average of 5 percentage points for each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also showed better efficiency than low-quality stocks, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,” says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham slammed the station for “decreasing standards”
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinct from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply mingled with the Brits.
Damien Collins, a fellow MP who slammed The Voice with the same criticism, was not an original.
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” said the leader of parliament, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that it appears that the public radio station is “stupid” and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial competitor.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like to use the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that came to my mind first, where you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's CEO has dismissed the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn through Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and creating music really doesn’t compare to anyone else.
“Also really important, I think, is Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy argued that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to have been attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was done in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home stable” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month saw the slowest growth since it was first observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to the containment of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a leveling up of online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed minimal growth since it began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by just five percent.
Experts say that now there are signs of a leveling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” said Andy Malkehi, editor of IMRG’s Sales Index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it is coming out on the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in the amount of five times more than average rushed to computers to take advantage of profitable offers, thereby knocking down a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers enter into a real battle for bargains, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound out of every 5 pounds is spent online.
As for goods such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims bury dead after crane falls in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family face sanctions
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets, as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funerals flooded the driveway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mournful procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among those killed was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised while the crane was not working.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but said that the leaders of the company were forbidden to go outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane falling into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia’s closest ruling families for decades and has led the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was a son-in-law who the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in a pilgrimage that is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount irrevocably crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is said that the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the owner of the company B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring master craftsmen to do simple housework.
Veronica Lori, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a home furnishing service network, said that this trend is followed by a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master goods, and at the same time close 60 B&Q warehouses.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women on the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women of low sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible not to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women who are more engaged in the development of their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: “Our stores still employ mostly men.
It is necessary to take steps to achieve balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women in the management of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 percent of executives are women, including the CEO and chief financial officer.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took on the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank’s two-day meeting to discuss whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A poll of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who still thought the Federal Reserve would go for it last week now believe it will still delay and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and begin the process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubidé, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic upturn adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but everything speaks to their confidence that there is every chance against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" hundreds of refugees chant at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to migrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to sense other options of routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that transported refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything it can to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to have a humane attitude towards them.
But this is already a common European problem.
To solve it is not easy, no country in Europe alone will not cope with it, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is unyielding:
If someone calls himself a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, he will not be allowed into our country, because it is safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
Vangelis Meymarakis has been a member of the centre-right governments for a number of years, leading the country to a financial crisis, according to the left.
Now that he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by retreating from the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy has matched it in popularity.
What has changed in that time?
Vangelis Maimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was true of most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Maimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no accident that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still being implemented, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country’s creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Maimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece’s move along the European path, because we have a good idea of what the country’s exit from the EU would lead to.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to bring order to power during the first year, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the bailout program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to a recession can only be renegotiated.
It would be wrong to assume that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to reap the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Let me give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014 we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners it had.
We are moving ahead with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price paid by the Greek government.
I was a speaker of the parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that made up the government’s majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks there has been a massive flow of refugees across Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Maimarakis: The refugee crisis is a bomb of slow action that we have to deal with after winning the elections.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, you should act in advance, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And we are now in exactly that situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is receiving valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will allow us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that have happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka of the Donetsk region during the day the officers of the criminal investigation of the Main Directorate of the police of the region together with the military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kryvyi Rih (Dnepropetrovsk region), who died the night before.

The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov Irina Leonov gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are feeling well.
Recently, the Gypsies and Leonov broke up.
Evgeniy refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions.
Eugene Gyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Masterpiece of Peter Fomenko".
He is known for the films "Walk", "Space as a Premonition", "Brest Fortress", the series "Ottepel" and "Farza".

The man who opened fire at the University of the State of Delta left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he “regrets” the first murder and would like to “bring it all back,” the police said.
Police in Gothie, Mississippi, say a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a "sandman" in the house who "didn't touch anyone," but was probably upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the scene, police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to take it all back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on the evening of Monday, when he was surrounded by police, committed suicide.
University Rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was involved in the Prentiss-Schmidt affair, officials on Tuesday said there was "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Prentiss was referred to as the "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stin said he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19, and that she is "useless".
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the newspaper San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say that "he will not go to prison."
In the evening of the same day, when police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university’s website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a Doctor of Science degree in pedagogy from the University of Delta.
The Stars Who Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in the photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime companion Farrah Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this, of course, played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United has been out for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, due to which he will not be able to go out on the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno’s reckless 15th-minute run when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day later and then operated on.
It's terrible - the youngster came to Manchester United at the age of 18, he overcame great difficulties and started to play fantastically, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not given a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Riccioli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad podcast with two legs.
In a tweet, Shaw said: "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe in words how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was."

The defender of the English will have an additional incentive to improve to the European Championship in France next June.
PSV coach Philip Koku said: “It’s a very serious injury.
When any player comes out with such an injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Hale at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting an opponent, and when you hear that it's a very severe injury, you feel bad," he said.
I couldn’t see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn’t see a pod under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
It's really hard on me, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about "Lorax"?
Every parent very quickly learns one thing: if your child liked a book, it will take a little time before you get to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question from a representative of a holiday children's holiday company about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Suess in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on SuperCamps’ website, and continues: “This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my kids because it always reveals some image or message that we’re talking about.”
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the eponymous film, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled town of Allmnujville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see the real tree", - we read in the text of the description of the love story, <0xD0><0xA1><0xD0><0xB5><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD0><0xB0>.
If it doesn’t look suspicious enough, Cameron’s text is read almost as a summary of the plot of the movie “Lorax,” posted on the Internet Movie Database: “In the high-walled city of Omnivore, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Tedde is his name.
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, by common admission, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by a greedy tree-cutter and a weaver "all-rounder" Nahodkins, despite the name of the book.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to the performer, who had never read to the child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron’s headquarters, but no further comment followed.
For Adam Lit, there was clearly a risk of not getting into the England team, but it is still a difficult issue
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the test series with a score of 3-0, which happened last time, does not seem to me likely.
I wouldn’t rule out a win on my field either.
Alistair Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the bouncers who are virtuosically accepting curly balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the scars of 2012, but only the youthful positive.
With the Moen Ali ball, he turns into a bowler who delivers the curled balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Litt has left the England Test cricket team and has been replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Litt, his head coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult for me to analyze.
His seven Test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) the players choose themselves best.
A couple of half-hundreds, and Lita could have waited a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more injuries for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of the England national team, Trevor Bailiss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and this does not surprise me; he is first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how much time will pass before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression on himself is a difficult question.
He played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and someone else’s field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lith was in top form, but this missed opportunity has been in the past.
There's Alex Hales, and he's a batsman that I appreciate very much.
He’s the unpredictable cricketer we saw at the Yorkshire Club earlier this season when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, retaining four speed bowlers, is under consideration, and I'm not against it at all.
I don’t see any reason why a batsman can’t hit the ball there, and that left-hander has already shown that he’s a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not quite have what it takes for his county of Worcestershire, but he's become the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as a opener in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and in my brief communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among spinners voting “for” a little, and pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, which will bring to it the richest experience gained in all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a relentless pace in the set-up.
I’ve always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colleague Colley on the team of Durham Ben Stokes is left for the day, Ruth is given a similar break in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems about this.
Although not everyone will agree with this, coaches and the people who select the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Britain’s pro-EU exit camp could win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron’s ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is facing more and more difficulties every day, even without regard to the election of the brilliant Jeremy – “Is it yes or no?” – Corbyn as Labour leader or TUC’s outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Farage.
A friendly European diplomat has explained recently that, despite the situation in which the EU is now experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own making - some participating countries are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of sowing concessions and undermining agreements changes, which they generally do not though.
Gathering in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he didn’t want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it the Dave and George Selfie Program.
The prime minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, in a company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to keep Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the guise of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the shabby ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they do not care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany’s very cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, as she has gotten worse for sitting Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of their skins to help “selfie Brits” whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland’s exit from the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue purposely useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to fuel the UK’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
“The review was a fixed idea” and “Britain has received nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations.”
Europeans know for a fact what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical the media magnets are towards the EU, unlike the days of Tony Benn’s run-up to the 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 at a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an entrenched Euro-oportunist who became famous for his “direct EU bananas” of a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse company of tax-afraid crooks, phone-hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of exactly the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you are in a cage with a roaring gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself was in opposing Cameron’s idea of a referendum, as Blair gave in to the principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he didn’t have time to spend it on me anymore — seems to be risking repeating Neil Kinnock’s strategy of the 1980s “Boycott of Murdock” — a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy of interacting with the press — not with me, but with Andrew Marr, who sat on the couch in the Air Force on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider circle of “Little England supporters” among the Tories can probably say yes to this.
That’s the same thing that Hillary “Benn but not Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner-boyscout vehemently refusing to admit that Corbyn’s appointment as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, not going too far and not losing his post in the cabinet.
The battle of Hilary was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the peers and members of parliament in a private meeting on Monday night, according to the general public.
Whatever the Democrat and his “boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to say there – remember, he touched even me – the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the focus of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to let Cameron so easily get away from Europe, allowing him to take as his due the support of Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But MacDonnell and Corbyn’s main misconception about EU membership — within the framework of the Bennite economy of the besieged fortress — is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, engendered by slight distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato, Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that J.K. will not be campaigning for an exit – foreign diplomats will have to try to bring it to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital – they also have suspicious voters – on Britain’s concessions when it can all be pointless?
The U.S. is already very disappointed by the British military weakness in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government cuts spending, as I was reminded at a luncheon on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise Public Health England’s review of e-cigarettes
Statements by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with Lancet have criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) agency in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - the "turning point" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to some experts’ links to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the “extremely shabby argument” on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these statements were “solid or flimsy.”
Martin McKee, a professor at the European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The fundamental principle of health – rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model of multi-criteria decision-making analysis in order to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefly presented in a scientific publication.
McCoy and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certifications in the field of health in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, not to mention the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of board members was not provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom have also stated funding the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants in the meeting have management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of tobacco management at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, “excellently agrees” that there is a lack of “severe evidence of the harmful effects of most foods on most criteria,” McCoy and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these linkages and constraints were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's statements that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading to children or non-smokers" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-Being at PHE, said that BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence implies that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the far-reaching consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly stating the obvious – that although e-cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our tasks in front of the nation.
Former Channel 4 boss says BBC should end EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 boss Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create such programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are probably only watched by a small part of the audience, on peak airtime, when competitors have a high-rated show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to establish a collaboration with the BBC during his six years on Channel 4.
“I can’t help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting shows that could be shown by competing non-subsidized companies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords’ Communications Committee as part of the BBC’s further determination.
If you keep the license fee, which I don’t consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only leave on the air those programs that aren’t released and aren’t going to be released by other companies.
Show The Voice airs in a prime slot because the creators want to get the most support possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are of their own making.
Other channels would undoubtedly have given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would somehow demean the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "because of employees' ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to gain long-term support".
His comments on the most popular shows on the BBC echo those of Sky CEO Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart memorial lecture in Edinburgh offered the BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the more niche BBC public broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where you can often not assess the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hanze sermons justifying the income from the license fees of 4 billion dollars, all of which we do not have:
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita’s mission in favor of “inform, educate and entertain.”
He noted that now only a small portion of the BBC's output is formally classified as educational - according to him, this is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as “Promenade Concerts” (only some of which he says are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
In the video, you can see how the nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses too high for the human ear to hear them.
The impulses have an effect by activating neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Next Next post: Researchers Manage Brain Activity with Light
The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenesis", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, with the source of ultrasound located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Worm nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Augmented ultrasound waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect the modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the organisms of worms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this technique, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain via fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass unhindered through the body's tissues, so you do not need to pass inside the cranial box to deliver them.
“We believe that the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses to treat some neurological diseases in clinical settings will be able to temporarily make human neurons sensitive to an ultrasound signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mocking the UK’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International’s video protesting against the arms exhibition.
Shocking killer drones!
Destroying naked iron candals!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise sticks, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no trace!
The bold voice and cartoonish animation leave no doubt that this ad for the largest international arms exhibition is a vicious parody prepared by Amnesty International with the aim of drawing attention to the British government’s intention to “push” arms to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the extremities in the centre.

But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters at bus stops and on subway trains that demand to look at them again.
"An important announcement, going on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will heat up on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who exhibited their works at the Museum of Brutal Design in Banksy’s Dismaland Park.
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London, using a “sampler kit of advertising spots,” a 6-pound set of wrenches that reportedly “gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters in London are not happy about such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the exhibition Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and striving to bring political art to an audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons, welcoming passengers to the metro.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono VCCP agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and voice artist who also work for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show — with the pass in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s get them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating a more realistic and clever corporate ad, but “filling her house with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting occupation.”
“They have incredibly helped us attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty International.
We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition comes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed the information about the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting", which came from the U.S. Army.
It includes “an unrivalled cumulative warhead that brings unsurpassed reserve action inside the target.”

The eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into a dormitory as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I irritated – and the numerous, long complaints of others.
Basically, what I learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can range from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
He encourages people to chat: tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you “honestly neither love nor hate Marmite” because, seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract of HAHAHA, I’ll be at my place.”
Breathe in.
And help others to rest too - ask questions and show interest.
This keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not the ones you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were giving out extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight movie theaters, and common party spaces, but they’re also the place where people dress and mend their underwear.
Also on the topic: Don’t even think about starting a university studies, being in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to a long friendly relationship.
This can be hell for those who are trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I was able to restore the energy I spent communicating with you."
Try to feel when the classmate is tired of communication - and not to knock at him, but to send SMS.
By the way, about the tap: do this.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door wasn’t locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Factory friends with the help of baking.
Since you're starting university life at the peak of Bake-Off's popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I'll ask you something."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, probably, your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Badly glued pieces of flour, sugar and fat will rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the appropriation of someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft to take a little bit of milk for tea?
Go to the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be ashamed, even if it boils with anger inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's irritating, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat that adult as my neighbor, who poured a dishwashing liquid into her milk to avenge those who took it without question.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to improve the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then cut her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extremely, before you bite your elbows, clumsy, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got into them, broke relationships and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you will not tell your heart - but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own dust slightly.
At that exciting moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between the draw and the party is thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to Install a New Operating System on an iPhone After Apple Releases an Update
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, when an error message appears telling them that "The app update failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides, or to try to update through iTunes.
Tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase free space — but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to perform with a special utility that suggests deleting apps and re-installing them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when performing the update your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because the phone’s discharge in the process could cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia’s military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s continued support of President Assad poses a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively impacting our overall goal of fighting extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by proxy.”
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the U.S. commitment to fighting “Islamic State” within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the U.S. “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State.”
Last Friday, the White House said it did not know exactly what Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: “When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will be in favor of our interests, then he will raise the phone with us.”
Barack Obama himself sees Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime as a “loss bet.”
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that Assad’s continued support would only make the situation worse.
“But he didn’t listen to my warnings — and as a result, the situation got worse,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by the "Izvestia" assistant minister of economic development Elena Lashkin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the FSB, the FSB, the FSB, the Russian Federation - to prepare proposals for the creation of favorable conditions for the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Customs Fees, Taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties and levying of customs duties.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkin.
This issue was brought to the attention of the Sub-Commission on Customs-Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, whose meeting was held in September, and was also approved by the departments following the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release on import is in essence a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the protocol of the meeting of the sub-commission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkin explained.
In the list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, are manufactured goods for the manufacture of goods, necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for the application in the field of science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, among others.
In the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that they have prepared mandatory decrees on the sea ports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure of registration of entry and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and promenades.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of simplified procedure of entry of small, sporty sailing and pleasure ships into the seaport and the exit of the listed ships from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft decrees of the Russian government on the approval of the boundaries of the waters of the sea ports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been made, the rest are in the process of being agreed, the press service of the Ministry noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state surveillance, classification and inspection, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts year-round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area very strict rules of border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht does not even have a place to refuel.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it,” says Nordmarine’s sales director Denis Novikov.
As for the places for storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, the yachts are sent to storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has given Ukraine a loan of $500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“The new financing will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,” the statement said.
The director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps on economic reform and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the granting of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are being asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Enforcement Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgenders and transvestites in the colonies.
About this "Izvestiam" told a member of the council Vladislav Gryb.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia, who have not determined the sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide for separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Gryb emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed the appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the criminal is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Gryb is confident that the isolation of transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in the SIZO (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate chambers for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
This is the only way to deal with these criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
Humiliation of trances by chambermaids is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city, how many criminals with an uncertain sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
SIZO is definitely not needed - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
According to Gryb, the unit can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, the imprisoned transsexuals will be able to enter the punishment from any region.
Citizens are held in the SIZO at the crime scene, so the admission of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such practices for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Gryb.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officials could not decide in which investigative insulator - male or female - to determine the detainee for drug storage 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which the man with a bachelorette party was.
He was released at home on a no-show.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and media, as the mechanism of transgender content in SIZO and colonies in Russia does not yet exist.
Russian human rights activist, activist of the LGBT-movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving punishment by transgender people, noting that abroad it is also possible to identify people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is right.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgenders.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that in Russia there will be many citizens who are ready to pretend to be transsexuals in order to get into a different from the usual colony.
Of course, you can enter a medical examination before placing people in a colony for transgender people, but not always everything happens unambiguously.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change the sex, - said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But while there are no separate places to serve punishment for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transgender criminals in the colony can greatly delay the onset of punishment of convicts.
A commission is created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it is not a single test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry opportunities allow that.
Therefore, even before the change of sex, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether the change of sex with surgical intervention is the necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average, such an examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but considering that homosexuals in Russia about 5%, it can be said that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, quite a small number, "said Lordkipanidze.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people and so can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the junior world championship in chess.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the world championship in chess among juniors under 20 years of age was completed.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and they became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to chase the Pole Yan-Kshistof Duda, who seemed to confidently go to the title.
The girls were won by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Khishtof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held in the Swiss system).
Given that Duda was a favorite of the ranking of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the obtained gap seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the lag to just 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the title fight.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his party.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to optional mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for his party to finish Duda, who had met Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player brought the confrontation with the Dutchman to a close.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But in the competitions of girls an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch Bucks.
The Russian athlete remained second with a lag from the champion in 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - the region of the East.
The project will be completed by November 1.

In an interview with Russia 24 TV channel, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce "ten percent" of staff in Russia.

Igor Artemiev, the head of the FAS, said that the department opposed the indexation of 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and state subsidies, as requested by OAO RZD.
At first they wanted 17% of the indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much stricter" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on shares for the full amount of $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the share issue price in favor of Sumeru and market quotes), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or require additional payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtorg: targeted food aid will not be the same as cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be analogous to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would particularly like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed product cards with the echo of past times of total deficit, the card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, “U” wrote that the program to introduce food cards for the poor was introduced in the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is published for the 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year’s ranking.
Last year’s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the current year’s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of the company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, personnel director, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of relations with the authorities, director of corporate management.
Each proposed by experts, the manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the sectoral principle is carried out on the basis of the sectoral classifier of the Association of managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications services of the serviznik.
Each participant is given a login and password to log in to the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can post their assessments according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology of building the rating is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of your colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All candidates of the current year's rating and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to the meetings of expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the commission for the approval of the list of senior managers and eight commissions for the approval of managers of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make their updating adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms "<0xD0><0xAA>".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for investment loans is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year has increased by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic mood of late 2014 - early 2015, the lending volumes of SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans under 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If previously the bank could bet on an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from overdues to non-returns, then now it is impossible to do this: rates and so on cloud.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and form an attractive return on them.
How much do you think the demand for loans from entrepreneurs is satisfied?
After the lowering of the central bank interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future income.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to control the movement of money.
At the same time, with the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, in the end, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What major trends in the SME lending market will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a lower average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency on the issue of a lower key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs is not to be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to get real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even with the reduction of the central bank’s rates.
If we talk about the level of overdue, traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in the possibilities of replenishment of funds and in the options of correction of economic behavior, will certainly represent a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: it is attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese simply by virtue of their "Japaneseness" are able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can give as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person will agree even in principle with these arguments, but the whole conversation will unravel with the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but also everything else Japanese.
To quote from the course of Basse, to cook vassabi, to collect katanas and to dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, and according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure even after finishing school.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more strongly changes the appearance of the car a new drawing of headlights and rear lights, on which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of rigor.
No need to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only the stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a power of 175 hp - only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and a full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that behind the wheel of the CX-5 you are not in the place of your own accident.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has been redesigned for the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower lever bushings.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A bath in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It is different if the girl is crocheting in a swimsuit with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing.
It will then get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both broad shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even the long legs will surely appreciate that the resistances in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in the expressions.
Mazda’s widest range of active safety systems is available on the CX-5.
In order to identify the potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used.
There's both adaptive lighting, and a lane departure warning, and dead zone monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a cargo volume of 561 liters. The rear seats fold in a ratio of 4:2:4 - at the same time each section is equipped with a separate carrying handle - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the hero of the cartoon in Japan is called "kigurumi".
Especially the kigurumi-pajama looks ridiculous.
You can do anything in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - funny clothes, behavior or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the nuclear union.
Kiev officially issued a refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada voted on Wednesday with a second attempt to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law canceling the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block on the Khmelnytsky NPP.
The bill, introduced by the government, was passed only by a second vote, with the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill.
The Khmelnytsky NPP, which had been built under the USSR, had to have four 1 GW power units with VVER reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, in 2011-2012 the Council adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the building blocks would have to be on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to reduce relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky NPP and on the project of construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship has been preserved is the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity production in the country), since so far the Ukrainian National Nuclear Power Plant Energoatom to replace Russian supplies is nothing.
The plans for the completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014 in Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN General Assembly opposes the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told a news conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP quoted him as saying in response to a question about Russia’s military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
“There will be a meeting on Syria,” he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
"Anything can happen," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, the "U" reported that the United States does not trust the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to combat the terrorist group "Islamic State" banned in Russia.
For more on US doubts about Russia’s aid to Syria, read “The Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington.”
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," Mr Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “to return to the normal activities of our countries”.
Asked whether it is possible, in his opinion, at the moment dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was conducted, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the negotiations, the former president of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city council on the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary mandates, played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were made by representatives of the CPRF, who accused the election of "covering falsifications".
The opposition’s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election rejected the party "Communists of Russia" in the organization of a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the preparation of apartment buildings.
The municipal election officially presented the results of the elections to the pride of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voters’ lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were issued ballots for voting in the precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six seats in the pride are entrusted to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and the State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of “Just Russia” are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates will have to decide whether they will work as deputies in the city council: in the event of a rejection of the mandate, he will move to the next candidate for the party list.
Chairman of the Gorizbirkoma Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he is putting on duty to “send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others” for the purpose of renouncing the mandates.
In approving the protocol on the results of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF declared multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutskyi, a member of the Gorizbirkom with the right to vote from the CPRF, suggested not to recognize the results of the vote in the four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where the four districts were located, was closed.
Neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, could go in for a long time, and a resonant scandal with the assault on the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to a consultative vote were able to attend.
Their chief only stopped access when the vote was over and the precinct commissions had not yet come to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could attend," said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the electoral committee.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the zak meeting of the region Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UICs on election day began to seal the ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m., putting in them ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the commissions with the right of consultative vote and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the urns could throw ballots uncontrollably.
However, the mountain elector, who has already considered more than 124 complaints for various reasons, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the throws of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of her colleague from “Just Russia” Maria Popova through the lisbrink to come up with amendments to the regional legislation, in order to clearly establish the opening time of envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the urn.
"In the order of your own initiative, contact the CEC at least," - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CPRF, Sergey Samokhin, slammed the president with loud accusations, shouting that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered up falsifications in the elections.
"You're not at a rally, be careful!" - offended the chairman of the electoral commission.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election must approve the general election results, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city electoral commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" in the registration of an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod: do they agree that the fees for the preparation of apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled", and tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the legislation.
FedEx revenue is mixed, the decline in forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its forecast for annual profits due to a drop in demand for freight services and an increase in costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares shrank by about 2.5 percent at pre-bids 45 minutes before the stock exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to make $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is down despite a 4.9 percent increase in average rates, which will come into force on January 4, and an increase in fees for ground transportation of heavy or bulky goods, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year thanks to lower spending, higher gross income and growth in online commerce.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO, said the company “worked stably, taking into account the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and world trade.”
Labor plans for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts polled by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international express sector, which has led to a lack of growth in gross income in its express division.
However, the online shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from ground transportation grew by 29%, but operating revenues remained broadly unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division received a higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to increased labor costs.
At pre-sale about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange opened, the stock fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
At the most expected meeting in a few years, the heads of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table made of Honduran red wood, deciding whether it is not time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room two stories high above them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country’s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the federal system have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And that third injunction may prove to be an unknown factor in the near-forecast decision that will be announced Thursday on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by a near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data shows confident economic growth, the recent upheavals in global financial markets can keep the already cautious leaders of the federal system from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds — even just by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at broker Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait any longer,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve system, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid upswing.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow by promising that the next raise will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the Federal System’s strategy makers would drop the bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does so, “they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that the rate hike could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 percent this month, making the first small step in slowly tightening financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from the liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed, the growth of the labor market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level that the federal system considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s 2% annual target, the Federal System’s leadership said the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market,” noted Ian Schefferdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average index for industrial stocks fell by as much as 16 percent to a relatively high level in May, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market has partially recovered its positions this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10 percent below its high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve system, market turmoil further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would start to screw up at this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences could be for the U.S. economy, and they have almost no reliable data since recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the federal system, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
The Federal Reserve System has become the world’s financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
One hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “muffle” its monetary expansion has caused shocks to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that the heads of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “art rather than science,” said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that pursues global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there have been instances of overreactions to financial market movements that seem unrelated to economic principles.”
Laker, a member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% over three sessions, “despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth,” Laker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal system canceled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises such as the market crash of 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The latest panic didn’t get close to that level, he said.
“You wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re afraid of rising rates because markets are experiencing shocks,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and doesn’t mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.
Do you need a good Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Taitown.
Market / warehouse - a shop where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it will take more than an hour to brush all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy groceries at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The cooking department in the store (good and inexpensive) is located near the cash desk and offers various options for take-out.
What is offered: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices for goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold wholesale.
Fresh produce includes delicate Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits, and more.
The meat counter is as varied as the fish counter – the staff behind the counter will clean and divide the fish, and even grill it for you if you want.
The bulk of the store is dedicated to an impressive freezing department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, duck whole, fish, beef blood and birch, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished products and much more.
Who buys there: Owners and chefs of restaurants, as well as families and individual buyers.
In the wide passage are placed and shopping carts, and forklifts.
Finding: Fresh durian mountong near the exit.
Where it's located: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the edge of the Chinese Quarter and the city's business center, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees flow into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?” he asked.
After all, it must have been someone who assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and destitute people who are escaping death, would rush to the prosperous countries of the EU.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many political leaders in Europe spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally engulfing their countries?”
“No, old Europe, with the rare exception, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially looked at and looked at how the moral ideals and the basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are being eroded by the military shoe, sewn according to NATO standards,” he said.
The government troops and loyal militarized formations are opposed by insurgents, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in Russia joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
The official Damascus considers such insurgents as terrorists.
Syria’s president called the reason for the West’s hostility to Russia.
The West’s claims to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of the Western media with the start of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power undemocratically, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves – at the request of the people, and not at the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president remains, otherwise he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation with them is being carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he said.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them with a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Isil coalition, led by the United States," Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.
The U.S.-led international coalition is launching airstrikes against ISIS positions.
In Utah, 12 people were killed by the flood.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of the flood.
Another is believed to be missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed several cars with people in them in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a dangerous zone near the water, and the flow suddenly overtook him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All those killed were residents of the Colorado City and Hildale areas that were affected by the disaster.
Three children were also reported to have been rescued.
In search and rescue operations, 650 teams are involved.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
The topic of discussion was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
At the same time, he said that the US has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, during the conversation with Kerry, Lavrov once again emphasized the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating in the territory of the country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were addressed.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov said that the country will not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist organization "Islamic State".
The U.S.-led international coalition is targeting ISIS positions with airstrikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper defamation of Strelkov.
The former head of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenty.ru".
The Washington Post is a good place to say that everything has been changed.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "exited" him from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three furs of money, which are attributed to him by different characters, - he noted.
According to Boroday, the talk about Strelkov in conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he does not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "connected".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, then it's amazingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left himself," Borodai noted.
"It's an insult to me and to Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodoy's words about the fact that he exported Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced order.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to tie his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish lumberjacks began to cut down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rumors about the railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train there may be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of the train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland’s Deputy Minister of Culture, Petr Zhukhovsky, said that local miners with a “probability of 99 percent” had found the same train with Third Reich gold, which is mentioned in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valb<0xC5><0xBC>ych with a message that they found a train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief addict of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief addict has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - acts particularly harmful".
So he said on the live broadcast of the radio station “Speaks Moscow”, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Sovfeda Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years.
The man is growing up unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, the person is physically ready for this.
Mentally he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
“It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, does not fully mature until the age of 21,” Brun said.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Tresovaya Russia" Sultan Hamzaev told "Izvestia" that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age price when selling alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the site of the upper chamber of parliament".
According to the activist, the Federation Council will soon create a working group to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check for compliance with the law on information protection of children
The resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development", the statement on September 16 was read by the correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the application stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased in the store "Chitai-city" on Red Avenue the Bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the FZ "On the protection of children from information that causes harm to their health and development".
On September 16, the statement was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, it is quite a fundamental problem that will stir up society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it has not done before.
The Brazilian Union of Pediatricians of Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has invented a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of babies sucking breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children get all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily norm of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that a single calorie gain isn’t the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the immune system of the child has been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train blew up a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus, which was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move from the tracks, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, there was a collision in their eyes.
It was filmed by one of the students.
Due to the emergency situation, panic arose among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was hurt by the miracle, except one passenger of the train, who received minor injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was taken to a hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life-saving device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one battle ended in a draw.
He has two children.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student, Bradon Smith, died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
"I understand that this is happening unintentionally," said Stephen Parniss, the organization's vice president.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when the athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practicing physicians and medical students.
Sergey Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin called inadmissible the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated this at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We see this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue,” the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morale back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let us return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
“Twins have never ended well,” he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma urged parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security tasks.
“First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” Naryshkin said.
He also said that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
I enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to win the European team championship, to set several records, and most importantly to become the world champion, the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the "Brilliant League", taking the third place overall.
The New Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the upcoming season.
Is the season not over yet?
Yes, I am going to speak at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It’s easier than riding around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season have boiled away, the burden of responsibility is no longer suppressed.
You can compete for pleasure, for "relaxation".
Plus, you know, vacation's coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Tiredness at the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what you do, win or lose.
Every competition is a stress.
Constant flights, movements - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
Tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
Oh, come on, I'm just happy!
By the time you finished the World Cup in Beijing, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you, the journalists, do not let me forget that.
But in general, I believe that it is bad for an athlete who lives with old victories to run his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we have to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at congregations, then back home.
Everything as usual.
But with the coach, the task was set: to try to reach a new level, which I had not yet reached.
Almost all winter time was spent on laying the foundation.
We attacked a bunch of crosses, did exercises on general physical training, which included both the thrust, and the harness, and the back we pumped.
Then they took on the barrier training, did a lot of technical work.
Were they watching the way the competitors were doing?
I always try to do it, the good in the age of the Internet has no problem with that.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was taken by the French!
I thought, you have to do something, you have to dilute this company.
With every start this season, you’ve added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
The last few seasons have all been pretty much the same.
There is no such thing that I run first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I’m always rolling out my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your readiness is not always.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not go to the final. - "WE") tried to forget immediately.
It was very good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he had repeated his best result at the time, he would have become a bronze medalist in the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What do you mean?
It was in Tagus.
I really wanted to go to the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right from the mornin', in the preliminaries.
Then I realized that to tear and carry a broken head means to not run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold"!
How to develop a decent speed, not to lose even a head, not to disconnect?
But that's the most difficult part.
You need to be very careful, focused on the technique, so as not to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is so much easier.
And the most high, when you have the feeling that you are running and everything as if by itself turns out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the deep after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, I've been into athletics.
In fact, I trained first with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
It was a child's fight - it's when they throw the ball, jump in length from the place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race, it was possible to meet the norm of the second adult class.
That's the way it is.
Has there never been a fear of barriers?
I was able to make a deal with them immediately.
There has always been a lot of work to be done on technology.
There was a lot of suffering there!
But this routine doesn’t go anywhere.
The technique has to be sharpened constantly - so that I can wake up at night, I immediately get up and would run through the barriers.
Anyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful race.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't review my runs, and I couldn't stay here.
But efficiency needs to be worked on – there are no limits to perfection.
Aren’t you now afraid that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, then you must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I am not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them with bread - give, take the enemy.
And although I did not wave the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same, a million times said here, and directly called no one a bastard, I was struck by another.
All my pseudo-friends blinked, evaporating for a second.
The pressure I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, who's seen the kinds of guys, think people are white.
It's like he's walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a crowd and you're mutating.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm going to hit from the howitzer, old me, guys, to be afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite it.
And to give passports to such freaks as Fred Durst or Monson, can only fools.
I'd rather, the best journalist, work unashamedly.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in a sharp form:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula was a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to the way Khrushchev tried to sign something, does not in any way fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking away his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will only end there.
I’m almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some bastard from the Kremlin’s wall.
I have an idea who this could have been...
Cobzone doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise 7 leads in the ranking despite Ninth attempts to highlight the loss of leaders in Today Show
The departure of Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party’s statement on the release of the leader’s seat failed to raise the Today rating strongly.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the state capital after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
The contestant - Sunrise - with the leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weeklong series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This remote torture did not seem to matter much to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise’s audience of 397,000 in the five largest cities, compared to Today’s audience of 339,000.
Today gained a little more compared to its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 at Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for clarifying!
Published TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015 <0xD0><0xB3>.
An important news for the Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the recently widowed father of a family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has amassed an impressive audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were discussing whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a loud "yes" response.
The X Factor 7 remained in a strong position with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh mixed luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV series, led by Andrew O'Keefe, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGweira (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of Chase Australia attracted 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour was a staggering 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to replay the MacGyver show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellouse, Sarah McKay, and Snow White Marcoski may have accidentally been given the chance to figure out which of them will win at The Lobster.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in The Lobster, is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, keep silent about who exactly received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow White and Lana Jevons-Fellow on the eve of the day when two of the three girls will have to stay, they may have suddenly hinted at the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his silence until the finale, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, and joie de vivre as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could involuntarily indicate which of them actually won the heart of "The Rooster".
Jevons-Fellows and Marcosque unquestioningly called MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
There was a good relationship between Sarah and Sam from day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and I understood that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it,” said Jevons-Fellouse.
"Sarah is a very open person, with her easy and fun," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to make a great couple.
MacKay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be “the same person.”
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game – I wholeheartedly believed in him,” she says.
When asked who to choose, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor will air on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle became very interested in him after his move to the United States – as did many other clubs that sent in requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which a former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pawn in a win game with Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to return the pant, and also involved him in the game after the injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself from a good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of making a difference to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he cheered them on.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers club special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from Thomas McGowan, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the panda by the Minnesota Waikings during the first quarter
At the beginning of his NHL debut, Hayne and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect it.
It was seen as Hayne bluffing as he left the field after losing the ball, and he later told host Hamish and Andy on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a ball throw in his designated zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at the risk of using weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
At the border of Hungary, there were clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian village of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw police stones and attempt to demolish a fence on the border.
The site of the clashes is being reinforced, police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading for Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities of the country allowed the migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the transfer of the functions of the Hungarian border guard to the armed forces of the country's parliament in the near future.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a barbed wire fence 175 km long on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian has admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
Accused of the largest ever U.S. cyberattack, Russian Vladimir Drinkman confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to colluding to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian told about the collusion with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at 300 million dollars.
“Replicants such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison and a million-dollar fine.
When issuing a sentence, the court will take into account the recognition of the Russian and may reduce his term.
Drinkman will be sentenced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia’s support of Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our overall goal of fighting extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the website said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the secretary of state, Assad “can never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
During the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened to isolate Russia if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often reports about the presence of Russian troops on the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country’s proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plains of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesi people say that the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, this was a decisive step on the way to a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Lawmakers voted in favour of the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
Built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, it has developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk headed a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent "Regional".
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of the audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of the local budget.
An audit of the municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document turnover to five days.
Previously, the paperwork could go on for months at a time.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
In the city there was no design and estimate documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without it, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the road, kindergarten, northern sewer collector and water supply.
Road works are already underway at two sites.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
No such positive demographics have been observed in the city in the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most relevant.
Since September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for overhaul.
The estimated cost of repair - 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, the kindergarten No. 23, which is now visited by 200 children, was opened.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from regional and local budgets, its cost was more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, and the People's Initiatives program helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the priority of children from the age of one and a half to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be engaged, first of all, Syan enterprises, it is they need to provide work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphaned children in the Leningrad microdistrict is put into operation.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has entered the program to build economy-class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square meters of housing for those wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should not be more than 30 thousand rubles per one square meter, this cost includes a "turnkey" finish.
If we manage the specified volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pork complex was built on the territory, which was sold in 2004 for a priceless price.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to object to this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 hectares to regional property is resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pork complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 agreements of social and economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
The companies such as Vostok Center, Novo-Ziminskaya Power Plant, Sayan Broiler LLC, MDF PK Ltd, the management of these enterprises respond to all requests, provide tangible support.
Directly to the Day of the city LLC "Syansky Broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repair of the horse yard, where specialists are engaged in children's therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city of ZAGS.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s Day in a colorful way.
As in the good old days, there was a parade with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sian poets, was published.
First-time builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk have been awarded anniversary medals.
Sponsors are also involved in the work of the City Charitable Foundation.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
For the solution of the personnel issue, the provision of housing specialists is of great importance.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers have received service housing.
We have a housing allocation program with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans include a redevelopment of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important of all crises to draw the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on indexation of social pensions taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma has introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - MP from Fair Russia Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the subsistence minimum of a pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva stated the inadmissibility of sanctions against lawmakers participating in the Assembly's activities.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected in support of Canerva’s position.
"There has already been enough strong support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect signatures of deputies, which pointed to the inadmissibility of the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the European Union’s governing bodies and “send a corresponding petition”.
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent.
The broad front of the low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure area roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, Miami-based opticians say.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced the start of a campaign to double donations designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping stranded European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement made by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold, and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the Google.com/refugeerelief page reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics With Little Obesity May Help Obesity Surgery
The beneficial effect after surgery for obesity in people with low-fat type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to argue that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics don’t show up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in a column by JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
For several years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbid obesity who had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with IMT above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery – gastric shunt and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT in those who received nonsurgical treatment for diabetes remains at approximately 29 levels.
Among those who underwent the operation, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and in part - 28%.
In the group receiving drug treatment, for comparison, complete cure for diabetes was observed only in 1%, and partial - only about 2%.
In addition, indicators of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors say.
The researchers also monitored hemoglobin A1c levels in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected by good A1c hemoglobin levels, did not reduce the death rate by five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group who completed the sleeve gastrectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was also closer to full remission (against dimethasis, versus 14.2 kg).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower compared to a group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“This report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient’s BMI falls into the range between 27 and 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse that.
In Mytischi, the robbers took out of the house a coat and 9 million rubles.
In Mytischy, the robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers through an open door entered the house, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the house owner and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article "Theft".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get a permit.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of "Rosbalta" believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting removable apartments will increase by 10-30%, and even after the championship for removable housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel of St. Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents at the request of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now literally every number on the account, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy committee for tourism development of Nana Gwichia, at the moment only 23 hotels have been classified – so many inspections have been carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny is not known by the surprising coincidence of circumstances.
That is, there may be more classifications, but no one knows about it.
“For the last six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification,” said the director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets in which there were no expenses for checks, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
But in recent times, hotel managers have stepped up and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels need to make it to July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also not get the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that depending on the star rating, a fixed fee will be developed for the room in the hotel for the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to prevent a 200-300% rise in prices, as happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to have a conscience and not to allow an increase of two or three times, but also to let the hotels earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to an understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better to travel without interruption,” he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State Duma have introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential houses.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved,” says Nana Gwachia.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels should in any case be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, about 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will close, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to Leonid Garbar, President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a shift towards four- and five-star hotels.
Such a situation is similar to the situation when “in the 80,000th stadium there are 75,000 cheerleaders”.
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban the expert considers "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if as a hotel, in which guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk of missing the World Cup in football and because of their insolence.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and they dig the pit themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that travel," - noted Gennadiy Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the momentary checks on the date.
The reason for the delay in St. Petersburg is due, among other things, to the constant reshuffles in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that you will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come in vans, in which it will be possible to stay overnight.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that they are empty afterwards," Gennady Lamshin said.
Also, a great popularity during the football championship will enjoy a removable housing.
Most likely, a reserve of removable apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first will leave the housing near the stadium," - said a specialist in the rental of the Agency for development and research in real estate Larisa Bragina.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, in which people not only point the way, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother and two children.
They were nowhere to sleep: with hotels it was difficult then, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
“And Dad took them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interviewer recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such trait in the inhabitants of the city - to call home is fraught with consequences and terrible.
But perhaps in 2018 after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "melted" the Amur region.
Today I looked with admiration at the clown Zhirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it would seem, is "the protest of the LDPR against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
Protocols do not shake - for nothing; protocols other than those signed by the electoral commissions, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he lifts the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then nothing is thrown at Rodinna, and then, after the quarrel with the chairman, he leads the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Indeed, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is Zhirinovsky’s next “Podonki!”-style exit, not a protest by the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction has formally scandalized, and the election, if you believe the party's website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader of the issue is obviously descending.
Allows the dead on Amur to bury their dead themselves, and himself preaches against the "United Russia" in general and the innocent Motherland.
An elegant solution, so that both the face is not lost, and in the real, and not the showy scandal not to go.
Another thing that is now in a strange position is Abramov himself.
Except for the shouts from the chief, he did not expect anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for the narrow circle, it was he who became the formal reason for insulting the respected champion, and, even more coolly, the ham attacks against the EP and the ONF.
And, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 of the only regional single-mandate district, it can turn into a pariah, which successfully used its own party leadership and super-irritant for the same ONF and party leadership of a stranger.
That's for sure - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should be invented and observed respectfully.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There is news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
The bathroom fell out of nothing.
Only, the subject of Abramov buried under himself.
Beautiful indeed.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Oxford Centre for Compassionate Research on Ethics at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama had strongly objected to the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
Taking care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you need to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the terrorist acts of 9/11, saying that the U.S. response had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of ingestion by children under the age of 12 of hand sanitizer fluids reported in toxicology centers increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children come into contact with these substances more often and, unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the emergency department,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluids specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social networks.
In the videos on Youtube, you can see how teenagers drink disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
Teenagers are reported to have mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing mouth rinse fluid to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
“The kid doesn’t think it can hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand fluids) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Steven Thornton, chief physician at the University of Kansas Hospital Toxicology Center.
You wouldn’t just leave a whiskey roll like that, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a large amount of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand sanitizer with a strawberry flavor in about four sprays at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be in a state of alcoholic intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
“It was very scary,” Scott, Naji’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from the children's reach zone.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a disinfectant containing a toxic unspecified ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three four-year-old students in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposite” teacher by “spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand sanitizers, and she has banned keeping them in her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was “empty talk” and are addressing discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad cast iron owl.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
He has been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, put plays on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes and rewritten with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper “Young Stalinets” wrote in 1939, every day “the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children’s library of Barnaul” became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her children’s photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna does not mind that the library was given her name, she wrote that she did not, does not mind.
The letters have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain, whose severe profile decorates the bas-relief on the building of the library.
In the years of restructuring, people often called different people, were upset: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political paint!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as a "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path made of yellow brick.
"The Magician of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and was distinguished from all other managers only by her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer".
Olya made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it, unless you create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and composes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space.
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says Tatiana Kushvid, director of the library.
In recent years we have even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think my interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library of the whole family: mom, dad and children are hung.
The library is glad that with the children, more and more popes began to come.
If at two years of age the child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law under which an eight-year-old prodigy is prohibited from issuing books from category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring with him parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of owls with hiccups and eras, to tell Korolenko in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are not only the conceptual space of the “temple of the book”, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school,” explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can all come together to read, play, draw.
We have made a play area for children - the child comes just to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they resist with their feet, do not want to leave.
Often moms come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places where you have to come with babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: modern children, just like we used to, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is now evolving, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors, who are the link between generations.”
And if we talk about little children, it is important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books to pay attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege only exists in children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookcase.
The steps will scratch under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet like with an old friend: hello, it's good that you and I do not change.
Ellie is still having fun walking along the road paved with yellow brick, Toly Ryzhikov's tape steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kybalchish never told the damned bourgeois of the Military Secret - he has such a strong word.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can recognize yours anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of bins with handles and eras.
Or to tell Korolenko in the famous app for the magazine "Niva".
Or the "Murzillki" lining for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of everything - I will retire and take care of rare children's books.
But children for this already, so to speak, will not behave: and the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write out this "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the bookstore.
The pages of Murzilki have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs a bookstore all her life.
She knows what color caps Buratino has, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Griffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motorcyclist, and who works father Alice Selezneva.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and anyone who can live without these book series finds a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, educators, worshippers of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I love children's books in general: as a librarian I like them to be, so that they stand exactly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the riders.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
Rumors mill: There are no differences in "Celtic"
Griffiths refuted the Celtic controversy after admitting to Dale that the Hoops were in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
The Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nealson, and Worberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team's unity.
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Celtic" to five points
Adam Rooney's penalties in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodry, allowing Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths refuted the disagreements.
This has sparked rumors of disagreements in Celtic, which have been suppressed by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates do not suffer from any heightened criticism as they prepare to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don’t think we feel the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored, because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Bour
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national team member Ronald de Bour said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic as he did not compete for the title with the Rangers.
De Burr, currently a representative of Ajax, said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the most attractive moments of the Celtic games, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it’s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
“I will change everything,” Dale said.
Ronnie Dale has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
The defeat of Malmo and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 players of Aberdeen, who now, having scored five points, takes the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, "The Village had bad periods before, and we're going out again."
We want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it’s very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what’s going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic’s support, because that makes the players a lot better.
Staying together is so important now.
Worberton confidently waits for January transfers
Despite opinions appearing just a few weeks ago suggesting that he has defined some of the goals of the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Worberton is suspicious of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
A former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period for their adaptation, which you’ve seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in "Celtic", hinted about the end of his career
Sweeney striker Mitchu, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with Swans ended.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to face the SFA over Nealson's claims
The Harts led with a 2:1 score when Patterson was removed, and began to lose 3:2, but the defender's red card was later canceled; this is the third red card of Columbus, canceled in eight months.
Nelson did not give up his words, stating, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths Swears to Avoid Tinkasl
The stubborn player of the team "Hybernian" received a reprimand after admitting that he sang a song with offensive words about the former player "Harts" Rudy Scatzel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was burning," the striker said, adding: "I can say with confidence that I wasn't going to return to Tinkasl if he doesn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis board confident in management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly argues that the board of directors of Dundee United remains confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field must end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to come out again," Donnelly said.
MacInnes is glad that "unbelievable" won at Hamilton
Derek MacKinness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assisi to achieve a seventh consecutive victory in the league championship, putting them five points above the Celtics, at the top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said: “There is no team here that has won anything – a cup or a league championship that has not won a match in this way.”
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is rising.
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, while the number of workers now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, higher than the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market situation in Scotland with employment growth and a reduction in unemployment.
Why I'm a Witness to the Oklahoma Execution
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a person being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting on the death row in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made back in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique opportunity.
Yes, journalists are allowed to be present at executions in America, and since those who often want more than seats, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of places for the press was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we’ve had our own relationship with him after months of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I’m not allowed to take a note and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving in to my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better” herself, but still thinks I’m wrong about what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he said it.
I told him he could cut me off from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement for the abolition of the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I’ve recorded.
I won't go into details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that the evidence for the death sentence was not sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that point of view, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'm being completely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
You will learn from me what it is like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
The man who was being chased by the police was persuaded to leave the Canning River.
The constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade the man to get out of the Canning River, and to stay dry himself.
The Perth resident intended to leave the police, but failed to do so by getting stuck in the dirty shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to “easily persuade him to go to shore.”
Canning-Wales police were called on Tuesday to investigate the illegal entry into someone else's territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, come on, get me,'" Sgt. Chandell Castledain said.
Constable Laklan Perhavets did not like to urinate, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good policeman".
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Senior Sergeant Castledine.
That’s exactly what football champion Ben Casinos remembered.
In 2006, Cassin went to the Cove to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but led the locals to invent the funny "Ben Kazins biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses flight attendants of spying and threatens to leave equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused the Racing Victoria stewards of trying to smuggle a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
His target was the stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the dismissal of Lady Tatai from the start due to the violation of the rules of the use of drugs on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always makes every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidara’s cobalt test, which he can’t explain.
He kept his tongue about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like green grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve tolerated it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of line that you don’t even bother anymore,” Moody said.
They know it has continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I'm going home and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know I’m doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it’s not, then I’m going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I’ll name if asked, and offered him a job at my stable to pass on information about what I’m doing at my stable,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all, no doubt, file a claim, because they failed to try to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, current CEO of RVL, have known about it all along and are now aware of it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's personal?
Shouldn’t the RVL have the courage to call for accountability for what’s going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I bad at this profession?
Am I bad at this profession?
Maybe people there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I will put pressure on them and I will put responsibility on them for making a decision.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari case, and the recent removal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could "throw his license on the table".
Moody, best known for preparing invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition “ridiculous” after a clay compress was applied to the horse’s feet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on the jumps.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Muddy can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition for the use of the compress, about which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver, who made the raid and hid from the scene of the incident in Cobram, was arrested
Police arrested a man who shot a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was shot down by a car on Murray Valley Highway in the morning of Saturday.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, failure to provide assistance and violation of other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in a stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Parrying Accusations of Competitors of Harsh Force
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the interception of the ball as an "imposing of the agenda" by two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Rusters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to “fight” with his team during Storm’s sudden victory in the final of the Sydney qualifiers on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at the Nusern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "typical" for the rugby league and said that the two teams were not involved.
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were simply focused on “contact” intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was convinced by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as this means that they are worried about a possible defeat from Storm.
“It keeps popping up — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about tough receptions when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
“I can assure you that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for a whole year, just over the last six weeks we’ve paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and that’s been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he’s clearly training a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing, and it’s been a bit of a shock to him.
Funny how it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the kind of football you’d want to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit of a game-changer with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and the Rusters were competing with more points than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this an impressive football?
Or to consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
This is routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
Storm has a weekend away at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys, or the next Saturday night's Coronalla Sharks in the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of drug possession Serb released on bail of $200,000
A man facing life in prison for trying to appropriate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by a smuggler has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht sailing from South America through Vanuatu and moored in Kumar in August.
During the whole morning Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the dock, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maximovich faces a lifetime for trying to appropriate drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole party, and that the man could have been in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich’s mother and stepfather were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It is clear from the testimony of both of them that the amount of the $200,000 pledge is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But one measure is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, will be reported to the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the team of Greece, which fought until the last seconds".
Head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 final of Eurobasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game,” Katzikarisa told AFP.
We were preparing for a great game with the Spaniards.
They tried to work in the defense, but mistakes in the defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA, I will be assigned the functions of a Kaun."
CSKA newcomer Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive buildings, and with a thrashing, with a thrashing.
Yes, it will take me some time to restructure to the central position, but in the NBA I played more forward.
Now you'll have to face the big center opponent more, but I've done this before, so I think I can do it now.
The Armenians last won the EuroLeague in 2008.
Since then, they have gone to the Final Four six times, but they have not been able to show their best basketball every time.
There's an opinion that someone has slurred the team.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance of winning the EuroLeague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eyes, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to the music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: “For me, the match with Roma will be special.”
The head coach of Barcelona Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the first round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Rome" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the eye fight of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the "wolf" in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA words of Luis Enrique. -
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Cup of Joan Gamper will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game that she showed in series A against Juventus.
It is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar" has different options for attacking actions.
Acting head coach of Ural Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.

The match will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see - the official website of "Ural" the words of Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different options of attacking actions, carries out its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time and we team is not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting a Europa League match against Dortmund’s Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "The house of Astana can take away the glasses from anyone."
Astana midfielder Roher Kanyes after the first round match of the Champions League group tournament with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Habbek, on their field, the Astanans are able to pick up points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - says the official website of UEFA Kanyes. - We had a little lack of courage in the attack.
"Benfica is higher than the class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to pick up their points.
It's quite real.
But first we need to think about the Galatasaray, and then about Atletico.
In home matches, we can pick up points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: “I will repeat as many times as I like: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.”
The head coach of "Real" Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with the big victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Shakhter" (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, - says the official website of UEFA Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks always hide danger.
I won’t say that Real played perfectly, but we had enough goals.
I’m glad we didn’t miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
“He’s the best player in the world, I’ll repeat it as many times as I want.
Jordi Alba: Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be compared to Messi.
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that with his teammate Lionel Messi, no one can compare.
According to the Spaniard, Cristiano Ronaldo’s “Real” forward can’t do that either.
Messi has five goals ahead of the rest, according to Le Figaro Alba, “What Leo is capable of, no one can do.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.

Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group tournament match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let us remind you that "SE" will conduct its text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players," the official website of UEFA De Rossi quoted him as saying.
With blue grenades it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
“To leave them, we’ll have to swing all the way through the game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he goes to the waterfront, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
Yezhov hopes to enter the starting line-up of SKA in the match with "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to enter the starting line-up of the army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov went on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next match the team will hold at the departure against "Slovan".
I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Yezhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, we don't show repeats of missed goals, so it's hard to track.
"Dynamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I would have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova went to the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.

Stephen Hogg used a girl’s phone to get pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to solicit images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and logged in to the online messaging service, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found shocking photos, then immediately turned her mother’s attention to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address, and found "appropriate" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police that he did it because it could "attract paedophiles" and then "pretend he's a cop to scare them."
Commissioner Eileen Robertson told the Sheriff’s Court in Dundee: “He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and that he had asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had trouble with his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then an eyeball was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, violating bail conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Respondent’s lawyer, Gregor Sim, filed a motion not to list Hogg on the list of sexual offenders, as it can be shown that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing until October, until he received a certificate from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody before the hearings on other remaining cases began.
He was included in the list of persons who had committed sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is reading the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest state leader, fell off the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them of the intoxication of Mugabe during the address.
A month ago, they whistled at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was this speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled ‘Death,’” he told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the distinguished Members of Parliament that immunity ends in the Parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Zwangirai, was “concerned” about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its restructuring and cost-cutting programme in the service sector.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two publicly traded companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service operations sectors.
The deductions resulting from the projected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“Such a restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Hewlett Packard President and CEO, Maggie Whitman, who will lead the organization after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, helping the company transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing companies with previously unattainable integrated technology solutions,” the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hullett and Dave Pacard to produce electrical equipment, splits; their Palo Alto garage has been dubbed “the birthplace of Silicon Valley.”
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization with the aim of moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that highly specialized companies work better.
Arsenal captain Michael Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb game
In a conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided that Wilshere's recovery would go as planned, there would be nothing stopping him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
What’s most offensive about this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to ankles or injuries that have occurred to him before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a risk of additional injuries associated with this for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 games in the league over the past five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs of the Premier League, the ones with the most missed days due to injuries.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes, when you get back in shape after an injury, you’ve been vulnerable for a while — during that time, you need to rebuild your strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he recovers physically, I’m sure, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal will start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games with Chelsea and the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to conduct a rotation of the squad.
Hector Beljerin and Aaron Ramsi did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting lineup will play Mathieu Debussy and Arteta.
Wenger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Girau instead of Nacho Morale and Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are an absolute favourite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most disappointing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 games since they managed to spend last season as the Invincible.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-point earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have mastered the lesson learned last season when the team was defeated in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with an experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate the need for men to be honest has become, now more than ever, despite the fact that the suicide rate among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to address the issue of the Campaign Against Unfortunate Living, it declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient had a large enough number of friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of a cure doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chance of developing mental disorders.
But, of course, for the friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an age when communication is driven by social media, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal aspiration for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the creator of video games, recently noticed, you will not buy happiness for money at all.
The advantage of friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s sighing of Rachel – all come from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me, “...my role as a listener for people who experience depression and suicidal moods underscores how even the smallest of friends can benefit.”
Often those men who turn to us, feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching “lives with it” is strong, as is the feeling that an open conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-running coping mechanisms.
It emphasized the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, and long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where decorations have been completely restored for the holiday, why not take your friends a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
It is impossible to predict what the benefits of friendship will be.

Di Maria scores a goal, helping PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matthews and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the ball in Malmo's goal.
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal, allowing PSG to easily bypass Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their case when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc de Prance stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after starting his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Pari needed to make a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they aimed not to qualify for the play-offs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in the game against the team from his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or at home in the Champions League, so to win with a score of 2:0, to deliver problems to opponents and to play well in defense is a good start, even if there are still points that we will need to improve during the season,” said Blanc.
That's promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutes in the Paris team, which brought her a 2:2 draw against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was pushed back by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player able to take PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought out last month by Manchester United, and he proved why, when he ran for the pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malmo and beautifully finished the attack on Vielha, he sent Vielha to the attack.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of a strike by Nikola Djurji<0xC4><0x87>, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's far pole in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
But PSG has at times failed itself with inconsequential transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to make at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball struck by Kavanie immediately after the restart of the game.
However, he proved to be much more proficient in accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who, Di Maria, sent the ball with a twisted punch, which went into a push to the pole past Wieland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the clock was ticked by Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball of the season after Ibrahimovi<0xC4><0x87> adjusted the ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas Malmo had about getting back into the game, and only a close-range interception by Willand did not allow David Louis to increase the final score before a substitute Ezekiel Lavessa scored the goal in the match itself.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.”
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Xi Jinping's first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping with his wife Pen Liyuan at a government dinner the same evening after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the presidents of the United States and China to approach the controversial topics constructively," the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle for a meeting with the heads of several leading U.S. technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then travel to New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concern about China’s alleged cyberespionage and China’s growing assertiveness over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

The BMW car, which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the opposite lane and shot down the motorcyclist standing on the side.
From the injuries received, the man born in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the driver of BMW was driving at high speed and in front of the accident went to the opposite lane.

The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugl, who was part of the official delegation, tells about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links of relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
In the framework of plenary and section meetings, we will talk about the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory and legal support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates participated in the work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our achievements is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar was held in Tyumen at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.

The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be discussed - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options for the prevention of losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about the further supply of passenger and cargo equipment of OJSC "MAZ", the development of the service center of OJSC "MAZ", which was established in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC "TPATP".
The discussion also touched on the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of discussion was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These issues also affected the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moore we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the handlebars", so a new batch of cars from Belarus, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel, is required.
Another aspect: Tyumen lift plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products of JSC "Mogilevliftmash", receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that as part of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaural was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a hub for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their acuteness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the stake, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking.
Matt Damon has argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition does not need to be taken into account.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view for the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the movie itself, not for the show,” Damon insisted.
Crazed Brown, not believing her ears, insultedly shouted "Ogo! Nothing to myself. Well," all the time, while the actor from "Marsiana" was giving comments on the live broadcast.
To discuss the finalists of the show, producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers joined Damon and Brown.
“I would like the participants – no matter who is the director – to think about what interpretations of the image of Harmony they are going to adhere to,” Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of the film Dear White People advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end we can get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni was furious about the video: “Clarifying the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room is so white that it hurts.”
Twitter has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s remarks come at a time when proper coverage of the racial issue in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the contenders in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News co-worker Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be viewed as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional rock climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldeiro became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior" on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
In this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants has yet managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two participants - Caldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task involved climbing a rope that was 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and settled in a set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior", having passed the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero managed the task by as much as three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory, Caldeiro, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“It’s incredible to think about it, I’ve never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E!.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined what it was like... the future was unknown.
Executive producer Kent Wid met with reporters at The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who first crossed the line, won’t receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
“If there’s more than one finisher, the prize gets the fastest of them,” Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changing, it still gets a huge satisfaction.
I don't think he's offended by that.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received a ton of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and family.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff said to me, “If I was going to lose someone, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" quietly bypassing "Minnesota Twins"
Minneapolis - The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now ranked last in the Central Division of the American League.
Pretending only to be an obstacle, the Tigers won brilliantly Tuesday at the Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to reduce their half-game lag from the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs by the number of points after the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the letter F, which eschewed most of the second half of the season.
“All the winnings are fun, no matter how they turn out,” said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three innings.
It was only his third quality start in nine outings.
“I just want to end the year with good numbers,” Simon said.
Pitchers can’t be replaced in every game, and that’s why I want to go deeper into the game.
The Tigers' designated rebounder, Victor Martinez, managed to rebound three shots and sustained two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strokes since four strokes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," Osmus said.
He showed himself well in (the quality of the batter), noticeably better in the work of the bat and retained this quality for the game.
Having scored three innings in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
Central host Byron Baxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making the bantam, took the first base, and the second baseman Brian Dozier received a strike-out at the stroke of Simon, before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed repulsive Miguel Sano, who scored a two-run "single" to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of early players not in the outfield and a comparative wound at the second base Verhagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to the double-play.
This was the 27th time for a top-tier player this season when Pluff hit the ball on a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned an RBI "dub" into the space between the fielders against the closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three innings in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the injured list before the game itself, missing for more than a month due to back pain.
“It’s definitely not the start I’d like,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I became more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
The two-out by rightfielder J.D. Martinez led out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first inning in the game.
Victor Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez finished his series "0 for 21" with the runners-up in the resultant position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos subsequently made a "single" with another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning by getting a one-out double from James McCann's catcher and a two-out single from central defender Anthony Goose, and that turned out to be 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got right to the point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in a non-scoring third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed reliever A. J. Ahter.
Hughes scored three runs on six hits and a wick with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Pitcher-right "Tigers" An<0xC3><0xAD>bal S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez dropped out of the players due to stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had surgery on Sanchez’s shoulder back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and go against the Twins.
Norris, who has come out with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Pray to God" was received in the South Sakhalin court.
In the South-Sakhalinsk city court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam", reports "Interfax" with reference to the chairman of the court Alexander Chukh.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the trial participants.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to check the sausage for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense,” he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko on the recognition of the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal complaint came from the Prosecutor’s Office of South Sakhalin on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," - said Chukhray.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotations from the Qur'an - "We worship you and ask you for help", "Do not call anyone along with Allah".
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book “shaitans and provocateurs”.
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to legally prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
“I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law according to which it is forbidden to make decisions in court regarding directly the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the leadership of Facebook intends to cooperate with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
So, the day before, the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry, together with specialists of the social network, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove comments that are incorrect in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the deletion of their record.
To facilitate the prompt blocking of illegal content should also be organizations, whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network for offensive posts.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, social media management and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after the German segment of Facebook sharply grew xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that engulfed the countries of the European Union some time ago.
So, in Germany already today, all the points intended for the placement of refugees are overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks, where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In the Moscow cemeteries there will be relaxation zones.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar plots will appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State budget institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small green areas reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to the cemetery will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsk, Butovsk and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest massifs to the maximum possible extent.
The green plantations will serve as a living fence that will divide the recreation areas and the squares allocated directly to the places for burial.
Experts of the GBU "Ritual" also stated their intention to make a proposal to refuse fencing at the graves.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to the cemeteries will be able to learn GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June of this year, the GBU “Ritual” also offered to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in summer time will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
It should be noted that in the last year, the prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
In the forests of Yelnin five days later found a lost mushroom.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a commission.
The discovery of the mountain mushroom was possible thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: “A 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest.”
Without food and water.
He was looked for by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter was connected to the search operation.
On that day, Vitaliy Aleksandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for opiates and subterraneans, but did not return until evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were picked up in search of the mushroom - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, a helicopter of the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
It went very far, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He has come a long way at his age.
The miracle is still alive.
Hrybnik was taken to the central district hospital in Yelnin without consciousness, in an extremely severe condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overcooling of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors have absolutely no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yelnin CIA: "A patient examination, treatment is appointed."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Retired Vitaliy Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to collect mushrooms, but he never went deep into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle not local."
I have been coming to visit my family for a few years now.
Well, I went for the mushrooms.
He must have gone far and gone astray.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to go in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces so that you can then go back.
The An-2 crashed into the fraternal taiga.
On average, an An-2 crashed in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Enisey" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There are no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself sustained significant damage upon landing.
An-2 made an official flight.
There were three crew members on board - the commander, the second pilot and flight engineer, Interfax reports.
The crash plane made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the aircraft has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The fraternal transport prosecutor's office after the crash landing An-2 began to check compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned Tayhag airfield in Komi.
The ship was denied engines and on-board electronics, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the emergency landing of the plane.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel Laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to the reduction of inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the chief scientist of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision-Making of the HSE, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics, Eric Maskin.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more and more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
“And these predictions have come true in many ways,” says Maskin.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so joyful.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the gap between the “rich” and “poor” in poor countries, which manifests itself in a great inequality of income, or rather, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Developing Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the Higher Education Research Institute.
Together with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, reminds the NIE HSE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualification to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have wages rising thanks to cooperation with B-level workers from rich countries, then D-level workers do not feel growth or their wages are falling at all.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
Creamer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It makes it possible to explain why globalization has led to income inequality,” says Fuad Aleskerov, a full professor who heads the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Making, the head of the mathematics department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as noted by the scientist, do not have the means to do so, and companies are not profitable to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of the growth of the GDP of countries.
Derbent: The Living Connection of Time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of the festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of open temples, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and a tour of the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this as if descended from the pages of "The Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Kaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern plateaus, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - monuments of living nature".
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will pour fragrant tea and will be served with Dagestan delicacies - honey, hurm, musk, wonder buns, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, large samovars have been used to drink the tea of numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 A.D. Hijri.
In the year 733, according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: the arcades of domes and arches rest on square columns and are illuminated by rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional passion of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of poultry put pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the attic.
An exciting sight is the take-off into the sky of a flock of white pigeons, similar to the outbreaks of a festive fireworks display.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Leaving for 500 meters in the sea, this building blocked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven back in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - strips of wool, cotton or wool of all colors and shades, with a vortex and without it, with a complex ornament and a whimsical whim.
The construction of the city began with the Magas - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
For many years, the warehouses have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the Middle Ages, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water pipe, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago, are preserved.
To this day, ancient sources have arrived, in which local residents still collect water.
Many Derbents prefer ordinary tap water to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Watering and painting vases, dishes, jars, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the potters are now making wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope, on which students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship dates back several centuries.
A new trend is that among canoeists, girls are increasingly seen.
In the premises of the former Girls' Bath there is today a museum "Culture and Life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here accompanied by friends, and now anyone can see the vaulted dome hall, hot and cold pools, gone into the past accessories for swimming.
Most homes in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular these days as they were in the past.
The benefits of heating the body by steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
In the festival "The Society", which takes place on the territory of the fortress Naryn-Kala, ethnocourts of many regions of Dagestan take part.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowed from time to time sarcophagus are cut out of whole stone blocks and oriented, as is accepted by the Arabs, along the axis of the west-east.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubova cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
The techniques of the circular craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Jacob brothers can make not only the traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town there is a house where the writer-decabrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, the life and life of the citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, communicate with friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of chaihana.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events at the republican and Russian level.
Soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning perfectly the folk Avar, Dargin, Dad, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, local residents sit on benches near houses with terraces.
As a rule, the Derbents discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly remember episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game in the airport".
There is a new form of education in the capital.
Four hundred students have tried themselves as employees of the airport.
For this purpose, models of three aircraft were assembled in Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered the passengers, but also serviced the aircraft.
All this is in the form of a business game, but it was not inferior to reality.
Delayed flights, immediately two passengers with fractures on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The real airport is hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar of Domodedova - a standard set of tasks that have to solve for beginners.
Three large airports from different countries of the world fit into one hangar.
Today, they employ four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
Unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of aviagavani.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, luggage turnover - they were even entrusted with buses on the airfield, stairs and passenger inspection.
Passengers are also problematic.
One had a mess of documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual funds, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amounts for the service of the flight.
"For failure to fulfill the relevant tasks, a fine is imposed on them," - explains in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow" financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of training.
She has already found a place in the knowledge of secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will be, in fact, new models of activity of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment,” says the director of the state policy department in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of Mino.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the evaluations for this exam had quite a material expression.
The latest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them because I responded to the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," - pleased participant of the game, the PR manager of the team "Frankfurt Airport" Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, which is called, took a pencil to invite to work by the time of graduation.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia has expressed regret over the closure of the U.S. Center for Foreign Literature at the Library.
The center has worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which did not break even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," the statement said.
The American Center has created deep and strong ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place for numerous American eminent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Just last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the educational exchange program FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was soon to be put to death.
Typical situation: four officials stand at the table of Judge Swatander Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to cheer you up,” Kumar said.
If one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has been able to consider more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: In less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of the enhanced industrial development, India has turned from a country of virgin jungles into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where the development of infrastructure does not slow down the rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and a few remaining housing estates are being demolished.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the Modi government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the environment minister called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “infeasible”.
Sometimes the court’s decision is indeed impossible to execute within the court’s time limit, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, unexecutable deadlines also have a positive side: at least, they make responsible people move.
“Its main goal is to shake up this system,” the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly canceled large-scale constructions: on its account, the termination of the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people also try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding in ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to a single draft of a judge’s pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite the sharp decline in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatantar Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government to provide statistics on inbound and outbound road transport, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, knowing in advance at the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to come into the court’s attention, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principled judge was the program to clean the Ganges River, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and goes on to scream.
Do you know what the word “holy” means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think Gang is Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The Ganges Cleanup is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Between 1.5 million and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus who swim in it die each year from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga Rescue Fund money from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the suit was bought for $ 700,000, while it takes at least eight billion to clean the river.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be environmental.
“In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as an unacceptable luxury,” says Malika Bhanot, a call-gang activist.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle ground between ecology and development.”

Xi Jinping urges to make the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, a change in the rules of border control, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), attracting private capital and the revision of the system of registration of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more meaningful role in allocating resources, ensuring business legality and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also weaken control over the powers it gives to companies by ensuring that companies conduct their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign financing, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
