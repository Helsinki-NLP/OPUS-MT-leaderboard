Tom's pretty convincing, isn't he?
I miss communicating with them.
He tried not to cry.
They are sympathetic.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
Who told you I did it?

Since I didn’t get an answer, I wrote to her again.
What would you like to say about this?

I wonder if Tom and Mary planned to do that.
I borrowed Tom's car.

Somewhere in this building.
We are open tomorrow.

What time is the end of the world?
I never worry.
How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.
I don't blame him.
Where's your key?
Tonight it will be quite cold.

It looks like Tom.
You don’t have to do that if you don’t want to.
I was just going to wash up.
Tasty!
Did Tom mention any problems?
Where does Tom have to do that?
Mary wants me to be on her team.
No one is listening anymore.
You're brave.
You have to do it yourself.
Which means Tom was right.
I'll sit over there.
Put it down.
Tom was the last one.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Mary ate alone.
You will find them, won't you?
I can't stand the humidity.

Let’s stop this futile discussion.
Tom cleaned the apple.
Tom didn't read the report you wrote.
Did you talk about it with Tom?
No one would help me do that.
You're Italian.
What's she like?
The pocket thief took Mark's passport.
I think you like him.
This magazine costs just <0xC2><0xA3>2 including shipping.
I'll miss you.
I sat down at the counter next to Tom.

Come in tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom knock down the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary assures me.
I wasn't on that bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary did what she had to do.
I was watching Tom.
Did you reserve a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off the mobile, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going on a picnic.
We could not buy tickets for the concert until we received money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
He doesn’t play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need Tom here.
We've run out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place can not learn the pleasure of living in the village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a cola and a French fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
I have a problem with my account.
Tom was happy to agree.
I think Tom is wrong.
You all right?
You may be the only one who can do this.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers blush from shame.
You know Tom's a liar.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!

He was big.

You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.

You are lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how it is done.
You drink?
Tom's gonna do this with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began on the fifth day.
Mary said she likes to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I have only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut off his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Aren't you comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom has repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is this Mary's husband?
He'll find out for himself.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.

When I walked into the room, she was playing the piano.
You are very kind.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom rubbed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn’t want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll eat.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're happy.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There is no pyramid in Europe.
It's almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We should come up with a secret language.
Do you plan to stay a long time?
When do you plan to go to Japan?

What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She could not defend herself.
The following month, Tom leaves Boston.
Careful, it's gonna be hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year, millions of people die of hunger.

I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What's he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just got cut.
Mary said that she had never studied French.
I think I will buy a new car.
We are guilty ourselves.

You have to stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines in the day and the moon at night.
I got up on her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.

I really want to eat.
Tom died the same year as Mary.
We went to the street.

It's very cold.
That's why you came back from Boston, right?
Did Tom believe that?
In fact, he’s never been to New York.
Tom thought that Mary and John might be involved in arms smuggling.
I was sober then.
Here's your surrender.
Tom was waiting for Mary.

I'll wait here until he comes.
Tom knows how to drive.
I read novels by heart.
I was going to tell Tom, but I forgot.
I'm a heroine.

I got up at about six.
I don't want to brag, but I'm pretty smart.
Does it matter?
Can I see you for a minute?
Tom may not even be on the team.
I wonder if I can trust him.
What's wrong with her?
You're drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your teddy bear?
What's up, Tom?
Maybe this year we will finally win the Eurovision Song Contest.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing it for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do it.
What miracle would Tom want to do this?
Birds can see the Earth’s magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning to do it somehow?
Am I expressing myself clearly?
I am free this day.
Tom is probably being punished for what he did.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
No need to hurry.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn’t believe him.
The phone is not working now.
Tom with his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come on in.
Tom can be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really unwise.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he saw John in January.
You always get up early, right?

My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom is already in French.
The earth passed from father to son.
There are no roses without thorns.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Expect a surprise this evening.
You will never be alone.
Why should we not do this?
There is nothing to celebrate.
I like to watch TV.
He left his family.
Let's go.

We were ready.
I am concerned that I may be brought to trial.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
It fell out of my hands.
Tom speaks French very well.
I know I will learn a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Dad, look over there, shark!" "That's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I’m very happy.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom.
The talks went pretty well.
At this time of year, the wind blows from the ocean.
I saw that Tom was smiling.
Heyda, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and kill that bully.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!

In her free time she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings country music better than anyone I've ever known.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at this.
Why did he get fired?
Tom said Mary was gone.
I don’t have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased opinion is that this is a terrible film.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's important.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
She's at Tom's.
Tom was a barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see an error, please correct it.
We tried again, but it didn’t work out.

He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to go up that mountain.
Tom missed lunch.
You speak good English.

Come on, I'm messing with Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I am looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you will come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What kind of theater is this?
Did you see the protein?
Mary said that Tom told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the door slam open.
I don't have time for you.
Mary is a great dancer.
My dad's from Osaka.
I want a massage. I need to relax.
Tom is so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
You managed to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
When do you think Tom will be here?
Will there be snow tonight?
You're having a hard time?
You're meeting someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
He's small.
Did you not know this was going to happen?
Bad thoughts give rise to bad actions.
Did you bring a hairdryer?
Tom is not wrong.
Do you have a pass from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can’t do without water.
I can't keep up with my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never give up.
I speak French fluently.
Tom didn’t waste his time.
Inspire me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom says he’s happy.
How do you feel now?
How many guys in your class?
These are big apples.
Choose a gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need some new tires.
Lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the movie, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We are getting married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the bones.
The book was missing a few pages.
I picked up the coin.
I have to go to a meeting.

We have to protect ourselves.
You know, Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Each student has their own party.

I learned how to feed a cow.
I'm full.
Too bad I'm not rich.
The news made her very sad.
I have a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see for yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
What is your name?
She holds flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man's ninety.
This coffee is so hot I can't drink it.
Where did you get this?
We're done?
You're from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I have your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know Tom told us a lie.
Tom heard that Mary had married.
I learned a lot.
How much does this umbrella cost?

What happened?
This can be done.

I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class was infected with the flu.
Do you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?

There is no toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please, just sit here and wait.
I love this T-shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved out last month.

I'm going to the airport.
Don't pay attention to her whims.
I'm glad that Tom will help us.
Tom will be here for a minute.
I’m glad they’re both on our team.
Where can we sit?
You like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you all right?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He didn't suspect anything.
I invited her on a date.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do it.
I don’t expect them to win.
I'm asleep.
How is that my fault?
As for Switzerland, have you been there in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I am learning Vietnamese language.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan debt.
Try to look at it from the point of view of Tom.
The window opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn’t find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom had a rather painful look when I last saw him.
Is Tom still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from the 9th to the 5th.
Come on, I'll do this with you.

Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom’s door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a mustache.
I have three questions for you.
I've seen Tom several times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please, just move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench in red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French fluently, don't you?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You don't.
Let's go home.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his wedding ring.
I'll make you breakfast.
Tom listened.
Who broke that window?
Your ideas are a bit outdated.
