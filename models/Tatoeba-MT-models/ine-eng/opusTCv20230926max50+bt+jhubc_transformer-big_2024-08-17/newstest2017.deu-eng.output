28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall.
The victim's brother said he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, "At last it went uphill again with him."
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Division of Forensic Medicine said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and investigations are ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Son & Daughter said they were "shocked and devastated by his death".
“We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO said.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of fight.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
“In everything that goes wrong in the world, it was this uncut diamond that glowed brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD’s hotline at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
“I’m always put in drawers or get stickers from outside that have little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t have the desire to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, I'm more into these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose dut and Mexican food, says the magazine.
She brings up the question of the desire for children: “We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, they chased home to the fodder troughs in a quick gallop.
A mile at this rate, I was afraid.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.
He and his family were guided through the ALRV system, and he didn’t even hesitate to photograph himself on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the Queen of the United Kingdom has raised him.
Langer is the 18th prizewinner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.
And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockem<0xC3><0xB6>hle and the posthum Handum.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade deal – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump claims.
He will drive back regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks, it has opportunities for the disadvantaged and it needs money.
That’s why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost the same thing.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.
There could be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the United States.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris Agreement on climate protection.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with her investment program, calling for “a country to become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
"It's probably going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
The TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want both to sign.
At the same time, they do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – they just want to protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, for example, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says he must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the burden on the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics insist that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, there is Clinton, who wants at least to demand that the rich pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: “Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence”
Sexual violence belongs to women who run away on their own, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the area manager of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized housing for single refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” Bahr says.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a source of hope,” she says.
For women, other reasons for escape are predominant: “Many steal from them secretly because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, coercion, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the run, this continues.
“That tugs, for example, demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often seen as inferior and at worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often did not know how to help themselves, they needed more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked if they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Also in Swabia, refugee women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or private houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the committee said: “It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately.”
"If privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be - more persistent - violence against women".
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen in the address given on the house in Munich.
“Since it has been said that we exist, we have a long waiting list,” says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new work-fighting measures
The assistant doctors' deputies have called on their union to approve new labour measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire council to approve more labor-fighting measures starting in early September.
The JDC said it had failed to address the concerns about the contract.
Physicians and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "sustainably calm" on issues that led to the deal being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for official renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labor struggles beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings, which were still taking place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-skinned and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "Dear Friend" Putin - according to a report as many as five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained cooling emanating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia.
The crime was even greater, as it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting only took place because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d’état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard – especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back in.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: “Tourists there long, tomatoes here long.”
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition, there is the persistent resentment about the snail pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to represent, as one analyst once described to me, an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that are repelled by the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for utter disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised head office and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand our employees will be employed under as we become more of a bank of brands now."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to evolve into a bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?”
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I’m very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori takes the cheer when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori Celebrated the Milestone with a Typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement, the Kremlin said Putin had "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration" without giving any reasons.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website states (in Russian) that he was later the chief of protocol and chief of staff of government personnel.
On his appointment, he said to Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has left Moscow shrouded in mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at his own request.
But despite smiling for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows at the moment.
But the official claim – that a man once lauded as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once – met with great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated posts – one could almost say – difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB state security service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term would have violated Putin’s constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before announcing his resignation.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibson from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, will be released later, according to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have spent the last 12 years putting all my heart into it," Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans who can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is set for September 28.
Mysteries of fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandal, which was spied out by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blowers", which approach completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slant ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the total decks are in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete casting for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the Nordturmdeck, which is under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a gradient of about 3%.
Heikel, as the tolerances the team worked towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck an alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat continued to move on its own.
“We saw the boat spinning around in their vicinity and imagined the worst,” said Moelfre rescue station manager Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of range until we let the water in," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal lifeboat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, this was released when the boat was tilted from the person who was controlling the boat.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Severely injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured her.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic man cut off the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend’s clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted her sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she could not get him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her life partner.
On the way, they met the man’s ex-girlfriend.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that in the future, investors should be given much more responsibility.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD is proposing a "Residence Action Concept" for the next Council meeting.
Disputes are programmed.
First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There is no regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also arise in stock.
According to Bratmann, however, the big point of contention in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social housing.”
A new urban housing support program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tougher rules for investors.
Despite this, according to Bratmann, a tightening of the situation in the housing market is on the way.
If the action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another around 1300 cheap apartments, the promotion of which will expire in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm, out-of-bounds bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about bringing apartments back into the price bracket.
This is possible in the western city.
At one point, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies do not want this.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, you are away from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social infirmities in only a few parts of the city should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join the boat."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is all about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The screen time was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped somewhat before the game was released in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “captured”.
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped in search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked training 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data to boost performance.
Many public health education campaigns that make people want to “take 30 minutes to get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have come across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are also grim game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will slow down over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamically on the jump horse.
Easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the swing beam during the women's singles final in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth straight American to win a multi-fight title and the fifth overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championships – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s singles championship finals in the Art Tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation point at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning for the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of her ground practice – which includes her typical tumbling pass – is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, she became a force.
She has not lost a multi-fight competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceiving.
Swing bars and floor turns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - were waiting.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as she waited for her final destination—a pure formality—and tears flowed down Biles’s shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collector’s book became reality.
Raisman’s performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police shoot 3 victims in serial murder case while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't make it.
I can't do this.
That's what I didn't get into.
Which is not true at all -- of course you've got yourself into it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
“My first response to that was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing that,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he is still unable to speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and ride a bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund came up with for "Please sing something for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs on his own.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don’t expect it to be able to really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected on Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance to affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across much of southern Louisiana through Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was put in place on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will only flow slowly into the Lake Maurepas over the stepped rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still pulling people out of the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said another step-son, who lives nearby, had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed in,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency responders had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continued and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the ground had been considerably flooded by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and street flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school dropouts in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa 200 reported flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been washed away by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to recede, they will be able to return to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to carry, hoping to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” Lacy Landrum of the city administration said.
This appears to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, "holed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot this week.
The boy’s grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents stated that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the thigh, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether they may be among the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles, which were traced to various assault rifles, oversaw the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the footpath, were sleeves.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video, according to reports.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine under the women’s Olympic team in the gym for more than one reason.
First, I’ve been in every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female tournament runner has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and cheered America.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold at an individual women’s multi-fight event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We’re experiencing the pinnacle of this sport, but that’s not what gym classes look like all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four female athletes in the team. Besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily held in private gymnasiums maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started training.
We need to make it possible for the communities, even countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn from and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in the gym, and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for getting her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their path to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was in a “no man’s land” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee on Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assistant physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current employment crisis and neglect to treat all physicians fairly.”
At just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time runs out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks met with the government’s reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening silence.
This came from a promise Jeremy Hunt made just last month that his door would always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the coercion and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
If he does not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist doctors were included to provide coverage to doctors on the strike mail chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve nothing of the few, but burden overburdened teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only for worry, distress and disruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Assistant Physicians Committee and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training sessions, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and the gender pay gap in health care - would be beneficial.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2-per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-per day drug after authorities have recommended that it be given to more people for an extended period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulatory agency has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulatory agency has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form deposits.
When the lining breaks, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE’s draft guideline, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
The fear of having another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guideline does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
A Culture of Political Correctness Brings Election Fraud to the Muslim World
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the grounds of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud being knowingly ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “sensitivities to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lockdowns outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an identity card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to prevent election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes along with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices from his office.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have “led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him.”
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
In particular, he expressed alarm about fraudulent letter voting - where older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping ID cards to prove identity
The report states: “It has been established as evidence that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that ... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop “electors.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger as soon as they have cast their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Carry out systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limitation on applications for automatic letter selection.
Prohibits political activists from editing complete ballots and envelopes of ballots.
The police are given the power to set up polling stations.
An amendment to the Act that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography bans at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds of sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilt.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the city halls.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning sign.
As the mother of parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler-Doppelg<0xC3><0xA4>nger and other famous Olympian doppelg<0xC3><0xA4>ngers in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have this week come to terms with the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doppelganger to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-struggling athlete to have her own famous doppelganger this summer — at least not if you’re allowed to believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the US archery team Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s doppelganger on the bike race track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison has caused an uproar on Twitter after images of him looking uncannyly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star surfaced.
In fact, the archer got the insanity on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
“I myself don’t see much similarity, except for facial hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be even more in focus this year: the striking similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been certified by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medallist in the tournament Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “went off like a mief” and “died like a pig” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl lost the lead, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, where many spoke to him
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unluckily chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who responded to the comment via Twitter
Scott Russel apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and posted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show and our followers on social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron’s comments related to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unluckyly chosen formulation. Byron does what he has said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention for it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swimming season at the CBC Olympic broadcast,” he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry."
Buyer in Primark infuriated by woman who tries shamelessly on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try on underpants.
To make matters worse, she sampled what she looked like in it, pulled it out, and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and try on four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, England.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants from the display, pulled out her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared as she pulled out the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressed up and went out.
“She didn’t seem to bother watching anyone — or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried.”
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that another person was wearing and that was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “As I’ve come to realize, employees have been trying to pull the clothes off the sale after she left — which is just as good.”
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the spit for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, then you should first turn around so you can see your attacker and “get out of the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the bar and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends down in pain. Hit him with the run in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
Simultaneously shift the weight onto the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and point the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi looks like.
But remember that in the event of a robbery it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shaves his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and cholera reflex to a serious examination – by exposing some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, carved his train on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before peeling off each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he’s going to indulge in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink of a drawer toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he left behind left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing toilets, the task definitely put his immune system to the test.
As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and muddy water.
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample blot showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after its luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “This comes close to the worst thing I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.”
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me put it this way – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve put some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed associated in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroys Social Housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social housing after a <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 decampment for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their Saltash, Cornwall property after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed opening holes, wooden partitions were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment will no longer be repaired.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don’t have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, fighting, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an anti-social behavior order in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage was found
It was in the property where drugs were traded in the past that wooden partitions were torn up.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogated her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't make fun of anybody."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're gone, it's going to be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors to watch.
I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and members of the community have done who have bravely approached us and given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor
Home office workers will now have to clear the garbage heaps surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delogate tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogation was a clear warning to other tenants who do not comply with house rules.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-condemnation, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force landed an incredible crash flight
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It really flew by twice very deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was going to fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility conditions, the jet flew slightly lower than usual due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was never compromised at any time.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his sight.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona will fight for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, the return match rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to do without Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, among others, with the inferior cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
During the training, the German suffered a knee-deep ligament, which cleared the entry question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the status of number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has given up on a clear decision in this regard so far and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really know how to convince even at the 3:2 rehearsal run against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, in turn, have to digest the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strive for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in her own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4-0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the world-ranked first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed as expected in the final game and made the title apart.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was former SVS N<0xC3><0x96> legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and timeouts they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés run into each other in fair competition.
"I've played the matches so far for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang had said.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were not enough stunning ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinal against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to settle "finally" with sheet metal.
By the way, Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and J<0xC3><0xB6>rgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia-Fourth at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump Admits ‘Strong Problems’ in Election Campaign
The U.S. Republican leadership is plagued by massive concerns that it will lose its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals inside his own Republican camp out of the race, doubts are growing about his success in the fight for the White House.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in major states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilty of false reports about his candidacy, he re-recorded his well-known media slurs.
Whispering Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wants to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just like I’ve done so far.”
“This will either be successful, or I will have a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing more than “telling the truth.”
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to withhold funds to support its election campaign should it not be able to present better poll values.
Instead, the Republicans’ candidates for Congress are more likely to fall into line.
Olympia: Dreister fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya’s athletes are facing a second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics.
Kenya has sent a trainer home after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to the Kenyan team management by the doping inspectors.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent IOC action, the IAAF will conduct an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," said Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete’s accreditation, which was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich became the fourth-place finisher of the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed his country’s athletes about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special surveillance at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
When announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping controls prior to the Rio Games, it was noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country’s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly alleged that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a substantial mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya into how he had employed them in Russian athletics.
In doing so, it was possible to prove that this sport was doped comprehensively and systematically.
Russia’s athletes were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra grave, the Sim<0xC3><0xB3>n Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he groans.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an elderly Maria.
She remembers her love for Tony with anguish, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she is musically extraordinary.
And then there would be Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it’s his life!
It is such a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same subjects, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good thing about it is — as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone — to keep people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay with Garland as Supreme Court nominee in case of election victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, being lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because "playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
“We must return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person on open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community counts on mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len-based Foundation for Dialogue and the World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "hundreds of thousands", believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the tough action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, of several hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Ali Toprak, the head of the association, told the "World" on Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds inside Turkey were on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure to leave the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the federation demanded that the federal government position itself "as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
There is also a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
For the first time in months, I don’t feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
Branding as a G<0xC3><0xBC>len supporter destroys teachers and other academics’ professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the G<0xC3><0xBC>len-based Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World."
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany even before the coup.
As of 30 June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-seekers (39,625).
In this survey, there are no survivors of war, poverty or hopelessness.
Persons entitled to asylum under the Basic Law are exclusively politically, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the parliamentary elections will not be held again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it’s not as stupid as it used to be: summer holidays, heat and the country’s election campaign – that bites.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling to Usedom, R<0xC3><0xBC>gen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: in the holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes, just hard to pick up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign pass by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be interesting to see how much Neuling AfD cuts off and what is left at the end of what is fit for the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you see from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary talkative predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD’s flourishing.
Her refugee policy, her “We Can Do This” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently complained in the GDR.
But it is also not a bad thing for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it is breaking the ground in the country, that it has to make a great effort to find a way back to the people.
You go like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU voter Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-explanatory: "They have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday crisis and move their election campaign to the Internet for the most part.
"Online election campaign", calls it the country's president Claudia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of traces of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently curving around the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also finds it beautiful.
Their impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 Renovation: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed at which the B 27 is being revamped, there is nothing to complain about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 in the morning and ends only at 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tricky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time as planned, until the end of October everything is to be finished.
The reception of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief entrances, is also praised.
Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Ofterdingen was also lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There have been some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy chief of staff responsible for the redevelopment's traffic management.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Steinlachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Hafnerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because they were looking for many slippery roads and were more familiar with their navigation than the signage.
As a result, some trucks broke down in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from M<0xC3><0xB6>ssingen.
“There were significant overshoots,” says King, who once informed himself of the situation on the spot.
Two to three flashes per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was at 77 km/h in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27-recovery has led to a drop in sales in them lets anyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, have little consequences for the renovation.
At Autohaus Maier, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "very slight decline", but also admits that, of course, "the running customer is missing".
The most crowded are the bars along the street.
J. Albert G<0xC3><0xB6>hner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had it "hard hit".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
He said the loss in sales was “more than 50 percent.”
The redevelopment of the road has "rejected its operation by two years".
Half of his employees had to be fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt responded to a question from G<0xC3><0xB6>hner on whether there could be a financial compensation, noting that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27.
G<0xC3><0xB6>hner knows of other counties where something more generous was handled.
With all the complaints, G<0xC3><0xB6>hner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now passing by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive, it's beautiful elsewhere.
G<0xC3><0xB6>hner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the end of the renovation works.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, G<0xC3><0xB6>hner considers the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being screwed up in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a status of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
You are not exaggerating anyone.
Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was interested in results and in an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach, De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had some time left before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
However, they are now all the more extensive.
Something is already known, announced, pointed out: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re is launching a second call for proposals that had nothing to do with the SPD so far: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and button down jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
Some new ideas de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also presents.
They have it partly in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more ways to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should first have their smartphones checked and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
In the case of asylum-seekers who are rejected, he wants to make some worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them are still unsolved and leave questions open.
And on some points - on the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re says, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people could not be excluded even during election campaigns.
Internal security has been very much in focus.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are electoral battles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been an upsurge between the two parties.
First a bitter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of departments also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re also strives here for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't stop at a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Re-opening it is pointless.
And in the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutionally binding on all corners and whether it is indeed "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signalled a cautious willingness to talk and said: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still going strong.
Despite the diesel scandal, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
However, it is not all around in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest carmaker can still show a plus in the course of the previous year despite the diesel deal thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July, 1.8 percent less than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year’s month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries decreased by almost a sixth.
Head of brand sales J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Stackmann reported the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a restraint on purchases due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also been burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the emissions trade first escalated, there is also a downside.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
All in all, the mainly affected house brand in Lower Saxony is still illustrious due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a 0.9 percent drop in deliveries to 3.37 million vehicles is on the books.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this time, with 5,904 million vehicles worldwide.
Volkswagen had tampered with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issues the customer with a "guarantee equal" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
This is due to legal inconsistencies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting took place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility, for example, that customers will come to a workshop with an engine damage for about half a year after the conversion - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid, in the interest of the customer, that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, causes uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding future penalty interest from wealthy savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their large-scale penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
Starting in September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will charge this fee to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros in Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for quite some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
“They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4% of costs,” the bank manager said.
"I can't lay down for every million 4,000 euros."
The costs are now passed on according to the causation principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the Raiffeisen Bank’s vaults would be far too dangerous: “I’ve already experienced four robberies, I don’t like the fifth one!”, the bank manager said.
Most customers had an understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few moved to other banks.
The cooperative association Bayern stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
Wearing them alone is "permanently not possible in business".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits starting from three million euros, the Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, CEO of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay large-scale fees for deposits, for this the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong."
One banker said that on Lake Tegernsee there is "a clientele that is equipped with wealth a little more lavishly".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they guard free money.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
"At present, no other banks are known to the cooperative association Bayern, which calculates an allowance for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in general.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to soak it under the pseudonym NotAllIndividualMenMiddle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about resurgence of records isn’t about a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but about midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobbyists – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and stomp wildly before I stop, hold my hands, and say something defining like, “Well, let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers once lived - there are still a handful of fantastic specialty record stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home), decorate the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn’t afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, that came out when I was 11 or 12, things where I was probably a little too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves buying their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually disposed of their collection in this way around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom to fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took the initiative on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy memories of youth.
“I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort,” Wez says.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a worker floats out of a pile of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scrolled through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works on Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophic aspect" of the revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-laden, less music-laden.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are just slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience as I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a bit less relaxed than in the stores mentioned above – Wild Beast’s latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop is buzzing out of the speakers instead of experimental jazz – it’s good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to spot when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.
She's more of a shop window hustler than a big shopping spree.
She doesn’t deserve much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to hear music from a computer or some other way, but the beauty of records is...” she drives off with a suffocating lover.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While giving the appearance of sampling the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But given that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like records.
Even though my research found that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and leafing through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake presenter who asks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - Video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was set by a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer of demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional stores in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in a restaurant provisor.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people carrying out the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is run for public benefit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as counseling on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L’Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people – the highest number to date – after a steep increase in newcomers over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic Disappointment: Martin Remains Combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I will continue to keep my eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday ahead of his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"To be honest, I find it difficult to comment on yesterday's timing," Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze what reasons would have led to the debacle.
At the World Championships in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed recently.”
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund's win ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The World Rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
The winner, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her stroke once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hopeful Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the Briton Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last been there in 1992.
There has never been a German duo in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group increases in start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not say on Thursday.
Beam only launched in January with its offer and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies, as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s parent Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer.
Germany’s racers have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer speedometers particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers of the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident hotspots where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary lightning bolt.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or cumbersome.
The enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the advanced state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered during measurement operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, incidentally, also fireproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flasher from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently reordered 100 units, following an order of 150 units last year.
UK to win silver in 7th Rugby after Fiji masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7th Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday night at the last hurdle in Fiji’s form when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backstroke, line running and raw power to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boxing, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
This slip will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully and made the attacks of GBs burst out of fun.
The World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau cornered Osea Kolinisau to the top of the table, making the team feel like they were running in buses.
With four minutes left in the game, Jerry Tuwai added another right-hand attack, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An excellent tackle from Mitchell stopped Man Leone Nakarawa’s mountain to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua flew a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion led to a 29-0 break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental half-time changes and closed the Fijian gap...for as many as four minutes, which was good for the first half conditions, until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-dish with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked devastatingly into the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from the English 15-Aside team, secured the win – and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row victory by battling with coach’s cancer
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first row to the last, 220 hard lifts that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th undefeated effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive that day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that can be operated on, and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start their treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station – 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who served as the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.
We didn’t want a fireworks display today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a year off before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years, exemplary clarity has been ensured
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago it was called in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered "to be exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all of this is Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, who has been an employee for 31 years in the association, 28 of whom have been managing directors.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, annually promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud B<0xC3><0xBC>hl (FW), recalled that Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller was hired as a water warden in 1985 and was appointed as the managing director of the association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions, and emergency operations on weekends," she said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the repurchasing of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipes.
There has been no downtime and there has been constant innovation because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised G<0xC3><0xB6>ller’s faithful, reliable, and correct service over 31 years.
He has devoted a lot of heart to his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a lot of praise and recognition for this.
Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller, for his part, praised water warden Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterman and he was a loyal boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the breaking of the pipe at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work through the night so that the villages can be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only have been maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel St<0xC3><0xBC>rmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert G<0xC3><0xB6>ller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly talks about her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized in her son, she believed that she must die.
But now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that's two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - Man shoots life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) at around 10.45 am on Friday and fatally injured her.
“The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his life partner,” a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after which he will be publicly hunted.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have released a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a scarf.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a “relationship state.”
The victim is born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in L<0xC3><0xBC>beck initially did not want to make any information about the act or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We're not saying anything more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a Special Operations Command (SEK) at the scene.
Steel - View of light for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from the promotion of green power are off the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy surcharge on the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve that.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, for cash.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry faced additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principled agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent apply.
But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-generation.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"In terms of our 'Steel is the Future' campaign, this is a first step."
"Others must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chef J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further as China, the world’s largest producer country, poured massive amounts of steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
This spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imported steel show an effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime minister Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lately, prices have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closings of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association of Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year’s figure.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing does seniors good
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's office study she took up the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy, and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To be able to talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive way, Hackler says.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of their breath as quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of the Seniors’ Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher importance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, to focus on one’s own voice and on a predetermined rhythm, while adapting to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people, who live alone, thus practice not only focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are many good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes by?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to the cries of young animals
Biologists have studied in Hannover what effect the call of cat babies has on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold either - however, unlike the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the arousal level of cat babies at the miauen of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
“Obviously, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly excited juveniles are either not perceptible or not significant for the males,” said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of kitten cries differed from the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were pre-played by little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample size.
“All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams,” Konerding said.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call of the much more excited kittens played out.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC3><0xBC>r is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC3><0xBC>r.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski’s Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: “Business as usual” is said.
Already at the imposition of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July, the government announced that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
There is also no stopping before football.
Against the former starkicker Hakan S<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC3><0xBC>r, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
According to this, the now-living sucre in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
S<0xC3><0xBC>k<0xC3><0xBC>r is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact, it has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nighttime "democracy watch" in public places across the country has declared Erdogan to be over on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas workers' club traditionally do not belong to the friends of the president.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
The winner of the cup "Gala" will be Lukas Podolski again.
The 31-year-old ended his first season as the club’s top scorer with 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in a great way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a conciliatory conclusion for the record champion.
After the preliminary round in the Champions League, the "lions" also left early in the Europa League.
In the S<0xC3><0xBC>per Lig it only reached the rank of six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win anything.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year of play was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 seasons as Super Lig Goalkeeper King laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who is under contract at AC Florence and has only been loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM holiday due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said club manager Fikret Orman.
But the striker would have to be willing to forgo about a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Chances at Rio Olympics
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio nicht.
Other transferred athletics offenders can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had sued her right to start after a doping ban shortly before the games, was mercilessly teased and exploited at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a funny scene: with a smile on her face, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked with her performance.
When it was established that she would not fetch gold, the audience burst into a jubilation storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past, go to the Olympics in Rio for the start.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion has run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympian and seven-time World Champion had to sit down for a six-month ban in 2010 after she was shown to have taken the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (discussions/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, the world champion of 2013 and the European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the drug and was banned for six months.
This year’s four largest throws will go to the account of the big gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
For example, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title because of testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics by the International Court of Justice (CAS).
At 80.04 m, he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May, but still allowed to start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, indications of the intake of a banned food supplement were found, the ban of the world anti-doping agency WADA fell out mildly and expired already on July 13.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schn<0xC3><0xB6>ll said on Friday.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She planned to return home at the beginning of September.
Whether further explosions on the resort island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affecting Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, Schn<0xC3><0xB6>ll said.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in an out-of-town neighborhood on Thursday night.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
In the early hours of Friday, two sets of bombs went up again, killing another person, according to authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb went off in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police district.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several wounded.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
"We believe this is a coordinated attack."
It's too early to comment on possible motives - but it's probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Authorities have received intelligence reports of imminent attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they have not been informed of the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police have instructed officials across the country to strengthen security around key government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they usually do not target tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bombings, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends following the instructions of the Thai security authorities on its homepage.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moved towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military council, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, considers itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get hold of the Muslim insurgency that has been raging in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Just over a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine – most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "identitarian movement" has come to the fore of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'identitarian movement' indications of efforts against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en, head of constitutional protection at the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
She opposes “multi-cultural insanity”, “uncontrolled mass migration” and the “loss of one’s identity through alienation”.
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said his authority had agreed closely with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to get their target group where it stands," he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-appropriate language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists do.
This is not a shabby advertisement for your own cause.
Propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Maa<0xC3><0x9F>en said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party – in this case the AfD – by certain people who are extremist, changes their direction of aim and thus becomes extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognisable.
In view of the marked increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maassen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Gruppe.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Mea<0xC3><0x9F>en expressed concern that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's what's worrying.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, have elected CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized through right-wing extremist sentiments."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hit
The Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his run with a 48-second gap and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not-so-sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the International Swimming Federation.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the "Robel of the Whale".
In reference to a "well-being belly", the English boulevard paper "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Moussambani was fired frantically at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neues Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business at about 5.30 pm on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending election defeat as close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If the U.S. presidential election doesn’t work out, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he would be relatively unconcerned: "Ultimately it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with U.S. television station CNBC.
“If it’s not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine,” Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously high.
The Post also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
Soon the group will start trading with the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
“We want to go into third-party sales,” a post-speaker said on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and parcels, to other companies as well.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Gerdes, the post-advisor, had said that there were always demands, for example, from craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group intends to enter mass production of the vehicles in the near future.
In post-owned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aimed at a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're going to turn the entire fleet around.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly – but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK hinted that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the global number five in the industry is facing a personnel restart.
GfK’s CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board of GfK Arno Mahlert has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the board of directors will take over the previous member of the board Gerhard Hausruckinger as early as September 1, the company said.
He is to officially assume the role of a "Board Speaker" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company called "different views" on the long-term orientation of business policy.
A company spokesman declined to say any details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear at the moment.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed with the continued failure of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
“The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years,” it said.
In the face of the recent poor GfK business numbers, every shareholder will at some point become restless.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the pre-quarters.
At <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the previous year’s comparable quarter.
In the first half of the year, sales fell by 3.4 per cent to EUR 721.2 million.
Profits in the second quarter were mainly affected by the company’s declining value due to its difficult economic situation.
The EUR 139 million impairment losses that became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area resulted in a loss of EUR 148.2 million for the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rn in Graben: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident on Thursday in Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rn (district Aurich) on a coach with 43 seniors as passengers.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an incoming truck, which was partly on the opposite side of the road.
The bus came off the road to the right and slipped into a ditch, according to a police spokeswoman, Aurich/Wittmund.
“Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own,” she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and a ambulance arrived at the accident site on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back to the Pewsum district of Krummh<0xC3><0xB6>rner by a bus.
There, they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant area as of 1 October 2016 instead of 2.10 euros; 3.36 euros for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp (previously 2.26 euros) and 3.64 euros for Azendorf (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After a superfluous calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4,37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that there are sub-coverages for these wastewater plants.
Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their pockets.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-covers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases by saying that all three wastewater treatment plants were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water catchment, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the amount of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the last calculation period, major renovation and repair costs were incurred for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the almost 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch and at the pond-clearing plant Lopp, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to be able to maintain the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the advanced maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user made it clear that in the case of the small amount of wastewater in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance "fully outweigh".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared large maintenance costs at the wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In Steinh<0xC3><0xA4>user’s view, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the area of supply of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); and health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it’s insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that is already bordering on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All the missteps go to the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "injurious and, frankly, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling blocks.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urging others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but aren’t in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything against it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, establishes congressional committee
U.S. Central Command military personnel altered intelligence to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News service information typically nicked by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analyses by other news services,” the report said.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in Centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi Armed Forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to paint a more optimistic picture of the Islamic State threat, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they corresponded to the facts,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, so much is clear,” Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command’s top officials changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will be supplemented by more detailed findings as investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the Republican Task Force’s conclusions.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives committee.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “delayed the publication of intelligence reports,” damaged morale among analysts, and “gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which were recorded after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigations are still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful U.S.-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of intelligence about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq, and little time was devoted to the thought of reviving it.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-held refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth women's field hockey match, a showdown with Britain looms
One day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever having done that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their doors in mind.
She knows this, however: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each get first and second place.
The first-place finisher will go a little longer out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday’s game, the Americans have unleashed a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after landing in the last of 12 places at the previous London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at age three (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at age 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and thus things began to turn for the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely tear the rudder down.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and ran the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to record a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a race between competition and striving.
It’s as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, ranging from a crossbowman to a swimmer to a gymnast to a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is in the Olympics for the first time and is a female swarm with dimples, could certainly have been among those well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, Turner or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the chest swimming and may it prevail for a long time.
But if I modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely over the last 16 years that many of those I interviewed didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who managed to make it to the final round.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
China’s Dong Dong and Canada’s Rosie MacLennan will defend their London gold medal this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, in part because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I’m not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential – the cartoonish shaking of its never-ending impact – but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "jump board."
Upcoming winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air, and have to make a series of falling moves (turns, pike, and jumps) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls need to move on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but they are also chasing another ridiculous goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I find tiring when I watch these games myself.
The trampoline offers a breath of fresh air.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaulting into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s rounds on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2 p.m.
Amid the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If awareness-raising can only be achieved through the targeting and objectification of male athletes – as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal – then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base struggling for air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia were met with violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfights.
Is Ethiopia collapsing right now?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political change.
The government’s response was, according to human rights organizations, unmerciful.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters in the area.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are believed to be from last year or early this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights agency is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia, with only a few countries in Africa, if any, receiving so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led the government’s repression – the opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed, or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this zany, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, who have been more or less subdued in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians said they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, thrived in politics and business while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that is also changing right now.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, were apparently tainted by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal displeasure.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigrays is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge hike."
Donald Trump claims Obama founded ISIS as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the latest controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group had not been taken seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow combatants, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the suggestion at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump squirmed back about Thursday’s claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know anything about it.
The latest storm of criticism is plunging down on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared “Of course I meant that sarcasticly.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods of testing how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, “clarifying” depending on how the reaction turns out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of softening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more tantalizing tone as his poll values have declined further.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he has been increasingly the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s prank has put his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying are legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backers, completely wrong and because it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on every word of his and being biased against him.
He mocked the “poor, miserable” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t do it!”
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once the price is pushed out of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby coffee shop in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices pushed him out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it is also a reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a client offered to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept up a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
“Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no qualms about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was destroyed on the floor when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a flair for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water tortoise soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman in her book, “97 Orchard,” talks about living in a Lower East Side apartment building from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be published Tuesday in Harper’s Books, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, laceless snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hack roasts, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something inexpensive that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" outlines the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles became staple foods, the casseroles as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique blends have been tried out because a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even common sense.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition at lunchtime,” Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943—driven the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and meet the challenge of turning pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essential attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most heartbreakingly prepared."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country came back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she could not throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "They actually made people sick."
Then there was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss a fancy name for modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe picked up a check three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, “A few chopped walnuts would help.”
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others’ lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people so far.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the Civil Guard showing him during an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house in 2014 went around the world.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horrors of war.
However, as a hero, he never saw himself, said according to the image: "For me, this is the real Jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffering from respiratory distress.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the image quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims at a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks do not get offspring until they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims gently along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it does, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
This slow-paced lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" anyway of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which is a world record for vertebrates.
Indeed, the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone-aged.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the icy lake off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their leisurely pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the icy lake and looking for cadavers that swirl down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishers caught from Greenland or Spitsbergen between 2010 and 2013 as a by-catch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lynx cores of the sharks.
This center of the lens of the eye is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, however, the lentil core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking shark at 502 centimetres is likely to be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks can obviously be propagated for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methusalems live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale whose bacon had a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck on its neck, was also captured outside Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organisms of the animals living there often run on arson.
They mature later and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Building plot in double pack
During the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues related to construction.
With relief, the board took note of Mayor Robert Putz’s announcement that “finally the marketing of newly designated residential building sites can begin.”
After the land, parcelling and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying, there is nothing more in the way of selling the land in the residential areas "Stra<0xC3><0x9F>lweg" and "Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nau-West" (Binderstra<0xC3><0x9F>e area - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building sites in the rural and quiet residential community of Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nau appeal to young families and well-equipped senior citizens alike.
As it was said, construction workers can immediately report to the City Hall, about the allocation of the plots, the municipal council is expected to consult in its September session.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which was newly drawn up in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards Staatsstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder, head of the IW’s competence field of financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to operate from London out of financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, it is enough for them to be approved in the UK.
Large U.S. banks are using it.
Several banks have already announced plans to move jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the Risk Board of the ESRB, speaks.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, but it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor,” says IW-Professor Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, but, like Dublin, it is worse off in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scored with readily available commercial properties.
“It’s not so easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris,” says Voigtl<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg is ranked 19th, Dublin is ranked 33rd and Paris is ranked 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to the economic researchers.
In London, according to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead Receives Legal Costs from Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
A U.S. District Judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal costs it incurred in the hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of a $200 million damages payment for the infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including Meineides and other unethical actions.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to award the costs incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of lab work that was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city following the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently carrying out clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, giving the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State gave a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster Publishing for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have published their tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retractors regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“You’re on the train,” Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic presidential candidate’s release.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business assets, and various other ties, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already jumped on the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republicans urge Trump to release his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday as saying that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
During an election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to attend a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS, and Trump was “fearful” of voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they received only $100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton’s dividends and revenues of $109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to keep elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements – they throw condoms at them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, along with the U.S. Nature Conservation, has stepped up its advocacy by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we’ve developed the ... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in their attitudes within these communities, and they’re much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming the elephant,” said Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it ignites, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A breath quite usually already out to chase away the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kiosk construction on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goar’s investment projects are undertaken by businessmen with a kiss hand – but it is precisely the retail trade in the core city that is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU group.
Jewish director destroys Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media frenzy after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix because it “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the prefix be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted as saying.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in this very hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurf<0xC3><0xBC>rstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all the accusations and called the incident a "failure" and "excused" Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a direct instruction not to include Israel in the shortlist," the South German newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti sprayed on walls against interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protests came a few days after protesters took to the streets in droves to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to dismiss her.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The upswing in trade has been achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign office issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Drink market attacked in Waldbr<0xC3><0xB6>l
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the Rewe XXL beverage market at Waldbr<0xC3><0xB6>ler Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
In the presence of a firearm, three dark-clad people, who had disguised their faces, demanded from the employee of the beverage market the release of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was seized, the police do not share.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible and poorly visible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market.
After the attack, the offenders must run towards Gerberstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flee from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the robbery (around 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery should report to the police as a matter of urgency.
Nagold: Game and fun in summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational group / social group work of the Child Protection Federation Nagold with their supervisors during their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near M<0xC3><0xBC>hlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtw<0xC3><0xA4>ldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at Lake Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and board.
Culinary delights included children and caregivers with their own prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Sp<0xC3><0xA4>tzle, the Seebronner Pf<0xC3><0xA4>nnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and T<0xC3><0xBC>bingen Bolognese.
In workshops were baked, beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims at the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages have been completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in an estimated two years, the Superior Council of Ministers of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the Bishop’s City of Freiburg was finally chosen, where a special pilgrim destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the door of Mercy opened at Freiburger M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms set out.
The night before, parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrim blessings.
From Horb, we took a train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a M<0xC3><0xBC>nster of Our Lady and thus the pilgrimage route was started by the M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening each by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.
But even on the way, the minis would stop at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim love booklet.
For the overnight stays, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage goals Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
Then on the second day we went via Furtwangen to G<0xC3><0xBC>tenbach.
The next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, had to first descend about 500 meters of altitude and then climb again.
The well-deserved reward was a joint barbecue in the evening at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The minis arrived at the Freiburger M<0xC3><0xBC>nster later in the afternoon, feeling relieved and happy, and walked through the door of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked.
At the evening fair in M<0xC3><0xBC>nster, the minis arrived at the pilgrim’s destination by co-operator Markus Obert were welcomed.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back by train to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home as Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner rallied last night in the men’s team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on, making the legend proud as he stormed home to take home a victory from the New Zealand favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London World Rail Championships in March despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when the hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later retracted this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the grandstand."
We have been together as a team for the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win the Olympics again.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that’s a barometer of our progress over the past five months, that’s what awaits us for a successful five days in the velodrome.
With Kenny’s form, it’s in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go on for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will surely be in focus.
He had been arguing with officials before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced to a world record time of 4:13,260 in the corresponding women’s competition, which will continue and end tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season of the Olympics and fetch a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of big names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of the Portland Melting Plant Due to the Abolition of the Energy Contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – is at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, the energy company said.
This step followed the decision of the Government of Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the facility.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa’s Portland facility are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melting Plant, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea Power Plant.
The Alcoa meltdown in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the facility, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the facility.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects that the facility will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts are so-called "security deals" that should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impacts on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million annual financial statement in “expected termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect Alcoa's "ability to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November of this year, even though it is still guilty of a statement as to why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland Melting Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to analysts’ statements earlier this week, the head of operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [power market].
And that would not be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue’s September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and ran Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), scripted reality-class overshoot video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the all-too-popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Ryan Up Seacret), all of which she covered with a swagger like
That’s the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children’s show (Seacrest brought up the sentence, “Did you think we’d forgotten you?” with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in that publicity.
With regards to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim likes to beat her on the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine’s September issue is a league in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of the year for Vogue.
With a scope more similar to a picture tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, of the 832 pages of the W<0xC3><0xA4>lzer were 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine were leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of it applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the final cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the lousy pieces of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the disdain seems to pass at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their kids.
Community Law Centers Dismiss 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most needy are rejected annually by community law centers, while the industry is geared towards the impact of further cuts in funding on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have access to funds for unjust relocations and the like – are already being rejected in their requests for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
James Farrell, director of Queesland’s community law centers, said the National Association of Community Law Centers’ latest survey found that thousands of people are already being turned down each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly dismissed – all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senators George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centers and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had fired a gun at an employee in February while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte County Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " drew a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run into Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — gun owners and gun friends — should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appoints judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint seeks damages from the campaign for the breach of duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-and-black government coalition could barely continue to govern in the north, this is not possible according to the poll figures in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus have good chances to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the Left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the Landtag for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (2011 election: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the draw as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was bigger and thicker, so it wasn’t in the right hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone now comes with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in a west pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML-browser, although painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold and handled to Microsoft.
The market today is dominated by providers, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere, that’s everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the devices amounted to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all via touch screen easy to use.
Apple’s victory began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the foresight.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian companies such as Samsung are now saying the same thing.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, chief of staff at Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like back in London in 2012, when we put a lot of effort into making sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – which was voted the world’s best airport terminal five years in a row – to T2, which was built amidst the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It’s time we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse Game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are tantamount to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the ad-blocking open source community and those around it has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as many in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has set it aside for ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over ads targeting them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks’ new filters would be worrisome because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, which is why we’ve focused instead on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman charged with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit in the early hours of Thursday by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and were hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, urging them and any witnesses to report the incident.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held to account.
In each of the two cases – where a person was running in the dark on the highway – it was decided that drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper called it.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections from a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, might have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, yet it continued slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus' slow rotation exposes its day-side to the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was probably habitable at one time, Venus -- over billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday and led a lack of co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternate President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as the Colorado Avalanche’s head coach and vice president of hockey operations with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14, Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put on strike
Work struggles over pay for North Sea oil workers are being put on hold as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, the negotiator said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” the company said in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had been exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different rates, and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other star clusters," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a discernible star spot -- such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
“In the Pleiades’ ‘ballet,’ we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to know more about, such as how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star has resigned.
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the U.S. baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.
"I say 'goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was named the most valuable player in the league, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he has scored some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar stats.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect, having received performance-enhancing funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.
“The league could have even done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said at the time.
Even his farewell days do not go silently.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to be in a relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy statements from fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An accomplished athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically-viewed athletics competitions, these news come at a time of no end.
In Chen’s case, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen was expected to take part in the 50m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter “very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations,” Xinhua said in a statement, “We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict.”
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa leaked through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is believed to be the blood-doping drug EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately responded with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the launch of the entire Russian team, except for one exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan runners also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pinkish purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also at the center of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to sit down for three months.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers blackmailed their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple, victims of a ransomware attack.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been targeted for ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski said in a statement.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software on their own.
At first, private users were the target, but the change towards corporate attacks took place in the past months frighteningly quickly.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money – usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware hits.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case, people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers investigated user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and came to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming increasingly professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that there are three or four people involved.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software box to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting, and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between $1,000 and $10,000.
“The scope of delivery includes an customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” Wisniewski says.
The blackmailers then look for other hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread,” Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better back up their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on being able to fend off ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful gratification, the perpetrators are instead threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” Malwarebytes chief executive Marcin Kleczynski said in a statement.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is still many times higher than before.
Also, the perpetrators could in the future take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in both the front row and the rear, it does not seem narrow at all.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the top of the cockpit falls off slightly.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of storage space.
Not only is there a luggage compartment of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair, offering storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his job a little more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top-version "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System, and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when positioning.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent timer responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles speed when needed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jacks are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards typical of air traffic, argued the Oberlandesgericht D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk to life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay compensation to the man.
Sickness case: When the organiser pays
Sick vacationers get their money back after their trip only if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was seriously ill from diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
In fact, the sewage system was defective.
However, the organiser only learned about it shortly before the complainants left.
Until then, he had to assume that the sea water was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must respond resolutely and resolutely at the same time to terrorist threats.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
However, if criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the people’s consent to the refugee policy.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re wants to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further staff reinforcement of the security forces, namely "on a medium four-digit scale over several years".
Compassionate advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be amended in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
According to de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>res, the last much-discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger to citizens, he said, with a view to mental connotations, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the sharpshooters in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Media Group newspaper on Friday.
De Maizi<0xC3><0xA8>re had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate action and ability to act with ever-new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Flots of speeches and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It is regularly crowded on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the legal loophole should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving over the highway feeder (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the state road construction company will extend the right-of-way by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e exit.
Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e on the right.
The big advantage: The traffic divides at an early stage, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representing M<0xC3><0xBC>nster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On working days, the traffic jam reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
From here, the traffic is only one-way over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of a century ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to accommodate heavy traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated day-to-day traffic jams will last cannot be said by the responsible state operator.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until 2034.
For the extension of the legal loophole, the state-owned company deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays, because it was to be expected with disabilities.
The traffic will pass the construction site in one lane on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
Intercultural travel: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an exhibition of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Junge Theater M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Kleine Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in M<0xC3><0xBC>nster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to M<0xC3><0xBC>nster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was still possible for them to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Junge Theater M<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally-led courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatrical play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The "Intercultural Journey" project continues.
In view of the increase in the number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of stargazing: Hope for better weather
The weather has made the stargazers in the southwest of Germany on Friday night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night had been ill-suited for observing the celestial spectacle due to clouds and rain, the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we probably see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The starbursts are Perseids, which at 216,000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest starbursts.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleeping Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning, far before the alarm clock is no longer to think about sleep.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel their sleep is not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Wee<0xC3><0x9F>, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood is insomnia, i.e. a sleep-in and sleep-through disorder.
It is precisely sleeping through that many people find unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German Association of General Practitioners with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is Behind Sleep Disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications, can be involved.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is especially common in depression,” says Wee<0xC3><0x9F>.
And it may be that different factors condition each other.
For example, if you have a tape drive incident, you can lie ill, wake up every two to three hours, and maybe start worrying about everyday problems and worries, Wee<0xC3><0x9F> gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, Wee<0xC3><0x9F> advises.
The impairment can look very different: one is depressed, tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks - in question.
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of the Charité Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, Wee<0xC3><0x9F> advises.
He can use investigations to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend for example for snoring with breathlessness, for sick daytime fatigue, for sleepwalkers or if the cause of a sleep disturbance is not found, explains Fietze.
You don’t actually have to prepare for the exam.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't go to sleep," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears a nosepiece, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleepers.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can put on for a better sleep.
Wee<0xC3><0x9F> counts on: regular sleep and wake-up times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken via Facebook about the disappointing finish of the DSV team at Olympias.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha, setting his first world record at the same time.
Now, former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has taken to Facebook to protect himself from his former teammates who are in criticism.
“In a country where an Olympic winner receives a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 prize and a jungle king <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The support system in swimming sports is poor, while the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at or even do so when it comes to doping.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be stopped here,” he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is how it should be with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS is not allowed to participate," said Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Gangs of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Thieves at D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Airport
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf police on Thursday arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf airport area recognized a gang known to police officers from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had acted in a communal, part-time and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the criminal police station 34 can prove four crimes to the thieves who had come to Germany specifically for the commission of crimes.
In total, they had won over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime still a remnant of cobblestones: The Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first glance, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
On the facade of a gray house, someone sprayed "ugly!"
A house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here by 2017 in front of a Lidl, which will also be demolished soon.
Articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are, however, preferably depicted with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin-based interior senator Henkel has repeatedly advocated a tough police action against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the cadre forge, had been cleared with 300 police officers on 22 June, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers, on behalf of the unknown house owners, renovated the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk in front of late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a picket fence that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police are opening between squatters and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects born from them have been part of Kiez for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to Riga.
While the Mainz had been cleared in a straight street battle under a large police order, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former housewives now share their passion.
This is also evident in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new hires.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they can be seen on cast-in discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed at police officers.
Most of the crimes are caused by property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is reassuring: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Rigaer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the residents get their way back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed supremacy over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like new builders, the street is still taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old residents.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not of interest to many here - rather, they are inhabited by people who are not so well looked after," she says.
"I cannot condone violence and destruction at all."
But what do you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are attracted to color bombs: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves in should be aware of this – just as someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee representative
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social educator supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, working group on refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milkshake, which above all has a problem.
Thus, some had meant - less mockingly than targeting the multitude of desired tasks - than the administration wanted to write off the post.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, namely an egg-laying wool milkshake.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has capped a 50 percent position at three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers will soon be in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
The refugees must be accommodated in their own or rented accommodation.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these properties must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Kommune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work so far, depending on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, public housing must be appropriated, as it is called so beautifully.
So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
"More seats would be good," reports Regine customer.
Many work in the construction yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is “no occupational therapy.”
But work is not just about work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also come in here.
It is crucial that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedure is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they cannot help anyone in Urbach, that they cannot work and that they are useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "People who do nothing at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a mammoth task.
A difficult question: are the two afraid of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive". A residual risk can and does not want to exclude them.
The helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a topic for refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, principals and volunteers on site and in the region have to look for activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new shock of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a border?
To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to be," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrating the previous people reasonably.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, you have to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Smuggler with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men broke into an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg at around 8.50 am on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the unholding into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodie.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to search for him.
The search went on without success.
Possibly the unknowns appeared before the deed near the apartment or on their escape.
Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack
After an attack on an Ulm snack, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker community because of a serious land peace break.
In the case of home searches, evidence and drugs were secured, police said on Friday.
According to police, about 20 masked men of a rock-like group had thrown bottles and stones against the window pane of an imbiss in July.
They then attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
Then they fled.
A damage of 10000 euros was caused at the snack bar and the adjacent building.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulm rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
