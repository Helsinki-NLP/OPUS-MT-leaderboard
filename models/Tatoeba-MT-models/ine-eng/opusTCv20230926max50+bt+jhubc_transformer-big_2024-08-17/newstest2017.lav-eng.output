28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to harm his brother, stating that, "His life has finally begun to improve."
The body, which was found Wednesday at the Westfield supermarket, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a representative of the San Francisco Courts Medical Expertise Office said.
San Francisco police said his death had been confirmed as a murder and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Luis Galicia tells ABC KGO that Franks previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he met his dream job at the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we will miss him very much," said the representative.
At this difficult time, we think we are together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia tells us that in the beginning Franks stayed in hostels, but lately life has finally improved.
"He gathered in a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station KGO.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a good man with a big heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to get into a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the rest.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a raw diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone with information about the incident is invited to call SFPD Information at 415-575-4444.
Young doctor's strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the young doctors ask their trade union to initiate protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Young Physicians Committee (JAC) is set to ask the council to support wider protests in early September.
The JAC believes that the ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the agreement.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
58% of all members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK Council member El<0xC4><0x93>na Makorta said that the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: "Given this, as a result of the JAC vote, the contract offer has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request new formal talks to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government’s silence, JAK today officially requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts that will come into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
Following a vote rejecting the contract terms proposed by the LMA and recommended by the BMA, the representative of the new doctors of the LMA, Dr. Johan Malawia, resigned.
Before meeting with 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunt, informed that the contract would be concluded with the doctors of England.
Russia and Turkey: Rejected alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to negotiate and announce the end of the eight-month term and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at the St. Petersburg Palace, there was an impression that this partnership was more necessary for Ankara.
However, they both shrugged.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked whimsical and did not cause warm emotions, even given his usual reluctance.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an at least five times nicknamed Putin as his "dear friend", according to a survey of the meeting.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm provokes conflicting feelings.
However, Putin’s radiance shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the downing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted roughly.
Putin accused Ankara of putting a dune on the back of Moscow.
The transformation was even more painful, given that it came from the side of a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, however, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television carried aggressive insults against Ankara.
All of a sudden, the Turks seemed to be to blame.
The most serious allegations were that Erdogan’s own family profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefits of peace in Ankara are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed coup last month in which he was tried to be gassed.
In addition, countless terrorist attacks have shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually provides an influx of several million Russian tourists to resorts in Turkey each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies will be relieved in the wake of the restoration of regular flights.
They are hoping for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean season under.
Already this week, the state TV expects fruit and vegetable prices to fall as Turkish fruit and vegetable imports will resume.
As quoted by the local newspaper Vedemesti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, there were other political motives on the part of Moscow for the visit.
Ankara is angry with the West for, in their opinion, a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
One can also take a look at the dissatisfaction with the protracted accession talks between the EU and Putin, who is happy to take advantage of the situation of Turkey's secession from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing support for its elected government after a coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it is itself deeply rooted in the fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside palace, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analyst called it, the "rejected alliance", the two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity shown publicly, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a vehicle for peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the disagreements between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey crashed a Russian fighter jet, the situation has improved, as the two leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
The brand SKB will play a supporting role in the future, the Bank’s Executive Director has announced.
It will no longer be available outside of Scotland.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank’s ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up on these ambitions, as eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with Six Nations Rugby and ending with Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands on the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to customers in Scotland, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the main office and the official stock exchange list, will be changed to the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also gain attention.
Makevan was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees in Inverness.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become a brand of our investors and with whom our employees work, because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
Over time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, due to hard work and focusing on customer needs rather than our own needs, we have obviously made a big change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3000th victory, gaining first place in the Newmarket with the horse Predilection
Detori recertifies the champagne by winning his 3000th victory twice finishing the first race in the Newmarket.
On Friday, the jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of the United Kingdom, taking first place in the Newmarket.
He achieved it by winning a second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, by going with Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to have achieved such results in horse racing.
He has joined Seram Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Eder and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with a horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that it happened in the Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Ascot, but an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predilection are expected with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in obstacle races - champion Richard Johnson and 20-time champion Sers Antony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, winning more than 4,300 victories.
Lester Pigott, a nine-time derby winner, won 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of today's best jockeys and it's no surprise that he's had successes that only the rarest can achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his sense of tactics distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attracts fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago in the Epsom race, I told Frankie that he would have won 6,000 victories if he had not participated in just the weekend and the big races.
But seriously speaking, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been winning regular races in the United Kingdom for 30 years now.
He is a lively man, who is a great fit for British racing, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his company's brand - flying jump.
From finishing at wind speed to flying downhill, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventure full of paths.
He has won countless big races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Askota, and has also survived plane crashes and disqualifications for the use of drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time coming back after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who doubted him to return to his best form.
And he could participate in the race for a while longer - Detori has previously said that he would gladly continue to participate in the race until at least the age of 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was in the ranks of Putin’s closest people.
Currently, the 63-year-old politician has been appointed as special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin "decided to relieve Ivanova of the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", without mentioning the reason.
Antons Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed to the post of Ivanov.
The 44-year-old is a retired diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the administration of the Presidential Protocol and government employees.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main job of the administration is to support your work as the president of the country by drafting laws and controlling the execution of your decisions.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and recommended Vaino as his replacement.
Does the smile convince you?
This step has brought Moscow to its knees.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, once worked in the Soviet security service of the VDK.
In this position he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a meeting broadcast on national television, both men announced that Ivanovs was stepping down on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cameras, which are rarely convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the struggle for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that the husband, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the head of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great scepticism.
In comments published on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov says to Putin: “It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this difficult position, I could even say a problematic position, for four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanovs took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the State Security Service of the SDC, just like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of the GDK, Ivanovs took up his deputy position.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as the transfer of Putin to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and three and a half years later he returned to office as president.
The appearance of puzzling fish in a garden in Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out the conditions of what species of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be sand mites that have gone off with a water rod.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone might know how these 5-centimeter-sized fish got into his garden.
Crossing of the Quinsphere: the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Kvinsferia junction and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Faifa Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge."
In this project we see an unsurpassed engineering solution, where more than 30 000 tons of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the connection between the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the deck of the bridge has already been built and the last stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering.
After the installation of the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we had to connect the northern stage of the road with the land or viaduct.
This was done by moving the part of the viaduct of the northern driveway 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be raised sloped by about 3 %.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions, with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simon Bails gets gold in women's gymnastics.
Forget about the gap.
Forget the anxiety.
Simon Bails doesn't mind.
Dynamic jumps.
Without effort performs exercises on the log.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Totally flawless.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was higher than that of the silver medallist and her teammate Alia Raismane and the bronze medallist of the Russian athlete Alia Mustafa.
On Thursday, US athlete Simona Bails performed an exercise on the individual multi-fight final for women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-fight championship and the fifth best gymnast, gradually cementing his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and possibly the best gymnast in history.
When the final result was announced, she spilled into tears because the long road to this moment was over.
This achievement brought him to the side of such insurmountable athletes as Michael Phelps, who took his sport to another level.
Fear has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such exquisite, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called him a "winner"
In Brazil, she was expected to undergo the last test, where she was largely faced with the hopes placed on her, rather than with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Bails (left) and Alija Raismane compete in the individual multi-fight final for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal Bails won on Tuesday, making special selection coordinator Marta Karolji a welcome party.
While Bails claims that he had not expected anything like this on his long journey to the heights of glory, it is not true.
Part of her performance in free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic Games arena.
It's not an accident.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and who was discovered by coach Amy Burman’s mother on a trip to the gym, where Burman’s tarts took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in multi-fights since the summer of 2013 and the winning series can continue as long as Bails wants.
Although Mustafina was slightly in control during the two rotations, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and the free movement - part of the race, where Bails will defend his championship title, is still only in front.
She advanced to the front with a score of 15,433 on the log and strengthened the control with a score of 15,933 free moves
Raismane gently hugged her while she waited for the results, which were only a formality and she poured joy into tears when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was like a small revenge for the four-year-old events when she shared third place with Mustafa, but lost the battle for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who Americans call a "grandmother", stood out in convincing leadership.
After the performance in the free movements, which dispelled doubts about her return, she could devote herself to the effort of air kissing.
While the 19-year-old Bails’ viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, now has a completely different meaning.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, a "slaughter victim," survives a gunfight in Philadelphia.
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he is already the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahaj Brown.
The parents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, tells the television: "His little body was just a bullet wound."
I couldn't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in a hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start going to the first grade of the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether any of them were the attackers.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that a number of shooters were likely involved in the shooting.
At the scene of the event, the shells of the gun cartridges belonging to different weapons were found.
It appears to have been a prolonged shelling.
On both sides of the pavement of pedestrians are found shells.
"So it looks like there were a number of gunmen here who were actively involved in the shooting," says Philadelphia Police Captain Antonio Ginaldi.
The damage has also been done to several houses and cars.
No one has yet been arrested and police are reported to be checking CCTV footage.
On Tuesday, a six-year-old girl was hit by a bullet while she was playing outside her home in the Vestouklein district.
She gradually recovers, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Lightweight Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First, I’ve been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. team has never been so good.
Secondly, this team has three athletes, Simon Bails, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many new girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team also includes Ali Raismane, who is Jewish, and Medison Cocian, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team truly represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabija took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gaby Douglas surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America was able to rejoice.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-time world champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented, but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's individual multi-fight.
A member of her team, Alija Raismane, won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but the situation in the rest of the country during the training hours is completely different.
Simona, Gaby and Laurie were included in the Olympic selection, as were Ali and Medison.
They are "Olympic Piecinieks" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Marta Karolas's work as a coach.
In fact, gymnastics is an expensive sport. Gymnasts mainly train in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, space, travel, uniforms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletic clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take away all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term investment for athletic families.
Eimija B<0xC5><0xAB>rmana - Simon Bails coach and Megija Hainija - Laurija Hernandez coach has coached her athletes since both girls started to practice athletics.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabija and Laurija with cheaper exercise training options.
I founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem and we offer more than 15 000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) workouts for free or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to give local youth the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Light athletics develops the coordination of strength, curvature and body, as well as teaches hard work, discipline and striving for the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
It is very important to play this sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of the "Girl Power" by winning the Olympic Games gold medals and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of the offer by Jeremy Hunt, the young doctors plan to launch more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, which was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that the NHS is in an unstable state and further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to the conditions for working night shifts and weekends, in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, the representative of the new doctors of the BMA, Dr. El<0xC4><0x93>na Makourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors will sign the new contract, so progress must be made because there is not much time left.
BMA’s efforts to solve the problem through negotiations have been met with a reluctance by the government to get involved and sometimes with complete silence.
This was despite the fact that, as late as last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, stop the inactivity and work with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest actions.
More than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed during the last strike at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the rate of work over the weekend for 54,000 new doctors who would be covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr. Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase the pressure on the burdened workers and cause stress and inconvenience to patients, carers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the new Committee of Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guardians and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as the placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programs, dropping out of school and getting paid for sex, etc.
Medication for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, because the official representatives recommend using it for more people and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of repeated heart attacks.
The NHS-represented NICE recommends taking this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NHS currently advises NICE to use this medicine for 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease.
About 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them experience a repeat heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If the blockage ruptures, it can create a thrombus, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thrombus separates from the blood vessel wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having a repeat heart attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the UK firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of Health Technology at NICE, explains: “Despite the availability of drugs to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke that often has severe consequences.”
Fears of repeated heart attacks can leave a negative impression on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have experienced it before.
When we provisionally recommend treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who have thus benefited.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding with this medicine for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend its use for longer than this period.
Political Correctness Culture Promotes Electoral Fraud in Muslim Communities
According to the management report, the former Mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from his post in connection with corruption.
The government’s report reveals that the culture of political correctness has led to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sers Eriks Pikls criticizes the police, election monitors and city councils for ignoring signs of fraud in the electoral process, because "they are afraid of offending ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organization, says that voter intimidation is so widespread for religious reasons that police should be allowed to deploy guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a personal identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voters with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs also need to provide more protection, says Sers Eriks.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from the wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Downing Street after a scandal related to the Tauerhamlet city elections.
Last year, the special election court decided to remove the mayor Lutfur Rahman from the post of mayor of the city due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynicized" his Muslim community's religious views and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the view that it is the religious duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
About 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Also, Sers Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud all over the country.
He pointed out that fraud in postal voting is particularly worrying, where the older members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sers Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document confirming the identity of the person.
His report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote for the community's elected elders, especially in the Bangladesh and Pakistani communities."
"There are concerns that district authorities are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, as it could affect ethnic and religious interests."
Sers Eriks presented 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists from acting with votes cast by mail in order to prevent "voting".
The report, which examines Theresa May, also called for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
Consider asking voters to present a personal identification document before the vote.
Mark the fingers of the voter with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically verify the nationality of a person to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting by mail.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from working with votes cast by mail and ballot envelopes for voting by mail.
To provide the police with the authority to appoint guards at polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the summoning of persons to liability for intimidation in accordance with the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit the taking of photographs in polling stations.
To determine the requirements for the use of the English language only (except in Wales) in the constituencies.
Reinforce training to ensure that polling stations staff go to polling stations one by one.
Sers Eriks vehemently criticises the Metropolitan Police, expressing a misunderstanding that no charges have been brought in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was conclusively found guilty on the basis of the standard of proof of criminal law, on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticises the "check-in" of inefficient city council voters at voter registration precincts.
Sir Eric points out: "Last year's court decision is a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the birthplace of parliament, but the alarming and hidden election fraud and the exposure of the institutions that fraud does not take place endangers this good reputation.
Wreckage by a cyclist - Keith's partner and other Rio Olympic celebrities
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics will be excited about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who has been recognized by fans as extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete who is fighting for gold this summer, which, according to the media, is proud of its fame as a partner.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of participants of the Olympic Games, which is completely similar to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and the Wolf: A member of the US team of archers Breedy Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since childhood
Apart from Keith's fellow cyclist on the cycling track, many people on the Internet indicate that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's ring team, tweeted a storm when photos were posted of him very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
The athlete himself noticed the storm on social media and acknowledged that he was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
"I personally don't see much similarity except for the beard," Breedy tells Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I take that as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular pairs of London 2012 Olympic teammates will undoubtedly gain even more popularity: the striking resemblance between British television host Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Thanks to her large, expressive eyes, the Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina is compared to the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgs has been compared to Matthew Morrison, the star of "Created for the Stage".
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is a sports version of the actor in the movie "Inception".
Similarly, former peers are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalin McCord can boast not only of sun-tanned skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that athletic American athlete Nathan Adrian is similar to Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Scary Women: Football star (left) Houpai Solo and actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes to the series "Dexters".
Not one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: this user believes that there may be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user announced with real joy that "the rest of the internet users are unanimous that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The American football star and the actress of the series "Deksters" really has a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons apply to Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linnaeus. Likewise, gold medalist Gabi Douglas boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles Gabriel’s “Bring It On” smile.
The CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has been 'finished like a pig'.
Bairon Macdonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha finish in fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle relay for women, caused a chilling storm in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize, as one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer from the competition had "escaped from the competition, died alone" and "finished like a pig".
Commentator Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when 4x200 m freestyle relays for women in the final presented their personal opinion .
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to give the comments a vibrancy, said: "This little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up."
"When she got in, she flew out of the race, she died alone and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much!
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second stage was 1:57.79, it is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers across Canada reacted immediately on the Internet, as they were shocked to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the live air.
Ai Yanha of China's 4x200m freestyle finale for women was named the "little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't stick around."
The criticism against Bairon Macdonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users could not believe it when they heard the insensitive comments of Bairon Macdonald.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like racists. #opposite.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was then running CBC Live, apologized for Macdonald's comments, saying, "We apologize that the comment about the swimming result was echoed on live air."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
Macdonald's colleague Scott Russell had to apologize to him instead.
The CBC then apologized to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Macdonald’s comment.
The channel also quickly posted an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and they came on the live air.
Yesterday we immediately reacted and apologized to all the live viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon’s comments were expressed about the swimmer’s performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were in any case unprofessional and unsuccessfully selected statements, and Bairon very much regrets what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on live air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On CBC's Olympic live broadcast, he said: "I would like to take this moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competition."
I am talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I had not intended to show disrespect and I am really very sorry that this happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who unashamedly fits in the middle of a lingerie store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to undress in order to hold the panties in the middle of the store.
Even further exacerbating the situation, she kept them to make sure they stuck to her and then pulled them off, putting the panties back on the store shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Folkeston Bouverie Place shopping mall and grabbed four more panties.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkeston – a place where this woman put on underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At the same time, there was also the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who tells us that an unknown woman, after putting on her underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people could not believe their eyes.
While standing in the middle of the store, she took off her underpants from the shelf, took off her pantyhose and pants, and measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she simply stuck them there on the spot.
Everyone watched her pull off her panties and apparently the woman didn’t like them because she just put them back on the shelf.
She measured three more panties until she decided she didn’t like any of them and left the store.
It didn’t seem to bother her that someone was looking or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was holding.
The young lady of Davidson (33 years) from Kent says: "The idea of the heart is that someone will buy clothes that have been accepted by another person and that have not been washed after that."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
The young lady added: "I assume that after her departure, the shop staff removed these clothes from the shop shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine if I could buy a new underwear and find out that another woman has worn it and hasn't washed it afterwards.
A Primark representative indicated that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothes are removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself at close range from attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's Grandmaster from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you’re attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain control over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then it is necessary to turn first to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon must be held between his front arm and shoulder and make a hit on the opponent's face with his free elbow.
Then there is a fight with a path around the circle and while the attacker is in pain, you have to take away his weapon, stick it across your face with the blade of the weapon and retreat, continuing to point the weapon at him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - avoid the trajectory of the shot, hold the gun and deploy it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on the weapon and the opponent must be beaten through the chest and finally he must take the weapon away from him and retreat while continuing to point at him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how exactly Mizraki does it.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, it's safer to give your money back to the robber.
The Van<0xC4><0x81>li family demolishes the social house of Salta<0xC5><0xA1>a Kornvola and is laid out on the street.
The Vandals family has been forced from their homes to terrorize their neighbors, damaging a <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 social home.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Sean Trebilkoks onlyremained out of the property in Saltash Cornwall, because of several complaints about them.
When they were forced out of the property, shocked representatives of the housing service found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was being scoured everywhere, and the walls were covered with graffiti.
The family is now expropriated from the property and is most likely living in a private property.
Donna Makevoya, a manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says there are concerns that it will not be possible to renovate the home.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like this.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, as in the future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who stayed in the property periodically and the police say that their terror manifested itself as violence, digging in the street with baseball bats, intimidating the local population, drug use, drug sales and loud slapping and beating.
47-year-old Skeldon, to whom the name was given, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
In the rooms of several demolished houses, excavated waste was found.
In the house, where it is possible to trade drugs in advance, several floor boards are also removed.
Neighbours say that they regularly wandered on the street and are constantly called the police.
They were forced out of the property by the Cornwall Housing Service when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house on a voluntary basis.
The disillusioned neighbors were very happy about the exhibition, because their life had been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It's amazing how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep tonight.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the Cornwall Housing Service’s Neighbourhood Protection, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police here.
In the garden of the house were found various old and useless objects.
He also said: "It is very regrettable that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behavior, because evicting from home is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Household Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and the neighbors had been very hard to watch their behavior.
I appreciate the work that my entire team, the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members have put into this case, who have been courageous and have worked with us to provide the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for our neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here at different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress that remains on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
Service personnel will now have to clean up the pile of waste left behind in the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1700 in cash.
Skeldone was only found guilty of storing Class B narcotic substances for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended to be a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the exhibition, it became known that they are currently renting a private property in Plymouth.
On many walls of the house were drawn graffiti.
The police say that they will continue to expose tenants who violate their leases.
The representative of Devon and Cornwall Police, Angel Krov, points out that this exposé is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said that: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they please and that there will be no consequences."
The Devon and Crohn's Police have no acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can give an impetus to the economy.

The mayor of Cannes has banned burkini swimwear on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern resort city of Cannes has banned the wearing of burkini swimwear on the beaches of this city, which almost completely covers the body of a woman and is very reminiscent of a water suit, local officials said Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linars, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"Swimming suits, which outwardly show religious affiliations at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create a risk of disruption to public order (drunkenness, collisions, etc.) that needs to be avoided," the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about outdoor clothing, which is associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us," explained the head of the municipal municipal services, Tjer<0xC4><0xAB> Miguls.
He added that burkini swimsuits have not been seen on the beaches of Cannes since 28 July, when Linar, a member of the centre-right Republican Party, signed the order and it came into force.
This week, a water park in the city of Marseilles cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed in burkini swimsuits, because politicians from both the right and left circles expressed outrage over such an event.
In France, it is forbidden to wear Muslim women's headscarves, but religious symbols or appropriate clothing are not prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby resort town of Cannes, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.
On July 26, two attackers, who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, brutally murdered priests in a church in the northwest of France.
"Jysk" a year ago tumor turnover of 5%
"Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk") Ltd., a retailer of household goods, grew its turnover by 5% last year, reaching 23.66 million euros, according to "Firmas.lv" information.
The turnover of the company in 2014 was 22.57 million euros.
The company's profit also increased slightly - from 781 235 euros in 2014 to 785 896 euros a year ago.
The management report says that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street and closed the store in Riga, Kurzeme Avenue.
This year, like other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended that the profits made last year be left undivided.
"Jysk" is an international network of stores that offers goods for home improvement.
"Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The capital of the company is 3 500 264 euros.
The company belongs to the company "Joska Eignarhaldsfelag ehf av PLC" registered in Iceland.

The festival "Kubana" has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, August 11, in the evening in Lucavsala was given a start to one of the last festivals of this summer - there until Sunday night "Kubana" will take place.
On the first night of the meeting, bands such as Enter Shikari from the UK, which was expected a year ago, but disappeared from the program without fail, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival there are worthy words in the program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage" in the works of "Guano Apes" and "Garbage" in the works of "Ramones" legend drummer Markijs Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leaders of the Belarusian punk band "Vagalju".
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not deter the organizers from their repeated attempt to symbolize it - they added a long sign to the name, included in the program a Latvian group (on Friday evening at 19:15 on the stage "All Day Long") and announced that the festival was "all day long" and announced that the festival would be held in Riga.
Whether these efforts will be justified is still too early to judge, because the festival only took place, but, as observed on the first evening of "Delphi Entertainment", at least for the time being huge efforts of people to attract did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British triathlon team has twice won the Olympic record and won the sprint.
The United Kingdom's third team twice improved the Olympic record on Thursday and won the men's sprint.
The first Olympic record was improved by the British in qualifying, but in the first round it was improved again by the New Zealanders.
The British team met New Zealand in the Sprint final, and the Brits stripped the New Zealanders of the Olympic record title, leaving them with silver medals.
The final British team won with a result of 42,440 seconds, beating the New Zealanders by 0.102 seconds.
In the battle for bronze, the French team defeated Australia.
It should be noted that the record was also corrected in qualifying for the women's race - the British team improved the world record, which is now 4:13.260.
The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgale - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustav Zemgal.
Zemgal proclaimed the state of Latvia, but undeservedly remained in the shadow of the widely described first President of Latvia J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akstes and the last President of the pre-war period K<0xC4><0x81>rlis Ulmanis.
No other of our statesmen has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, Arnold Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> writes in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal, published ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few high-ranking politicians who had a sense of humor.
The rest are so rigid, always very correct.
He taught not to be like that, nowadays it could be similar to what Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis is.
"He was the one who was close to the people," says Ausi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Today's politicians have a poor knowledge of history, they refer to Karl Ulmani as a good leader, but hardly anyone knows how bad he was.
In government meetings, the only person he didn’t yell at was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
“With its sense of humor and democracy, Zemgals leaves the exact opposite impression,” says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia agrees with Auzi<0xC5><0x86>a’s assessment of Zemgal as a calm and balanced statesman.
He also notes that Zemgale excelled with respect to minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
"At that time, it was not usual to act, after the presidency of Zemgale Albert Kvies took over this tradition," says the historian.
He was such a quiet and measured man that he had to agree to become president for a long time.
He himself did not seek it, he simply does not thirst for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but he believed that the president should definitely understand it.
"During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgal did not allow himself to be nominated again, he did not like his high position.
In any case, he is a very respectable person in the history of Latvia, he was already in a serious position before he arrived at the presidential palace - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Zemgal also ran the famous Zemgal cash register on Suvorova Street 3, where there was a depositors’ and depositors’ association, which practically became the Latvian state in government negotiations.
He was always in a progressive mood.
There was no great admirer of Ulmani, but he did not publicly object to it either.
“In private negotiations, it has sometimes been said that Ulmani’s actions do not really sympathize with him,” Stranga said.
You have lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of wrongdoing or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember these days?
Unfortunately, for the most part, he associates himself with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute Democrat, his views were central.
"There were no major upheavals during his time, that is, he could be associated with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga sums up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which at that time indirectly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighboring country and inclusion in the family of Northern European democratic nations.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale paid a state visit to Stockholm.
King Gustav V of Sweden visited Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but passed away in January 1939.
Simple ways to help your child cope with an angry attack.
I often have to face the fact that the anger of the child, the appearance of anger parents consider something wrong and abnormal.
When the child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates the psychologist Ekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these so natural and human feelings - anger and resentment, which are periodically experienced by each.
Aggression - it is already a physical action directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we, as adults, are angry, anxious - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other loved ones, we can in anger spread a sofa, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to spread anger!), go in the shower and do something else.
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know different other ways to deal with these emotions.
When children encounter them with anger, they do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool," "Bad mom," "I don't see you," "I won't cheat on you" - and very rarely, when you can say, "I'm angry at you."
Children live in the literal sense, they are completely located right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and true in the manifestation of their feelings, and often also are in the grip of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not be upset about it and cheat, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do you need a break in your relationship?
A spirited working day, where everything has not gone the way you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to "unplug" from the whole world for a moment, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to break the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or does it still show that each of the partners has its own way?
The Lords share their views at different ages.
John (23) is short and concise: "In my opinion, if a break is needed in a relationship, then you are not with the right person".
Meanwhile, Eduard (30) has discovered a scheme that may be able to help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves about every little detail, then definitely - this is the right moment when you should look at other hunting grounds to understand whether you miss her, or especially about her do not think about her or even do not want to see her at all anymore.
So the answer is - yes, pausing can help save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, the relationship should be kept a break from each other on a daily basis, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other is doing, and it begins to fall on your nerves.
People start to annoy each other, especially when there’s nothing to talk about, except what you’ve done in a day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that elsewhere or at another is better - then why this woman with whom you are with, has deserved one who can think that there is not good enough here and behind the mountains there are fields of paradise?
Thinking is already a small betrayal.
If not, then not.
"I have, so I condemn those who are not a little." says Edmunds (46).
Why is it important to have a good relationship with your partner?
I think everyone needs a moment of rest.
You cannot look into each other’s eyes every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and rejoice in the incorruptible love.
Atopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everyone has their own time.
Of course, even for a friend or a wife, however, if both are able to keep their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
This and only this.
M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> (27) said: "It is difficult to say - whether it is necessary or not, you can or you cannot take a break from it, but one thing is clear - there is nothing in the relationship to the end for the proposer, something is missing."
If this question is true, then it should be taken into account that in the near future there will be some changes - on the right or on the wrong side, it depends on yourself.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, you still need to pause - something all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talk of rest.
You decide to spend the rest of your life together!
"If you can't handle each other's society now, and you need a space once in a while, then what will happen when you're retired, who comment on how stray cats are freaking out or arguing about which day the garden should do better," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.
With its exciting and exciting personality, Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls was the first to awaken the interest of the Latvian people in the performing arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable", it was written about the Latvian painter Jani Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l at the time.
In 2016, when the grandmaster opened a large retrospective exhibition in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is also clear that Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be on view until 30 October.
The National Museum of Art of Latvia with a wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall of the painter Jani Rozent<0xC4><0x81>lu (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included in the calendar of the famous days of UNESCO on an international scale.
The retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 150 works, is one of the central events of Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls’ annual programme.
The selection of works of art is mostly made up of the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of the classic creative activity, stylistic change and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Art and Music, the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
The atmosphere of centuries of passing is revived by the presence of photographs, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the links of individual works of art with photographs taken by the painter himself with his own camera for the purposes of creativity.
While the Finnish-Latvian Association "Rozentals-seura", named in the name of the Latvian classic, the Latvian National Museum of Art at the same time offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a view in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the "Virka" gallery in Helsinki in autumn.
Mets Leblanc is looking forward to his return to TopGear.
Matt Leblanc, the head of TopGear, said he was looking forward to returning to the second season of the show, but admitted that he did not know what to expect in the future.
So far, nothing official is happening.
"If it does, it will be reported to the BBC," Leblanc said in a conversation with television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas on the floor!" arose in July, when Leblanc's boss Chris Evans announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans acknowledged that Leblanc and "Gas on the floor!" are "as created for each other."
Evans describes the former "Friends" star as a "real and handsome man", thus spreading rumours that the friendship between the two was lost during filming.
When Leblancm asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that the show is not currently scheduled to replace Evans in the new 24th season.
Kalvi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>: Meldonia could already be removed from the list of banned substances by athletes this year.
It is expected that the meldonium contained in the drug Mildronats produced in Latvia could already be excluded from the list of banned substances by athletes this year, said Ivars Kalvi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, director of the Institute of Organic Synthesis of Latvia, academician, in the LNT broadcast on Friday morning for 900 seconds.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss the Meldonia issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed hope that Mildronate will be removed from the "black list" already this year.
In Sigulda, after the collision, two cyclists were taken to the hospital.
In Sigulda, on Swiss street, two cyclists collided, suffering various injuries, according to the State Police.
The accident involved men born in 1987 and 1990, who were both taken to a medical institution.
In Koknese, too, the cyclist suffered a fall.
In 1989, a man fell on the street in 1905 and was taken to the care of a doctor.
While in the Dobele region, in the parish of Naud<0xC4><0xAB>te, in 1989, a motorcyclist was born trying to avoid the dog that has run off on the road and overturned.
He's in the hospital, too.
On the last day, 71 road traffic accidents in Latvia have been recorded, in which 16 people have been injured.
In some places, it will become colder.
Also on Friday in Latvia some rain is expected in some places and will become even cooler by some degree, the agency LETA learned about the Latvian Center for Environment, Geology and Meteorology.
It is possible to make a purchase for places.
According to forecasts, rain is expected mainly in Kurzeme and Vidzeme in the north.
The maximum air temperature will be only +16, +19 degrees.
The day in Riga will be without precipitation and mostly sunny.
However, the air will not be warmer than +18 degrees.
The backstage of the US model business in his interpretation has gained a perverse gleam of exquisite photo shoot and the inexorability of horror film.
Basically - a very provocative, balancing work of sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the boundaries between the European art house film and the territory of the Hollywood genre are difficult to break down.
The film with Vigo Mortensen in the main role emphasizes the question of whether conceptually chosen life models (ecological, vegetarianism, alternative and demarcation from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring happiness or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children, an idealist after the death of his wife, is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.
This is a moving, life-changing film, which Mets Ross won the Cannes Film Festival Award for directing this year.
Of course, sharks only do it as an attack on beautiful girls - in the jaws it was a swimmer, in this case - a brave surfer, portrayed by the White Ship.
The work demanded of her a thorough heroism.
This survival solo number can be compared to the performance of James Franco in the film 127 hours and the performance of Ryan Reynolds in the film Apraqts Alive.
It may also be due to the main role of the illustrator Mila Kunis, whose transformations from a role model into a creative resident and an adventurer of family values seem to be only the imaginations of the completely desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State militants, fleeing from Menbiza, in Syria's Aleppo province, have seized about 2,000 civilians used as live ammunition, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance and observers said on Friday.
"We didn't shoot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerusalem," a spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij military council said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbij was liberated from the jihadists.
The Islamic State of Menbi<0xC5><0xBE>u took over in 2014.
QSD has already last week welcomed most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbiza, but some remained and showed civil resistance.
However, on Friday they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
The Islamists are heading to Jerabulus, which is on the Turkish border.
Also, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that the Islamic State had kidnapped around 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists had hijacked the city's residents' cars, forced people to get into them, and then took them to Jerusalem.
Islamic State fighters have also carried out mass kidnappings of people in the past.
In January, Islamists captured more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria.
Later, the Islamists released about 270 of the prisoners.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled from Menbija is not known.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that the QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbij.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, lost their lives in the Battle of Menbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
You have to be careful not to overdo it.
The head of the State Environment Service Inga Kolegov decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA was informed by the Ministry of Finance.
Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova points out that the discussion of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussion are related to the visible, but more often invisible interests of politicians and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional abilities.
“It’s not acceptable to me either,” says already a candidate for the post of CEO of VID.
In the event that her candidacy is approved by the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked out and implemented by the SDGs, feeling the support of the whole government.
Without it, a full-fledged job would not be possible, Kolegova concludes.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment my entire candidacy process is overly politicized," the official explains.
"Thanks for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I valued as a benefit," Kolegova writes in the submission to Reizniece-Ozola.
The unit stated on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kol<0xC4><0x97>govo there were "significant contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in public registers about the costs of dividends of SIA Pallogs, because the publicly available decisions of the meetings of Pallogs participants do not provide for profit sharing.
At present, the Head of the MED is the Deputy Director-General of Dace Pel<0xC4><0x93>k<0xC4><0x81>.
In Livonia, the police are involved in the rescue of two unsupervised children, informs the State Police Administration of Latgale region.
The report on unsupervised strollers with infants was received on Friday at around 7 a.m.
They are located in Livani near the former store building.
The two little girls were immediately handed over to the doctors for help.
There was also a bag with documents and a mobile phone left in the wheels.
Within half an hour, the law enforcement officers found out the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
When the woman arrived at the home of a civilian, the police found that the woman was sleeping because of a strong alcohol intoxication.
According to the original information, on the evening of the previous day, in 1992, a woman was born and went to a friend, where she used alcohol.
While walking home after a joint session, the woman decided to leave the children at the store in uncharted circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage, which will also decide on the further fate of the children.
Free port of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of VK regarding the project of the Russian island.
The Riga Freeport Authority has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (NC) regarding the development of the infrastructure project for the transfer of port activities from the city center to the Russian island, Diena.lv portal informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Freeport Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the National Audit Office, in preparing the necessary documentation for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Authority also guided the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport Authority of Riga and the recommendations made for further improvement of project management.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the NC today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Freeport Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned within the project have been completed in full within the specified deadlines and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also the stevedores, that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says the Head of the project of the Russian island of Sanaire.
The existing long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the project objective was supplemented with the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the deadlines for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the boundary monitoring tools of the planned construction process, as well as the significance of the milestones.
The approved action plan to achieve the project goal by December 31, 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the CC, supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the duration of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the Freeport of Riga.
To improve project management and reduce potential risks, a project management plan has been developed, defining the project management areas and specifying the documents developed that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management structure scheme has been developed, which reflects the planned project management team structure, staff qualifications and functions.
In order to improve communication between the Riga Freeport Authority and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which defines, in addition to the parties defined in the project action plan, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange for the successful completion of the project.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for concluding a service contract or launching a procurement contract and the rule of law will have to be substantiated in more detail in the future.
Within the framework of the project, a world-standard port infrastructure has been built on the Russian island - four new deep-water piers, railway lines, as well as engineering communications.
The buildings co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year, achieving a saving of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.6 million.
Security at airports has been strengthened in Slovakia due to the threat.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia stepped up security measures at several airports on Friday, the Interior Ministry said.
"Given the threat, we have stepped up security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," Slovakia's Interior Ministry spokesman told AFP on Friday.
"The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analysing the information we have received," he added.
An informal European Union (EU) summit will take place in the Slovak capital on 16 September, with the participation of all bloc countries except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK’s Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the communist yoke of the former borders of East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims have still not been dispelled.
According to data released Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989 on the border with the Western Allied zones and the later West German communist authorities, 1841 people were murdered trying to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and every now and then corrects the number of victims.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including the deaths of a six-year-old boy who drowned while trying to reach his family in western Germany via then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
"The ultimate extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says the museum's director, Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the communist-controlled country are maintained and not lost," Hildebrandt said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is unconvincing," Johann Staats, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, told S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
Together with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, he is currently reviewing suspected deaths at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been confirmed.
Previously, researchers had estimated that 138 people had been killed by communists near the Berlin Wall alone.
Given the number of people who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or reach the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is considerably less than in 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all suicides of the East German border guards, regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths that are not directly related to violence.
"If seniors between the ages of 70 and 80 died of a heart attack after contracting border control, it must be the consequences of this 'murderous border'," Hildebrante believes.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction must be made between the old people who may have died as a result of their care and those whose deaths were caused by prolonged waiting on a hot bus at the border.
Irrespective of its victims, the census is not easy, because the communist authorities of East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to distribute documents in the various scattered archives, says <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x81>ts.
However, the <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x81>ta Group has recently acquired new documents and could therefore come up with an estimate of the number of new victims in the near future.
President Pone of the LPF went to Rio with the accreditation of the coach; this is a surprise to himself.
In recent days, the President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riode<0xC5><0xBE>aneiro, has arrived at the Olympic Games with the accreditation of the coach, but he himself feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, a wide-ranging upheaval was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova coach German Jakubovsk, who revealed that at the last moment he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro to Pone while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially, the list of riders was approved by swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Deivs Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation reported five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the flight Aldons Vrub<0xC4><0xBC>evskis claimed that the Germans will be and he is being sought tickets.
"However, obviously for objective reasons he was not," said Mr. Pone, expressing the view that it did not affect Mr. Ribakov's result.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja’s coach undertook to help her.
Mr., who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, sharply criticised the LOK's actions, blaming the Olympic sports watchdog.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons on the LOK Executive Committee and not to take any of them with you.
"I don't know exactly why the Swimming Federation didn't have enough space," Pone said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents was not appreciated by the public, reminding them that the presidents of the federation don't receive salaries.
Similarly, Mr. Jakubovski criticized himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone, however, could not tell why he is in the Olympic Games with the accreditation of a coach, who probably had to go to Jakubovski.
"I was nominated as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of a coach and now I am not going anywhere."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought that the Germans would be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before the start of Ribakov, she had an eye-to-eye conversation with Pony and after her swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the president of the LPF himself said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to tune the athletes before the start.
Pone reminded that LPF monitors five sports that are in the Olympic program, and four of them are training for children also in Latvia.
The President of the Federation said that it is also very important in Latvia to address the issues of defecation and also about such programs, having been in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that 2018 in Latvia could be the World Cup stage.
The location in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, I spend my time and I try to implement the four-year programs.
600,000 salmon babies will enter Daugavpils.
During the programme for the restoration of fish resources of AS Latvenergo, salmon and thyme cubs are introduced at Manga<0xC4><0xBC>salas in Daugavpils this week, and this year it is planned to introduce more than 600,000 annual salmon and thyme cubs raised by the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles.
LETA informed Latvenergo that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months - 6,300,000 baby fish and larvae of different species are introduced into the water bodies of the Daugava Basin each year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 will be released lichen and hare larvae, in June - sigas, in July - one-summer salmon, in August and September - sardines and vimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC5><0x86>ickis said that caring for the environment is one of the cornerstones of sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, every action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both in raising and introducing fish cubs into the Daugava basin and in carrying out other activities," said Kunickis.
This year, more than 600,000 year-old salmon and thyme babies will be released into the Daugava grotto.
For the second year, fish babies are marked before entering by cutting off the fatty spores.
The cargo brought today contains 25,000 salmon cubs with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, the introduction of fish cubs and caterpillars into the water bodies of Daugavpils and its basin takes place in a scientifically based species composition and numerically.
The increase of fish resources in Daugavpils and its catchment area shall be carried out by Bior, in accordance with the laws and regulations, on the basis of an expert assessment of the losses to fish resources resulting from Latvenergo’s economic activity and by concluding on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the abundance of fish resources.
On the other hand, the State Environmental Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation on the basis of that expertise.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo under the fish recovery programme shall be EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the association "We fish" for the fifth year, will place 400 artificial fish spawning nests in Daugavpils near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>ile.
Cooperation with the association in the promotion of natural fish husbandry is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo within the framework of the programme for the restoration of fish resources.
The placement of artificial turf nests in the water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugavpils.
In the festival "Sansus<0xC4><0xAB> Concert Hall" there is a country courtyard, forest, cirsma.
Guli tent, eat like in a restaurant, walk around and listen to investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which invites you to the Aknistes region for the third summer.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former parish house in Sus<0xC4><0x97>ja - a village that no longer exists.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - on five stages you can combine the carefree enjoyment of nature and academic music.
Here you will find music theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the rigidity of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on the face and ease of walking only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the true taste of Sansussi can be captured only by spending all three days in it," invites the festival's initiator and host, opera baritone Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The festival gates will be open on Friday at 17.00 and the first concert will be at 19.00.
Of course, there will be on-site programs with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend a Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9:00 a.m. until the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
There are, for example, violinist Eva Binder, cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpetist J<0xC4><0x81>nis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even an Estonian choir with an Estonian air.
New works have also been created especially for the festival.
In the play "Kukainis" for children, composed by O<0xC4><0xBC>esja Kozlovska and J<0xC4><0x93>kabs N<0xC4><0xAB>manis, together with Armands Silinis, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (puppets researcher) U<0xC4><0xBC>is Piter<0xC4><0x81>ns.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> composed the first String Quartet, while Anna <0xC4><0x8C>irse - Wooden Opera, performers whose main characters will be trees in three small pudures in a three-hectare wide calcareous forest, directed by Andra Kalnozola, with video projections by Catherine Neiburg and Andra Egl<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0xA1>’s scenography.
Singing in the voices of Laima Ledina, Dinara Rud<0xC4><0x81>ne and Zigm<0xC4><0x81>ras Gra<0xC5><0xA1>a, they will enter into romantic relationships, just like the Swedish scientist of the Enlightenment Karl Linnaeus in the study of the Tree Wedding (1729).
Today, one of the greatest hopes of the Latvian delegation, seven-fight athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admini<0xC5><0x86>a, starts the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a at 15.35 after Latvian time will start the race in 100 meters barrier race, but at 16.50 expected race in high-climbing.
In addition, during the night on Saturday at 2.35 p.m., the ball will start rolling, while at 4.05 p.m. - 200 m sprints.
The seven-fight race will be concluded on Saturday, when there will be long-distance skiing, shooting and an 800-meter race.
Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a, who won bronze in the World Championships last year, was mentioned as a contender for the Olympic Games medals.
In May, Latvia set a new national record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-fight competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidina also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with a repeat Latvian record.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the national record four times.
Today at 16 o'clock the start is also planned for Latvian judo fighter Artur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, first of all fighting with Azerbaijani athlete U<0xC5><0xA1>angi Kukauri.
This will be the first Olympic Games for Judists.
The Agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday in the weight category up to 100 kilograms of loss already experienced in his first fight the Latvian judo fighter Yevgeny Borodavko.
He joined the Japanese team of Hagu Rjunoski, who later won bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zelonijs brought the Olympic bronze award to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic Games Latvian judists won only one victory in seven fights together, which was achieved in London by Borodavko.
At 16.30 after the Latvian time, Dainis Upelnieks will start shooting at the qualifying stand, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The winner of the Olympic road sign received only on the day when the composition of the Latvian delegation was officially announced, however, he later revealed to the LETA agency that he had been quite confident about driving since April.
At the place of the Olympic Games, the athlete became one of the first Latvian athletes, trying to make the most of training opportunities in the shooting arena.
At 19.05, the debutant of the Olympic Games, Ketija Birzule, a 17-year-old Latvian sailor who competed in sailing for the Sundays in the RS:X class, will make three trips after the Latvian time.
After three days or nine trips Birzule in the overall rating among 26 athletes is now in 25th place.
The final race for the medals will take place on Saturday.
Today, it is finally planned to take part in the competition in the academic competition, where the representative of Ireland Sanitas Pu<0xC5><0xA1>puras from Latvia will take part.
On Wednesday, the competition was cancelled due to inclement weather.
Pu<0xC5><0xA1>pure at 19.10 will compete in the C/D semi-final for the only ladies, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, she won fourth place in the quarter-finals, from third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for the medal, lagging behind by 0.65 seconds.
Pushpure won 13th place in London four years ago, when she also represented Ireland.
Today, the Olympic Games will feature 24 medal sets - archery, athletics, trekking, jogging, spinning, trampoline jumping, judo, academic rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis and weightlifting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, then she will appoint Garland as the judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will nominate Merika Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the next president will choose who will replace current Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, during his conference, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A representative of Reid later said that he had not personally discussed the issue with Clinton and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team did not want to "shake the boat" with another choice.
Garlands is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for Colombia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "instruments" and were acting in the interests of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump is not fit for the job of president.
Treats announce the kailfot calendar for women and men.
Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar in the style of the 70s of the last century.
In its 2017 NU Music Calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels, not naked celebrities.
At the beginning of this year, Treats magazine President Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy, because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's also talking about the calendar.
In a press release about the creation of the calendar, Shaw writes: "We need to return to the depiction of immutable and classic nudity, where the body of women does not soften, but inspires both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can send their photos electronically or in person to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video review
Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nilsens says that the longevity record belongs to a woman who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French court rejected the request to demolish the shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected a request from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle Camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At a court hearing in Kale this week, authorities indicated that the state should rent 72 self-made shops, where people in the territory of the camp market various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, make tea for 50 cents (40p) and make simple meals for themselves.
The prefect’s office in Kale noted that these self-created enterprises need to be shut down because they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as pose fire and health risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small enterprises are important because the food provided by the government and the support groups does not meet the needs of the camp, in which the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who had set up 72 self-made shops, but it understood the prefect’s concerns in Kale.
Justice Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely unsightly conditions".
He pointed out that these places are a peaceful meeting place for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language lessons and provides counselling on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable minors without adult accompaniment.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Aid for Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, announced that the number of residents of the Jungle Camp has increased to 9,000 people, the highest figure since the rapid migrant inflow in the summer.
The United Kingdom won silver in the regbie-7 series, when the Fijian state won the gold medal.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the reggae-7 series ended on Thursday, when the state team of Rio Fidzi, in an exciting final at Deodoro Stadium, convincingly defeated them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in ball management, balls are played with the foot, support in the game and brutal force in the game, winning the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
Sak<0xC4><0x81>ve brought a worthy consolation prize - a silver medal, which was then the third medal of the United Kingdom. The British team can boast of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they competed in New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the heavy semi-final, in which the Boxing team suffered a 7:5 defeat in the first half of the day, they may have played in the final for the United Kingdom.
But in any case, the Fiji national team is now in its best form to win a team of 15 men.
While unlikely, a known consolation for the UK could be the fact that at least one Briton has won a gold medal. This is Fiji’s head coach Ben Rayens – a former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Raien's leadership, they lost all matches in the regby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The sarcasm is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started the match, defying the tactics of the British force joy after.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like a collision with several buses running against each other, and the World Series champions took the lead with 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau got the first ground.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his lead even more by landing on the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team did not even really touch the ball.
Mitchell's excellent strength did not allow the typical Leoni Nakarava to score three points, but this only slightly influenced the result of Fiji.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua gained a right-hand corner, strengthening his dominance over the United Kingdom to 17:0.
After the game, Nakarava increased his dominance even more and by the end there was more than a minute left... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some of the awkward British force tactics and crossed the line, gaining points.
The grounding gave the result 29:0.
It turned out that Fiji was born to play rugby-7 matches while the British were still learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made major changes in the half-time, breaking the Fiji players' line... the full four minutes, which was good by the standards of the first half, until the moment when Joshua Tuysova, after a fantastic team match, got a few more points in favor of the Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by making a left-hand landing and reaching a score of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while fans of the South Sea salt flats sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
You cannot fail to admire Fiji’s lively attitude.
Mata William made Fiji's victory even sweeter with another grounding at the end of the game.
When playing the final whistle, Fiji could begin to celebrate, but after the defeat, the British were only able to sit in the hall.
In the first half of the day, Fiji beat Japan by a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very fierce battle both teams won by ground and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half, Kyle Brown put the Box in charge of the team, but in the second half, Dens Norton with brilliant mastery crossed the line and delivered the ball between the poles, ensuring the British victory.
Markus Watson, who is the brother of England rugby-15 team player Antonia, a great power technique at the end of the game ensured the team a win and another silver medal.
The coach’s battle with cancer was inspired by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning’s victory in the Irish race.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last turn, the golden moments of Helena Glover and Heather Staning were of particular importance in the Estacio da Lagoa circuit.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by the voice of Robin Williams, who inspired her to win even the second Olympic gold medal in the pairing of women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
She undoubtedly dominated, as she won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
Both great athletes with the elegance of a swan skipping over the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medal won stands a whole team that works hard to continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was made by a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know whether he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can operate and it also happened.
If it were not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was fortunate that William was able to start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-season and reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if that can be said.
I needed an income, so I had to recover quickly.
This stimulated the recovery.
I was in the hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 meters long distances, although the doctor said that would be enough with a few steps.
That's how it all started.
Irrigation in itself is a challenge, but this time it was even greater.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very worried all morning and spoke more than usual under the impression of excitement.
Staning, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This has been an emotionally tough week, but it means a lot to me."
This only confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robins have worked.
The 3 years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Staning have not lost in any race in five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed with which the competitor can not compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, the predominance of Staning and Glover was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no high hopes.
On that day, we had no intention of breaking records, but simply to do well in the race and win, and so did we.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and the television adventure seeker Steve Bachal.
For the time being, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

“I’m not going to do that,” he said.
According to him, it is already "principally important" for Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inskis (Green and Farmers' Union) and Finance Minister Danai Reizniece-Ozolas (Green and Farmers' Union) that the candidates nominated by the Finance Minister to the post of Head of the VID be approved by Kol<0xC4><0x97>govo.
Rajevskis believes that both Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inskis and Reiznieces-Ozolas' approval of the VID leader in this government is the "first big decision" that can affect his future as a politician.
If now begins to change the position of the head of the VID in the selection of the candidate, then it will negatively affect their image in the state administration.
The agenda of the next week’s meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of the Head of the State Enterprise Kolegov to the post of Director General of the State Enterprise Enterprise, the government’s agenda shows.
The head of the VID was headed by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of In<0xC4><0x81>ra Peterson from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of Director General of VID ended without result.
In the interview on Thursday, 11 August, Latvian Radio allowed Dace Pel<0xC4><0x93>k<0xC4><0x81> to run for the post of head of the VID - if she were offered to run for the post of head of the VID, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance, however, later acknowledged that other candidates for the post of Head of the MED are not being considered for the time being.
The head of the Saeima faction of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledged that NA is still supporting the leadership of Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egov VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the failure to establish a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) came to the conclusion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the level of the budget deficit to the required 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro area.
Estimates show that, despite austerity measures, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain it was 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the foreseeable future.
One of the reasons why the EC did not, however, impose sanctions against the two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such a negative mood.
Critics point out, however, that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in life.
Thus, for example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Weidmann, pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, giving citizens the idea that European Union rules are recommendive rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for the correction of the budget deficit until the end of this year for Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to review the progress achieved by both countries in the coming months, while noting that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures, if the circumstances so require.
The initial projections show that Portugal's target could be achieved within the set timeframe and already this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention to controlling the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP per year over the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the formation of a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and the possibility of Spain having to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year is increasing.
However, public opinion polls show that the political scene of the third election in the country would not change significantly either.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose vote would again receive an incomplete 33% of the vote.
The popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsons" have slightly increased only by socialists, while against austerity measures the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsons" has slightly decreased.
The People's Party wants to achieve the involvement of socialists and "Ciudadanos" in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the draft budget for 2017.
As Rafael Hernando, a representative of the People's Party parliamentary group, said, if the government fails to form and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a mockery of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for five years, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found every year is increasing, and the majority of bathing site visitors are to blame here.
The most polluted bathing places are in Riga.
In the City Council, it is explained that swimming places are being cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, the waste left on land can be washed into the water during the rainy season, thus greatly impairing its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and some places in Kurzeme, beach cleanliness elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a statement was made this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
When measuring the path along the Gulf of Riga at the age of five, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year the criticality assessment has come into play.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters may possibly even exceed 200 units," says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
Called Latvijas Radio, he was on T<0xC5><0xAB>ja beach, where the volunteers will continue their walk along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, among the various household wastes and picnics leftover activists had to collect even daylight bulbs left in the floating sea sand.
The participant and organizer of the hike Ulme says that the pollution is directly responsible for the inhabitants.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, as more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the stage of demolition, they can no longer be identified, and exhausts, bottles, corks",
Among the dirtiest beaches there are also swimming spots in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, almost 800 waste units are collected every hundred meters on average, which is a critical amount.
The organizers of the campaign also explain that every step of the way, there are also mockery and not everywhere placed warning or prohibition signs.
"The average figures for all three bathing sites in Riga together - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>va, Vakarbul<0xC4><0xBC>i and Ve<0xC4><0x8D><0xC4><0x81><0xC4><0xB7>i - unfortunately meet high and far exceed the desired goal, which, as if Latvia is moving towards, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", concludes the environmental defender.
Cleaning bathing places in Riga every day, on the hottest days of the summer, even twice, explains the representative of the council U<0xC4><0xA3>is Vidauskis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural question of these people.
“For those who are fattening, drinking, smoking and doing all the things that can’t be done, even the special signs don’t work,” says Vidauskis.
That is why Vidauskis invites visitors to the swimming pool to report the pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and in this way fight everyone.
Perhaps you can impose some new warnings, but, as I said, it will hardly radically change the situation.
"How can we all, together, just turn around and be intolerant of such violators," he stresses.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites.
This year, however, as in other years, the water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that in all 56 bathing sites the water quality has always been good and there are no bathing restrictions.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says Normunds Kadikis, Senior Environmental Health Specialist at the Inspectorate.
During heavy rains, waste left on land can be rinsed in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite will continue - change of head in Putin's administration.
Do you lose your job?
Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave the post himself and will continue to be the president's special representative on nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin, in front of the television camera, dedicated the words of appreciation to Ivanov: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with the way you have carried out the duties entrusted to you.
I remember well our agreement not to use you as the head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I am sympathetic to your desire to change the field of action.
And I hope that in the new position you will make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanova one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the upcoming elections of the State Council in Russia next month, rumors have surfaced that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called a possible replacement for Putin in the post of president, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the position of the president's representative in the field of nature protection and transport created doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs is the general colonel of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his career in scouting in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
At the end of the reign of the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin, he was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanov was approved, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister of Defense of Russia, but already in 2005 - Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of companies in the defense sector of Russia and the export of weapons.
Now, after the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanovs will also retain his seat on the National Security Council of Russia, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
The fault comes from the elite of the family Soviet party.
The head of the presidential administration, Vaino, has been recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovi<0xC4><0x8D>s and I have known each other for a long time.
We have been in government under your leadership ever since.
And for the last almost five years, we've been in contact practically every day.
"Therefore, I am sure that according to all professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanovs said.
The fault comes from the family that belonged to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Karls took senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including being its first secretary for ten years until 1988.
Internet publication "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonian self-determination and independence" writes that at the end of the 80s Karls Vaino asked Moscow to give permission to use force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he has been refused and soon lost his post.
Soon after, Vaino moved to live in Moscow.
Antons Vaino has graduated from the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent weeks Russia has been shaken by the resignation and even arrest of several high-ranking officials, including the replacement of several governors and federal representatives.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the ruling elite ahead of the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - more and more representatives of the power structures are at the leading positions.
Also, the judo wrestler Nikiforenko loses the Olympic Games in the first fight.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has completed his participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
Coach O<0xC4><0xBC>egs Baskins told Latvian Television that there was very little hope for Nikiforenko, and this was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the Judo fighter suffered a shoulder injury in the fight.
Significantly, to get to the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani fighter was more than 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko in the fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Ryunosuki held for two and a half minutes, until the opponent managed to score a clean victory shot.
As a result, Latvia’s judo competition in Rio has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
Thursday was introduced by the jurist Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titular opponent against him, but the ambitious can sometimes provide a surprise.
He didn't.
The task of Artur Nikiforenko was even more difficult, because the experience is less and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although on the tatami he held the tea for a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, Latvia’s judokas have been lacking in ambition the most recently.
Since the leadership of the Federation passed Gun<0xC4><0x81>rs <0xC4><0x8C>irsons and his financial stooge Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>estakovs, from Latvia went Alexander Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>s, "Golden Score" no longer happens, - judo development runs along a downward curve.
Jackevich, who here advises the Kazakh Jews, and Vsevolod Zeluny does not see the heirs.
But if it doesn't grow, it won't.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to win medals was heard from another galaxy in the "Morning Panorama".
The flight is far from reality.
In the evening, with impatience and concern, we waited for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers game is over.
The Latvian duo had a slight deviation - could also lose, but not more than with four points in two sets.
The tension was further increased by the prolonged previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling above the wind map curved the entire length of the match.
For the players, the gust of wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be ours - which is more comprehensive - the ally.
But it didn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
Serves so much to Samoilov and wait for him to burst.
Against Canada fell, against Cuba broke the first set at the end and the third at the beginning, because the load was not in the way of a joke.
The man was able to fish at that time, because the work was small, but when it was done, it was done in honor.
The Brazilian Samoilovs and Smedin were able to win in two sets, as the first took the lead with 16:15, however, at 16 also remained, exhausting also the lost points limit.
But it was also possible to lose by 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third has already gone to Evandra's serf mark.
A chain was formed - an inconclusively received serve, the second pass often flew too close to the net and Samoilov left very little option for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilov against the Cubans in the field, then this time he acted more successfully, and only on Sasha to recount the loss would be unprofessional.
He also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, he hit the last ball in the block.
The team loses.
This time there was definitely a lack of success - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the ball still hit the line.
Two lanes were next to the line.
Also controversial episodes of the video decided in favor of opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra fought with the serfs, then against ours they were very productive.
All together, the loss on the board was summed up.
The causes of failure must now be calmly analysed.
Perhaps many should have lived next to the stadium, rather than with a delegation to the Olympic village.
Two and a half hours went by.
Perhaps a little self-confidence was given by the series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt should not have played, but come here faster and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a failure to find the top of the sports form.
We are waiting for more questions than answers.
The game is over for our bastards.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still a few World Cup tournaments left and also the Jurmala Masters.
In the life of Samoilov there have never been any friends and there will be no such ones, because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary either.
When the dream of Olympic medals is shattered, the thought of divorce can also arise, because the blame will be sought not only in yourself, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers play the river, but John and Tom have already tried and also parted ways, while Mikhail Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world's tops.
You can try to return to M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC4><0xBC>avi<0xC5><0x86>a by Harald Reg<0xC5><0xBE>i, Aleksandrs Solovej, Edgars To<0xC4><0x8D>i, but it will not be better than this option, which proved itself more than once in the World Cup stages.
This time the sand of Kopacabana did not make them smile.
And sure.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are entering the circulation, and only a rare height is less than two meters.
This does not yet guarantee success, but is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
Our spirits don't last long.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some of the tennis players do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some beach volleyball players have visited the hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, highly exaggerated prices were demanded for all the modest accommodation offered by journalists.
Therefore, the choice fell on the apartment rent.
The risk is because sometimes they can be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the borders of Kopakaban and Ipanema.
Beach 200 meters away, beach arena in a half-hour walk.
The area is quite safe, because the favelas are along, however, one should not lose vigilance here as well.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some people immediately think of, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. Looks like another dream of a medal was dreamed on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidin<0xC4><0xAB>na was behind her personal records in the 100-meter barrier race and high jump.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of break "Porgijs and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera Porgijs un Besa was premiered in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been re-introduced.
That is why the organizers of the C<0xC4><0x93>sis Art Festival and the Liepaja Art Forum decided, in close cooperation, to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy the masterpiece of George Gershwin.
"We are very happy that after a break of ten years, when the last time Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was able to enjoy an opera performance, this great version of George Gershwin's opera Porgijs und Besa is to be enjoyed with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Lielais aztars" in Baisal<0xC4><0x81>s.
Opera "Porgies and Bess" is a story about love, its inconsistency, passion, as well as the tragedies of life and simple everyday joys.
It reflects the African-American vitality, music, and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so vivid.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some ways really deep," says director Viesturs Kairiss.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stopping points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminating one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgijs un Besa" concert studio Andris Poga.
Opera visitors agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are very happy to hear this world-famous opera by Gershwin.
It is good that the world can breathe in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special in that the orchestra played for the first time in the orchestra pit in the newly opened concert hall "Lielais dzintars" and the opera concert performance took place for the first time.
The square near the Art Museum’s renovated building could be named after Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls.
The Deputy Mayor of Riga Andris Ameriks told at the opening of the Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l’s anniversary exhibition that the museum’s own address in the future could not be Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>nis Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ras Street 10a, but Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>l<0xC4><0x81>ls Square 1.
The director of the museum, M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address will create a significant bureaucratic burden, but in general, he welcomed this idea and therefore accepted the proposal of the local government.
The city of Riga has laid a kind of foundation stone for this idea in 1936, creating a monument to Janis Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls, who stands next to the museum.
The museum’s director, Wilhelm Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am a little bit of a conscience all the time - but Wilhelm Purv<0xC4><0xAB>tis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think about it," said the Bear.
It is reported that the building of the National Museum of Art, after extensive reconstruction and modernization, was officially opened in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace will finally begin.
The castle will be restored by SIA "Velve" for about 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two auditoriums, as well as to adapt the building for people with movement disorders.
The Riga City Council has planned to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from the European Union funds for the project, but O<0xC5><0x82>egs Burovs, Director of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, acknowledges that there is still no complete clarity on the European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the repair works of the VEF Culture Castle by attracting the European Structural Funds, is, we have been waiting for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether the money will be allocated or not," says Burov.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission saying that it was up to you to decide that Brussels was not taking a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussions is forming again, well, then we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
“I would like to say that the Riga City Council will no doubt guarantee that this process will be started and completed in time,” Burov said.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the renovation of the building immediately to be renovated.
Despite the passing of the year, the renovation of the building was still not started and the collective continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into apparently independent reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Cultural Palace and improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineeringcommunications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
Second - improvement of the VEF Culture Palace services offer.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, the restoration of walls and ceilings, the studio of stage and sound recordings, as well as to arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve the equipment of workshops, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" the legendary rock band can be seen in the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various "Live" objects - photographs arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010, when the end of the group's activities is announced.
The participants will also be shown costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings, as well as other things that have not yet been seen by the wider audience, which reflected the creative activity of the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi".
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from the Liepaja Museum collection.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
In addition, musicians who were associated with the group "Livy" and their relatives, responded to the invitation and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu" can be found in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitols, was created in the Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja House of Culture.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and the republic.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pavitols got acquainted with <0xC4><0x92>riku <0xC4><0xB6>i<0xC4><0xA3>eli and founded a group at the Metalurgi Culture Palace, inviting Ingr<0xC4><0xAB>da G<0xC5><0xAB>tmani, Andri Kr<0xC5><0xAB>zi<0xC5><0x86>u and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has moved more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their own way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - remained unchanged.
"What's missing is that jeans, furs and beards, these guys were noticeably different from the stereotype of the mainstream stage singer," says music observer Klass V<0xC4><0x81>vere.
Without the musicians mentioned above, such excellent musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC3><0xA2>rks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Semibarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars B<0xC5><0xAB>rze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others have performed in the band.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition will be open from 19 August to 30 October.
On the 27th of August in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja concert garden "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, v<0xC4><0xAB>ji<0xC5><0x86>i" will take place the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" 40th anniversary celebration "L<0xC4><0xAA>VIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months inflation is observed in Bulgaria.
In July, the Bulgarian national statistics showed a monthly inflation of 1%.
This is the highest since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation rate after PCI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.9% compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation rate was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate was -0.2% (in July 2016 compared to December 2015) and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); for housing, household appliances and regular household cleaning (0.5%); for health (0.1%).
Prices were maintained at the level of the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbigniew Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is coming back.
Zbigniew Stankevich, metropolitan archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, in an interview with the Independent, stresses that if we want to gain the strength of life, the Gospel message must be placed at its center.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the sky in Aglona.
What message will the faithful receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been expressed by the papal nuncio.
Therefore, the content of the main message is also in his mind.
It is also a kind of tradition to consider the fact that the Way of the Cross is led by the bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bulis.
He will also create his own message.
I lead a vigil service on the previous day.
Last year I turned to Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si and updated the theme of the common house, the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I have been watching what is happening in the world, and I try to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the Church’s recommendation that the Gospel be placed at the centre of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of a person’s life and gives him inspiration for the further journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lamp's discussion, you said that "return to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean by that?
Does this mean that a person avoids the message of the church?
And does the church today have a resource for such a return?
In the Indian capital, there was a dying man on the side of the road.
In the Indian capital, no one has heard of a man who died on the side of the road - it turns out that he spent an hour on the side of the road and then was robbed, reports the BBC.
It has been reported that a man identified as Matib<0xC5><0xAB>l rode a rickshaw during the day but worked as a guard at night.
When she got home at 5:30 a.m., she was hit by a light car.
The recording of the surveillance camera shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim, and then drove away.
After an hour, when no one knew about the man who was bleeding, he was robbed by a prawn.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died from the injuries.
When withdrawing his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the head of the State Environment Service Inga Kol<0xC4><0xAB>gova saved the government from falling, Oj<0xC4><0x81>rs Skudra, an associate professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia, believes.
Kol<0xC4><0x93>geva's explanation of the withdrawal of candidacy in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is related to the fact that she prevented the collapse of the government.
The panel in conversation with the agency LETA said that it was difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support Kolegov's candidacy.
Therefore, if the ministers of "Unity" voted against, but Kolegov was confirmed in office, it would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegov consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski.
At the same time, it is also a concession to the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether to succeed in finding a suitable candidate with the help of the tender, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to lead Dace in Grey as the executor of the Director-General's duties.
At the same time, he points out that if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that no other candidacy is being considered, it is a gesture to the Greyhound that he should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environmental Service Kolegov has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of VID.
Due to "Unity" objections, the government postponed Kolegov's approval to the post of Director General of VID on Tuesday for a week.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegov confirmed that he was still ready to become a CEO.
However, later thoughts changed - on Friday, in a presentation to Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she points out that she is withdrawing her consent to transfer to the post of Head of MED and this is not an easy choice for her.
The press secretary of the Prime Minister, M<0xC4><0x81>ra Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inska, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the post of vacant Director General of VID.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon, there was a road traffic accident involving a State Police car.
The police car with the sound and light signals switched on hastened to the highest category call, until at the intersection of Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>nis Barona and Dzirnavu Street collided with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force did not miss the police car.
A woman was injured in the accident.
This year, the number of inhabitants in Riga has decreased
At the beginning of this year there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered 641,000 inhabitants, the agency LETA informed the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th among the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and the big cities, where the population exceeds one million.
According to the data of the EU statistical office "Eurostat" in Riga has the largest share of women - the capital of Latvia is convincingly in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, while in Tallinn they are 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be placed at the LNMM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be displayed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), Baiba Gail<0xC4><0xAB>te, representative of the Property Department of the Riga City Council, told LETA.
The museum has successfully completed the repair of the glass rapid damage resulting from the work of the skateboarders.
In the coming days, warning pictograms will be placed next to it.
Its inhabitants will be told that the cover tends to be slippery in the rain and snow, it should not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, skates and skateboards.
On that social network "Facebook" also wrote at that time Ushakov, who indicated that no security threats are caused by the damage, but "looks inaccurate", and the skateboarders "will have to die".
Festival for children and parents- New children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
During this summer season, the Riga municipality has even installed two new playgrounds in the city, in Kipsala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkaln, which are now available for children.
<0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB>psala beach is equipped with a large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, games, pipes and slides.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The area is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The world of fantasy for small sailors is illuminated by the location of the attraction on the Daugava coast with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships visible there.
On the other hand, the playground between the 4th and 5th intersections of <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns has a playhouse, a trampoline, a step-up track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other game elements, as well as a gymnasium with circles for strength and coordination training, parallels, etc.
Under the surface covered rubber cover in different colors.
To the playground on the street side there is a new, colorful cobblestone cover.
The reconstructed section of the road has been opened in Meduma.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of construction companies SIA "Binders" and representatives of municipalities of Lithuania today unveiled the reconstructed main highway of Russia (Grebneva) -Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lithuva border (Mee<0xC5><0xBE>a) from 13 km.
Roads are a national calling card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the fact that, thanks to the co-financing of European Union funds, the situation on the country's main roads is improving.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be acquired as early as 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to keep the busiest roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," he said.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts for sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
Construction works in the period from Medum to the Lithuanian border (156.4-163.05 km) Ltd. Binders started last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The reconstruction costs are <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed section of the road, the road structure has been completely restored and next year repairs will be started in the next section from Medum to Daugavpils itself, so the whole road from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils will be arranged," said J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the LVC Board.
The country’s main roads are the busiest, and by 2018 we plan to make sure that all the country’s main roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, providing timely periodic maintenance and make a replacement of the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"It will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers are looking forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange said.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the center of Medum have been arranged.
Substantial earthworks were carried out: large-scale re-watering in four stages and extensive excavation and excavation work, a leveled longitudinal profile of the road, which was so far very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a new roundabout for public transport has been built.
Before the road had insufficient carrying capacity and the surrounding terrain was not visible due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the highway section from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstructed section (144,80.-156,40. km).
This year LVC plans to carry out various types of works on more than 1100 kilometers of national road.
Information about all the repairs planned in the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right combination of food products", admits Lithuanian dietician Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easily done in the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of diet products can help not only to reduce excess weight, but also to purposefully promote various processes of the body.
Pasta and vinegar is a successful combination, as it provides a long-lasting satiety and helps fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that etiquette has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel dizzy.
A dish rich in cayenne pepper and proteins, such as poultry meat or a protein cocktail, not only creates a feeling of satiety, but also reduces cravings for large meals in future meals.
Such a combination of foods is able to increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdominal area.
Eggs contain a nutrient that promotes metabolism - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
By taking in sufficient amounts of this nutrient, you can reduce cortisol levels, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
Oatmeal porridge, to which fresh berries are added, is another delicious and fat-burning meal for breakfast, which is worth including in your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber that, according to the findings of Canadian scientists, controls ghrelin - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling of hunger.
In addition, berries contain polyphenols, which are helpful in weight loss, as well as prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins are also capable of performing miracles in weight loss.
Such a combination is able to create a sense of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so it promotes the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestion process and provide a satiety feeling for a longer time.
At lunchtime, you can eat chicken with salad or prepare a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch found in vegetables is a polysaccharide.
The fruits are mechanically divided in the stomach, while chemically they do not divide until they reach the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that occurs in the intestines.
Solids are divided into three different stages, which begin already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat sweet food immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet meal immediately after a meal, it is "caught" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products together with lemons, luck, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptyalin, found in saliva, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids not only inhibit the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promote their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and combinations of milk and protein-rich products in one meal.
Their processing requires a variety of digestive juices, each of them with different strengths, characteristics and the time to enter the stomach.
Watermelon, honeymelon, muscatmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with solids, however, the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid the use of fat altogether.
This also applies to refreshment - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with a whole avocado (contains fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to cook?
"Food preparation, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products," says the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by boiling food products in water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods increases when cooked directly.
After cooking the vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soup - in this case, you will not lose nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to prepare vegetables, including by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When you boil tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene, which is found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the proteins present in them, making them easier to digest.
Similarly, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in this product more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, although fiber freezing does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-blood-forming iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than blood-forming iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-haemorrhagic iron in the body by using non-haemorrhagic iron-containing products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes, and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-haemorrhagic iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen delivery to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of salads, add healthy fats like olive or linseed oil to them.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add with vitamin D to a salmon or sardines-rich yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an important role in the formation of bones.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) along with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, raspberries, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of the arteries.
Snapchat's "Anime" effect criticized for Asian cartooning
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racially insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change reality and play with their identity in a completely absurd way.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that fits into the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are foggy, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million converted selfies per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes visible to the public.
Snapchat’s lens effects have already been criticized in the past, receiving hype that the app is popularizing too blackish or light-skinned skin tones as the ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to form dish eyes, disheveled teeth and round faces, and some critics called it a racist Asian caricature of the “yellow germ”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials erupted on Wednesday when editions of The Verge and Motherboard reported that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the goal of the lens is to depict Anime images, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
However, for people who have experienced racism, these effects reminded of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
A Twitter post about the images by Korean-American art student Greisa Sparapani gained wide resonance. In an e-mail she points out that the lens effects are "insulting and uncomfortable not to say more".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the similarity between the Asian cartoons and the lens effects visible to the eyes.
This shows that the effect of the lens is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat’s large youth audience, representing different races, unlike its parent population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today, such things do not go unnoticed", said 25-year-old Katie Zhou in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, <0xC5><0xBD>ou, product manager at Medium, deleted his Snapchat app and advised others to do the same.
In her article Medium and in a telephone interview, she explained that, in her opinion, race-related problems arise because of Snapchat’s employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with the reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, which is why such decisions are allowed. Do some representatives of other races work in the company, but they do not take up such a position to be able to express their opinion safely and comfortably", believes the American of Chinese origin Zhou.
Her views are also shared by others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a staff specialist who will focus on also representing racial minorities in the company, which are not widely represented and will contribute to the company’s inclusion.
Zhou did not renew his Snapchat account, adding: "Interestingly, they really need more users like us to understand that this is not the right thing to do."
The House of Congress reports that military officials have distorted reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Congress said representatives of the U.S. Central Command had distorted the reports, portraying the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it actually is.
Central Command Intelligence Analysts express their general displeasure with the interim report of the Task Force set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense Financing of the Republican Representatives, indicating that their leadership controlled the reports of American advances in the Wall.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report says that intelligence reports, approved by the leaders of high-ranking Centcom, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts were regularly distorted, showing better achievements than other intelligence reports.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said: "Centcom's action is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policymakers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report presents in detail the existing challenges in the Central Command's reflection and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration would have caused the reports to be distorted, it does show that Centcom’s management has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the releases, announcements and reports of the Central Administration’s press presented the situation to Congress in a significantly more positive light than it actually was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
In his report, Michael Pompeo, a representative of the Kansas Republican Party, said: "The months-long investigation clearly proves this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Central Administration chiefs distorted the reports, portraying the threat of ISIS in Iraq as weaker than it actually was.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts were concerned that information about the Islamic State was being distorted.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in the case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
The members of the Democratic Party on Thursday published their own report, in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party’s working group.
In his report, Democrat Representative Adams B. Schiff said that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom over-restricted intelligence assessment reports on ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schiff explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the work ethic of analysts and "spread facts that are not true."
But Schiff and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had pressured Centcom analysts to draft reports in line with "a pre-determined or political stance."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s inspector general had launched an investigation into Centcom’s claims.
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Agency are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year’s accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on Central Administration reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Critics of the Islamic State's intelligence recall more than a decade-old events when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Huker published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration initiated the Afghan war with too little thought about its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State's intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that the Huker team found that, contrary to public reports, air raids on Islamic State oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group, because they had built temporary factories to sell oil.
In a September issue of The Times, it was reported that the discovery did not go beyond the walls of the Central Administration.
At the time, Commander-in-Chief of Centcom, General Lloyd Austin III, received sharp criticism, as many law-makers felt that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin took a leave of absence and General Joseph L. Votels took his place.
In the U.S. duel with the U.K. in the women's field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus winning already the fourth victory in a row.
The day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday Katie Bama won the first two goals in favor of the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans took over the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bama said that you can not remember whether such a thing would have ever worked for her.
She said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who counts their goals.
But she knows that the result of the Americans at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group undefeated with the United Kingdom, which on the fourth day after the victory over Japan with the result 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last matches of the first round of the games.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which team will take the second.
The winner of the first place will avoid a meeting with the strong Dutch national team, which is the leader of the second group for a little longer.
Despite the fact that Saturday’s game did not take place, the Americans have already caused a surprise storm, taking the last place among the 12 teams in London four years ago.
Bama was also on that team.
She grew up in Bluebelt, took a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already involved in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest player in the team.
She was not at the 2008 Olympics because she did not make it to the finals.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The next year, England coach Craig Parham was appointed and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
We didn’t invest as much in London as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
Thursday's game Bama revealed the result, catching the goal in the first half with a back shot from a close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their selection was very severe and kept the minimum score 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama again won the goal.
She entered the ball into the opponent's zone on the left side of the field, then noticed that she was in the middle of the field and sent the ball to the opponent's gate, placing the Americans in the lead 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales scored another goal.
This was the first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs' dry game, with one goal in each of the first three games.
She's in.
And so does Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," Paham said, but how exactly well the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing meal of the depression period is the "Satisfied Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after being elected president, Franklin D. Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office to hold a meal.
President Ruzvelt tasted such fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pastry or fuagra and Maryland turtle soup.
However, at that time his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato chips and in dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelman says, "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard on themselves."
Her husband Andrew Cowe adds: "It's also a message to Americans how they should eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
Kou's latest book, Vegetable Sautéing, describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane in her book, "97 Apples," describes life through the dining room at the Manhattan East Downstairs.
Their new joint work, The Nutty Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Demonstrating some solidarity in the culinary field, they held a meal together at the reporter's "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple dining room located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929, when the Great Depression began.
Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives, while Mr. Kou, 57, ordered turkey, potato chips and vegetable salads.
When a reporter ordered a fake bunny, the couple admitted that his choice is very much in line with the conversation about the Great Depression-era food.
Ziegelmane said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut bunny, a liver bunny and a bean bunny.
They were made from the main ingredient and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they should be instead of lunch.
Mr. Kou was displeased.
"It must have seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat for their male workers, and freshly prepared sachets were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who sent food to the Europeans. The "saturated meal" described how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America suddenly was no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the main focus of the American people's daily lives," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on the topic.
New budget diets became just as important: unknown foods such as fake rabbit and oatmeal became commonplace, oatmeal was "a great way to use leftovers," noted Mrs. Ziegelmane, because cooks could hide unattractive ingredients under the bush.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient in American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, new, unseen formations were born.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelman found a recipe for making peanut butter-filled onions.
Mr Kou added: "This was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs Ziegelmane said: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible.
Many home-cooked recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of the Economy of Households from 1923 to 1943, determined the state’s eating habits, which had not occurred either before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and take on challenges such as turning pasta and carrots into a delicious meal.
"Sat<0xC4><0xAB>g<0xC4><0x81> Mal<0xC4><0xAB>te" is a feast of historical delights.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as President Herbert H<0xC3><0xBC>ver's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he told the public about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, in fact he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like a fish with a cucumber sauce."
He eats in an almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleonora had not advised him to set an example by his eating habits.
The book tells us that Roosevelt helped a domestic servant who was not taught how to cook, thus the White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most odious dishes in Washington, but also the worst-cooked dishes."
As soon as the national economy recovered, most of the depression era culinary traditions disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as how to apply science in cooking, added Mrs Ziegelmane.
The couple says that when they wrote the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," Mr. Kou said.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "She was actually teasing people."
Once there was an incident with wind cakes.
When we had eaten in Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert out of the bag: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"It's plum-scented," said Mrs. Ziegelman, adding that it was a common practice at the time to name modest dishes.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They were all impatiently soaked in the brown mass of the spoons, which were on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t that bad.
Mr. Kou is eating some more cumos.
Hearing from an experienced "economist", he said to his wife: "Do a pinch of salted hazelnut."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for the patent of Hepatitis C
The district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to recover the costs of legal services it paid in the case of the patent infringement of Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for the breach of two Merck patents that threatened her in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a U.S. federal judge found violations of Merk’s activities, such as swearing-in lying and other unethical activities.
During Thursday’s hearing, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Freeman said Gilead has the right to seek compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to gain market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was initiated as early as 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is a key component of Gilead’s medicines.
The US-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken control of the northern city of Manbij on the Turkish border and the last Islamic State fighters have left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) is currently cleaning up the city from the last of the opposition fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages captured by the militants, Sarfan Darvi<0xC5><0xA1> of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters news agency.
"The city is now fully under our control and we are searching for fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 reached $10.75 million and the pair paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, the Clintons have donated $1 million, mainly to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, acting as a gossiper and former Secretary of State earned $3 million in revenue from the Wall Street Journal.
U.S. Senator Tim Keane and his wife, Anna Holtone, have released their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Keane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind various traps and distractions so that he does not have to fulfill promises to reveal his tax information.
Public disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for U.S. presidential candidates, but is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move," the Democratic Party's candidate said on Twitter, according to Clinton campaign partner Ian Sams.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release tax information until the audit was complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican Party presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, argue that his refusal raises questions about his true wealth, donation amounts, and other business commitments, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton poured oil on the fire by releasing a video on Friday, in which several influential Republicans ask Trump to release his tax information.
She returned to this issue again during an economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico reports that Trump paid very little or no taxes during the 1990s, and the New York Times columnist said Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today either.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Warren Buffett’s proposal, popularizes the idea that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett called on Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he too is being audited by the Revenue Service and that Trump is afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappell, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises hotel in Berlin for disconnecting Israeli teleprompter code at some Arab request - RT News
The director of French films of Jewish origin raised a storm on social media when he discovered that the Israeli telegraph code is not available in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin. The hotel’s staff bases this on the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, the director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, did not hide his dissatisfaction with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent visit, Lancmans tried to find a list of the Telsarunu hotels in Israel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was ravaged and destroyed?
Written by Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer received "shocked him".
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a conscious decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code irritated the film director even more.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancmans quoted a hotel employee as saying.
The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
The same is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is an even greater humiliation.
There is no need for explanations.
The official said: "We hope the hotel will come to the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply a waste of money for Arab customers.
Another entry said that the hotel was located on Kurfurstendamm Street, next to the synagogue.
The Der Spiegel edition states that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all overtures, stating that this is all "understanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of countries' numbers," the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And add that the code is again added to the list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student-police clash took place on Thursday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against the reforms of the government’s education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas against the students.
The problems began when the guards tried to exterminate the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to show their distaste for the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools with the aim of saving money.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against the interim president, Michael Temer.
This protest came just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to express support for the late President Dilma Rousseff, whose impeachment was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kelms Skinner at the finish line first to bring Britain a gold medal in cycling
Kelum Skinner of Scotland finished the first men's cycling team in a sprint race at Rio last night. The British team defended their champion title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making a proud legendary Scotsman, Sera Chris Hoy, and setting New Zealand’s favorites to victory.
Four years ago, Britain won an astonishing victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, even though Hoy had already finished his sports career.
The problems were in the phase between the Beijing and London Olympics, because they had to replace the experienced starter specialist Jamie Staf.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoy left, he tried to fill his place with Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The British coach put his hopes on Skinner, seeing in him the potential that he also later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - champions, who four years ago started with Hoya and Skinners, who set the Olympic qualifier record, but the race was a better start for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hinds were close in their circle, Kenya took the lead, and Skinners guarded the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes drove with a higher gear to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys observed the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenya and Hindesa as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old said, "It was an unspeakable compliment."
I do my best to defend my name.
In the final, we set an Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoya at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a failed start.
He later refuted this comment, and the British competitors were not in a position to prove otherwise.
This time there was no such incident.
Hinds said, "The British flag in the tribunes recalled London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be won by a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya's performance, he could indeed repeat Hoya's success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, it would mean six gold medals and one silver medal. In addition, Kenya was born on March 23 (it seems that it is a British sacred date, because on this day also Steve Regreev, Mo Farah and Roger Banister were born).
Hoys was also born on this date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Right now I just enjoy it all.
The journey of a team is always the best.
Because then you can win together with the team members.
If you are honest, then winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
On that day, it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Vigin, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owen Doyle showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometer race.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record that was set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigin will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip he had disagreements with the commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
In the women's tour, which will continue and conclude today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavija set a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team, hopefully, will win medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Recalling the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, there have been various behind-the-scenes, accusations of sexism and abuse of dignity, technical director Shayne Sutton resigned, and Hoys and Victoria Bendleton also end their careers.
However, starting with the first race of the race, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of Portland's melting pot is becoming unclear as an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of the aluminium smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of the cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Government of Victoria to discontinue the subsidisation of an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alkoas Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unpredictable side effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of all Victoria’s electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station.
Alkoas Portland's melting plant is working with losses and may be closed.
These events were triggered by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of factory production.
The plant’s energy supplier, AGL, which supplies power from its Loy Yang A power station in Latroubes Valley, says the other three owners are also likely to end their contracts.
Most of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia joint ventures and, in addition to the shares, by the holding companies of China CITIC and Japan Marubeni Corp.
"AGL is looking forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further energy supply to the melting plant," its representative said.
AGL announced that the contracts are so-called "risk-mitigating contracts", which are expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in fiscal year 2017 as well," the company's representative said.
With effect from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
AGL claims that it has already calculated losses of $187 million in its forecasts, with the expectation that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue its operations or to supply it with energy.
The US company says that in 2010 it signed a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be terminated. The company does not provide an explanation why it will cease cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland meltdown in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, the sector's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that analysts estimate that 600 megawatts of energy and 900 megawatts of energy are used in Portland during the year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, the energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Each year, more than 160 000 people's demands are rejected, and the situation could deteriorate as the budget is reduced.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight against illegal posting - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only get worse with a reduction in funding.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than before.
The Director of the Queensland Legal Centre, James Farrel, said that the latest report from the Association of National Legal Centres says that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farrel pointed out that if this decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The legal centre in Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that help is being denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end a violent relationship, people with deep debts, families who are divorced, workers who are unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders will have to tackle their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately halt the funding cut so that people in need of legal aid can get it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to also pay attention to the needs of the local communities and their customers, and to invest in this important area by the Government of Palazchuk.
Donald Trump’s campaign is being sued because one of the employees pulled out a firearm
NEW YORK (AP) — Organizers of Donald Trump’s campaign are suing the court for failing to act on information that its North Carolina operations chief will turn a gun on an employee when they drove a car in February.
This incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordini, a former campaign programmer, in Charlotte's court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months for an internal review of the case to be initiated, but realized that it would not happen.
Head Earl Phillips "drawn out the gun, put his right index finger on the cock and turned the barrel towards Vincent's side of the road", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before this case was filed, the Republican Party candidate for president caused a scandal by telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act in the event that the election would be won by his rival Hilary Klin.
Representatives of the Trump campaign announced that the media had taken his words out of context, and he had never urged anyone to violence.
Bordini with his claim wants to recover compensation from the organizers of the campaign for negligent surveillance, but from Filipsa - for the attack, the illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump’s representative, Houpa Hicks, did not immediately comment.
Unable to contact Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
Also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has been running a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - the festival of parish and sports in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
On Saturday in <0xC4><0xB6><0xC5><0xAB>lciems for the first time people gathered at the parish and sports festivals.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that the celebration of the Lake will no longer be.
The new page has now been moved.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, shotguns had to be fired at a sleeping target, the boot flew, with a man's left hand throwing, "bubbles" have not been at all in any Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, brave, agile and resilient he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered on the outdoor stage, where the parish festival began.
At the same time, there was also a "children's corner", where children could go to the inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face makeup shop.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was the motor show, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
All were addressed by the head of the administration of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciems parish Inga Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>e-Skadi<0xC5><0x86>a, who wanted a nice rest and dry weather, but the rain still poured, but it was not able to disturb much.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest residents of <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciems.
It is really good that the parish has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With performances at <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xBC><0xC4><0xBC>ciemnieki there were amateur art collectives from Engure region - the audience really liked the performances of senior dance group "Audens Rhythm", various folk dance performers "Reda" and youth dancers "Zelta p<0xC4><0x93>rles" (Golden Pearls).
And it's not that on the wet stage someone also happened to slip.
Of course, the famous actor duo J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jar<0xC4><0x81>ns and Dainis Porgants, who again were Mildi<0xC5><0x86>a Nabina and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86>a, as well as the attractive wives of B<0xC4><0x93>rzciems from the fishermen’s farm “Dieni<0xC5><0x86>as”, brought joy to the local people and guests.

The United Kingdom needs to maintain the Olympic spirit and expand H<0xC3><0xBC>ttrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Khytrov will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work to ensure that all regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford-upon-Avon and Austen won an enormous amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities near H<0xC3><0xBC>ttrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put a stop to youth unemployment in the vicinity of Heathrow.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be people this time who think that this challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global disaster.
The skeptics were wrong about 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Khytrova has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Khitrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the whole society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, with an economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
A great team is working in Heathrow, which has created an infrastructure investment programme worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, including time and budget, starting with Terminal 5, which for five years has been named the best airport terminal in the world and ending with Terminal 2, which is built between two ramps of intensive use.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure that this will also be the case with the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow by providing our trading future and creating a new employment environment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the board of directors of Heathrow and a former secretary of commercial affairs of the Ministry of Economy.
In Switzerland, a woman climbs on a highway, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, the victim fell on the highway.
The police are trying to find witnesses to the accident, when on Thursday morning on the highway she drove over several cars.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The cantonal police report said that the woman had stumbled on the road in the dark, where she was being hit by several cars, desperately wanting to commit suicide.
While clearly trying to kill himself, the victims, a 49-year-old Swiss man, crashed several machines, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but others involved have not yet been identified, police say, calling for the recall of the involved drivers and witnesses to the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been launched in the case, which is a logical step in such a case, the publication Le Tribune de Geneve was told by the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers adds: "This will be clarified by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held responsible.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone on a highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be in the middle of the night on the highway, the newspaper reports.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of murder for inattentiveness when, in August 2014, she drove a man who was sleeping in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernes.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman who was on her way to the scene of the accident was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge found that the sleeping man on the way was a "completely unpredictable and extraordinary case".
Anyone with information about the accident that occurred near Morges on Thursday is invited to contact the police by phone on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are collected for the holding of a new post of the head of the VID.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" started collecting signatures for the holding of the competition of the new Head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS), states that the public wants a transparent and professional process of appointing officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova as the VID Director-General is opaque and unprofessional.
This brings to mind the best traditions of Soviet officials.
This discredits the state administration and, once again, causes the public to despair of the government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the petition text reads.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egova’s election to the post.
It is also not clear what the candidate’s intentions are for the work of the VID.
The petition states that the State Chancellery must create a new, open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists are attracted and appropriate remuneration is offered.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Kolegov as the head of the VID, this week it was planned to approve him in the government in the new office, but all the ministers of the "Unity" party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, then I played badly.
Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> were hoping for an award at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, however, without getting to it, there is no difference where to conclude the competition, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the strongest beach volleyball pairs in the world on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-group tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to the Brazilians Evandra Gonsalve<0xC5><0xA1> Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgada, concluding their participation in the four-year event.
In the three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more pairs.
The ratio of three pairs of small points to each other was counted, which after the convincing loss in this match was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duo.
"In the first set we were in the lead, but from 16:15 we also stayed on 16 points", <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how the rest of the set went without points.
It should not be played.
Then in the second set everything was in order and at the end of the set managed to break the game, in addition it should have a good basis for the third set as well.
We started it similar, but after we switched sides, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many errors in the attack.
In the sub-group all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more like this, not repeatedly giving back 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be observed.
"In the first set we dealt with it, in the second we put 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already went to the game," <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> recalled.
We tried to show the best game.
Soon it came together, sometimes it didn't.
I did not look at the overall score before the match, but it was known that as many small points as possible were needed.
"If we lost, then I played badly," said Samoilov.
We expected a good servant from Evandra, and in the first set we did pretty well, but in the third set we opened a servant and it was difficult to form an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes at the reception directly at Peter’s service, but I had to deal with it.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match today, athletes were not nervous.
"We went, we played, we had protection, but we needed a better service," said the athlete.
"They played well and in the end got to the "urra"".
Before the tournament, we immediately said that the draw was the most uncomfortable it could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medal and we too from ourselves, but then there is no difference - 25th or fourth," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo will continue to play together in the future.
I think that there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilovam Riodejaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, because in 2008 in Beijing he started with M<0xC4><0x81>rti<0xC5><0x86>a P<0xC5><0x82>avin<0xC4><0x81>, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, this was the second start for <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>dins at the Olympics.
Latvenergo also follows the process of opening the gas market from the position of a potential trader.
State energy company Latvenergo is following the process of opening the gas market, both from the position of a consumer and a potential trader, said the company’s press secretary, Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader in the future will determine what kind of gas market model and legal framework will be created."
"We are therefore actively involved in drafting and commenting on the legislation, as well as submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Commission for Regulation of Public Services and the energy company "Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze" has developed a draft of the Cabinet of Ministers regulations "Regulations for the sale and use of natural gas" that will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, from April 3, 2017 on to the free use of natural gas.
When working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "central model of the trader" has been chosen, in which all the activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one place of information provision and customer service, leaving a technical issue in the hands of the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We remind that the gradual opening of the market for household users is envisaged - even after April 3, 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming connected to the users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, for a certain period of time, traders will ensure natural gas trade by the existing natural gas trader at a certain price.
The draft Cabinet regulations detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the procedures for the supply of natural gas to users and shall suspend the supply of natural gas, shall lay down the requirements for the safe use of the supply of natural gas, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gasified object owner for the supply and use of natural gas, the procedures for the supply of the supply of such natural gas shall be carried out, and the arrangements for the supply shall be made for the supply of the supply.

The state police (VP) on Friday detained a gunman and an armed man in Aspazija boulevard, VP representative Gita G<0xC5><0xBE>ibovska said.
The VP has been informed that there is an inadequate man walking along Aspazija boulevards who has armed himself with a gun and appears to be very stubborn.

Minister: It is planned to decide next week on an increase in the salary of the Director-General of VID.
The Minister of Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union (ZZS)) is planning to speak next week with Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about increasing the salary of the Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola pointed out to journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the salary of the Director-General of VID should be dealt with urgently, in order to make this position more attractive to potential candidates for the re-competition.
Also next week, we will be talking about changing the terms of the competition.
The Minister also stressed that she does not think of any specific candidate to be nominated for the vacant post.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the opinion that the Head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegov, would have been a good Director-General of VID.
With regard to the current head of the VID, Daci Pel<0xC4><0x97>ko, who expressed his readiness to apply for the post, the Minister reiterated his view that the new Director-General of the VID should have a "look from the side" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the Saeima to return from her leave in order to push as soon as possible amendments to the laws necessary for the reorganisation of the MED.
The Agency BNS has already announced that the Minister of Finance of the State Environment Service Inga Ko<0xC4><0xBC>egeva has submitted to Dana Reizniece-Ozola (ZZS), in which he withdraws his candidacy for the post of Director General of MED.
In her application, she stated that it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks her relatives have experienced serious emotional pressure, although they have not taken any legally condemnable actions.
Kolegova also pointed out that the consultation of her candidacy has increased the contradictions between the parties of the ruling coalition, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that former Director-General of the SDGs In<0xC4><0x81>ra P<0xC4><0x93>tersone left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to climb; stock indexes are rising in the US and Europe, as well as the value of the US dollar.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, positively influencing the mood of investors in Saudi Arabia's oil minister's remarks, which reinforces expectations that major oil-producing countries will take action at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
Three major U.S. stock indexes reached record highs on Thursday that had not been seen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in the European stock indexes.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the pound sterling and against the Japanese yen.
In the electronic trade of the New York Stock Exchange, the price of crude oil delivered by the WTI brand in September rose by 1.78 US dollars to 43.49 dollars per barrel.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries in October on the London Stock Exchange increased by $1.99 to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of canned producer "Blue Lagoon" last year decreased by 33,8%.
The turnover of the can manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" last year was 4,202 million euros, which is 33.8% less than a year earlier, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to 904,7 thousand euros, according to the annual financial report published in the database "Lursoft".
The company’s management report says that in 2015 the company was working with losses caused for several reasons, including due to the constant lack of circulating funds caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, the termination of the previously in force credit line and the termination of the “allowance” with the possibility of a default.
As a result, the company did not have enough funds to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and receive a volume discount.
The bank’s exit from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing projects supporting the European Union’s Structural Funds, which would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise its infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial creators were negatively affected by the increase in raw material prices and the unwillingness of customers to pay more than the company’s manufactured goods.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized the price changes and were ready to buy the goods at the new - the highest - prices," the company's management said.
Also in 2015, "Blue Lagoon" began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been to the company’s largest lender, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have become familiar with and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s operations and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan, which was launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"A number of plants have been purchased to ensure a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's plant to fulfill orders that were previously impossible.
The first batch of products to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the intention protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, everything produced will be sold according to the intention protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management said.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq.
"Blue Lagoon" in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, expanded the sales market to Cyprus and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, Blue Lagoon worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and a loss of EUR 5,113 million.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and has a fixed capital of 1.156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian private individuals - Mikhail Kaidanova (89.11%) and Igor <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1>on (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 to the museum to wait for the cinema duo Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Leanderi and participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the city of the beginning and inspiration of the beloved cinematic fairy Sarah Leander's career.
Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Lendere’s visit to the cross-mother Ruta, who was the wife of the Swedish Ambassador to Latvia, in Riga in 1924 turned out to be fateful, because it was she who discovered the unusual low contralto of Z<0xC4><0x81>ra Lendere’s wife, which she tried when debuting on the Riga cabaret theater stage.
Perhaps it was an accidental feeling in Riga that became a fateful turn on the creative path of Zara towards the world’s glory.
Riga Fair Leanderei was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to come to Riga in the guest performances, but unfortunately these hopes were not destined to be fulfilled, because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the show, this meeting will be possible at the Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Ker<0xC4><0x93>vica will take on the role of the outstanding Sarah Leander.
There are a lot of traffic restrictions in the area around Aglon.
In order to ensure the safety of the participants of the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Sky, from 12 August this year at 17.00 to 15 August at 18.00, the transit traffic of the cargo car will be closed on several state highways in the vicinity of Aglona, informed the State Roads of VAS Latvia.

The insurer pays compensation to the passengers of the cancelled flight at the airport on Wednesday.
If Insurance paid a travel insurance fee to a family for a flight cancelled at Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, which led to the refusal of the intended visit to the music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a customer.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to cancelled flights at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was charged a fee for the reservation of accommodations, which could not be canceled anymore, as well as for the 20 tickets purchased at the festival.4
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on airline tickets.
If Insurance out of all travel insurance reimbursements, an average of 15% of cases have paid compensation for travel interruptions or cancellations.
"At such times, expenses are reimbursed for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation," says Dagnija Rutka, Head of Insurance Product Risk Insurance for Insurance Individuals.
As is known, on the evening of August 10, due to technical problems on the runway of the airport "Riga", a private plane stopped, so only several flights were canceled, but several incoming flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Because of the repair of the neighbor, the man is at the collapsed ceiling and forced to leave the house.
In the LTV program "Study 4" turned Dmitry Saidyashev, whose neighbor started capital repair in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been dripping plaster from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment has a damaged ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Authority, the managers of the houses and other organizations.
The construction manager said that we are not an operational service and we do not have any experts.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and from there there there will be an expert," says Dmitry.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and acknowledged that the cover was in an unsatisfactory condition.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitriy’s submission to the construction board, and until the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether being in the apartment is not life-threatening.
The construction manager said - such is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they transferred the house manager, then the house manager back to the building authority, and then there is a dead end," says Dmitry.
After examining the whole pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, although you can hear from time to time that someone is working there.
Within another two months, an expert examination must be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment who carries out the repair works, all these defects must be eliminated.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal lattice in this load-bearing structure is affected, therefore there is no assurance that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"We have therefore asked for further explanation from this expert," says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the prohibition to carry out any repair work in the upper apartment, from there you can still hear that the construction continues.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in this case the penalty can be much more expensive.
While the expert opinion is expected, the construction board has decided that both apartments should not be operated - both the one in which the construction work is taking place and the Dmitry apartment.
"This is not the case in the construction board's practice, when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply unwillingness, the residents may have created a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit their property," says the representative of the construction board.
Now Dmitry is left to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, a hotel or to rent another apartment.
But the losses incurred Dmitry can try to recover from the neighbor on a civil basis, which can take a lot of time.
Due to arbitrary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to wait up to three weeks.
The damage caused will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which the repair work took place.
The owner of this apartment, due to the fact that the construction board has not taken into account, is also threatened with imprisonment for a period of up to six months.

The conversion of the former Kemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Kemer sanatorium into a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Kemeri" will cost 22 million euros, the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Kemeri" Gita <0xC5><0xBD>elve tells the agency LETA.
The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former Kemer sanatorium.
The second stage will be the wellness clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the hotel is scheduled to open in May 2018.
<0xC5><0xBD>elve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the former polyclinic building of the <0xC4><0xB6>emeri resort, which has an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
"Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and the owner of the intended clinic is the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest in this fund, says <0xC5><0xBD>elve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, it is planned to invest between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million in the creation of the former resort polyclinic, with a total investment of over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
It has already been reported that in the restoration of the cultural-historical park over an area of 42 hectares, the construction of the millstones up to the restoration of the tri-junior roads and streets, the construction of an interactive natural tourism object, the improvement of the territory and the construction of parking lots on Em<0xC4><0xAB>la D<0xC4><0x81>rzi<0xC5><0x86>a Street, which will contribute to the development of the J<0xC5><0xAB>rmala city’s social economy.
Design works are planned until mid-2017, but construction and repair work will start in the autumn of next year.
As reported, in the historic sanatorium complex "<0xC4><0xB6>emeri" it is planned to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri" and a "wellness" or wellness clinic.
However, the reconstruction took a long time.
In turn, in the 2010 report it was also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicating with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control in the sanatorium "Kemeri" and already in 2011 definitely being "completed reconstruction of the upcoming hotel "Kemeri" and immediately starting work.
In October 2014, Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri confirmed its readiness to buy the insolvent <0xC4><0xB6>emeri sanatorium belonging to Ominasis Latvia at the auction, but a month later the auction was declared a non-event, because the winner had not paid for the auction at the specified time.
The selling price was determined according to the starting price of the last non-occurring auction - 2.86 million euros.
As the agency LETA informed the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of the co-financing of the European Union structural funds will arrange the infrastructure - will restore the historical Kemeru park, will create an interactive natural tourism object, will arrange roads.
The President will present to the opera singer Antonenko the Order of the Three Stars.
The President of Latvia, Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis, will next week, on 16 August, give a lecture to Alexander Antonenko, a Class III surgeon of the Order of the Three Stars, according to the President’s agenda.
The ceremony of the Three Star Order will take place at the Black Lion House at 13:00.
As evidenced by the information provided by the Latvian National Opera and Ballet (LNOB), Antonenko graduated from J<0xC4><0x81>zepas Medi<0xC5><0x86>a Music College in 1998, where he learned to play percussion and learned to sing at Margaritas Gruzdeva.
He studied at the Vocal Department of J<0xC4><0x81>zeps V<0xC4><0xAB>tols Latvian Academy of Music in Arv<0xC4><0xAB>da Luste class.
In 1997 he started singing in the Latvian National Opera choir, but in 1998 he made his debut with the Oberto role in G.F.Hendelis' opera "Al<0xC4><0x8D>ina".
Received the "Great Music Award 2003" for vocal performance in opera performances and Verdi in Requiem.
It is noted that in the 2004/2005 season it became the most internationally recognized tenor of Latvia, which is engaged by the largest opera houses in the world.
Since the autumn of 2004, he has sung at the "Dieseldorf Deutsche Oper am Rhein", the Berlin and Graz Opera, the Dresden "Semperoper", the Oslo and Stockholm Royal Operas, the London Covent Garden Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, the Vienna State Opera, and the Vienna State Opera.
In 2009, Antonenko debuted with great success in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince "Narah".
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title "Otello" with Ricardo Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Paris Opera, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang Luigi "Ampmetnia" in his new studio, and in Stockholm he participated in Christoph Loyt's "Rittenmeier".
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Otello in London's Covent Garden Opera with great success.
The former NATO commander Bridlov’s email was hacked by Russian hackers.
Hackers who hacked into the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out several other cyberattacks, as well as hacked the servers of former NATO European Force Commander Filip Bridlov and the George Soros Institute's "Open Society" on Thursday morning.
The hackers published the information on the site "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Bridlov’s letter and information about the work of the Soros Institute are also placed there.
For hackers, the institute's computers were available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyberattacks were carried out by the same Russian intelligence-related hackers who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to formally accuse the servers of the Democratic Party of hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities in a cyber attack.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website in July published about 20,000 e-mails obtained from the DNC's computer system, all of which suggest that Democratic Party leaders were trying to harm party candidate Hillary Clinton's candidacy for president of Vermont's Senate.
According to U.S. media sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts investigations into the hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other U.S. intelligence agencies, believe that Russia's connection to the cyber attack is undeniable.
MacArthur: Joko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Makartniys acknowledged that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger for the legendary band "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star is currently in a "good" relationship with the widow of the late John Lennon, but when she went to the group to visit the recording studio, McCartney was terrified because Ono was the only woman in the group - George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon.
When the singer was asked about both relationships, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the groups could not stand it.
We were able to do it, but not quite successful, because we were very tight.
We were not sexist, but the girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they allowed us to operate.
When John started dating Joko, she wasn't in the control room, she was in the middle of the four of us.
The author of the recording "Yellow Submarine" also admitted that he now regularly communicates with a former member of the group Ringo, and every now and then approves the work plans of the recording studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" have "come to work".
When asked if he was still dating the only other member of the legendary rock band still alive, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often not."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don't go to meetings, I feel a little off the mark.
I left Apple at the time of the divorce.
In my place, I sent John Realtman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't afford to sit at that table."
It was too painful, as if to see the death of your pet.
The company is now working in such a way that I only listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms that are also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, had once been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have already mentioned in advance that the slow speed of Venus can be explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and it turned slowly.
The model also looks at the former topography of Venus.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to be able to form life and not allow water to evaporate.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venusian rotation model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explained GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the surface of the planet and causes a thing that in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as a rain guard, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
As a result, a moderate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation over the course of billions of years.
Its oceans were scorched, and the longitudes were burned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water is completely evaporated, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas, Venus, as we know it today, remains.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Colorado "Avalanche" coach and vice president of hockey operations Patrick Roys submitted a waiver, as a reason to mention, insufficient influence in the team decision-making process.
The vice president and general manager of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have energetically, passionately and purposefully fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of operations for the Colorado Club of Hockey," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team to give it the shine it needs and achieve higher-level results.
To achieve this, the visions of the vice president of the head coach and hockey operations must be fully aligned with the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakiks, who joined Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakiks said that Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the knockout games, the Colorado team was taken over by the Minnesota hockey team. Since then, the club has not entered the knockout games for two years.
Avalanche finished the 2015-2016 season with 39-39-4 and remained five points behind the Wild team without receiving a second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
The goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with Montreal's "Canadiens" and two with the "Avalanche".
Workers of the North Sea oil platform resume negotiations and postpone strike
Workers’ strikes on the remuneration of workers on the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed because negotiations between the two parties to the dispute have resumed, the leaders of the negotiations say.
Periodically, strikes against the oil processing company <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Wood Group" are held on the North Sea oil platforms, in which the company <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The Joint Communication states that the trade unions of Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
Several full-day meetings are planned in the coming weeks, which will begin early next week with the aim of re-examining the problematic issues.
Trade unions said their recent measures, organised after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at a planned 30 per cent wage reduction.
This year, due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced wages for workers in the North Sea by 9 percent.
In 2014, the company already reduced the wages of land-based workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to cut oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with the British energy company, the BG Group.
Energy companies feel pressured by falling oil prices, and the situation is further complicated by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individuals.
In 2016, almost $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new North Sea projects, compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of stars in the Pleiades star.
The latest Kepler mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this star rotate at different speeds, as well as how the speed of rotation of stars can be attributed to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, their age and even the history of their solar system," said Luisa Rebula, a researcher at the Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center.
The Pleiadian star is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at the maximum speed.
When shooting at maximum speed, these growing stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When the winds reach the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As stars age, their rate of rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable area of stars, such as the sunspot.
The latest catalog of the speed of rotation of stars shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebul compares the stars to the dancers, the dancers of greater height perform pirouettes slower than the dancers of small height.
Rebul says that in the Pleiades "ballet" you can see that the slowly rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of stars with the speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of rotation of the stars will slow down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the rotation speed of Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
