There are a number of MPs who are concerned about a proposal that their title should be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created due to plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
As a result, the police officers in the area are being harassed by the police.
A member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would rhyme on Twp and PwP.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means dom and pwp kaka.
A member of the plaid party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group had been open about the name change, but stated that MWP and Muppet would not be far behind.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: "The appropriate decision on the appointment of the deputies is, of course, up to the deputies themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the commission released the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received a lot of support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the title of MPs.
The MPs seem to suggest other options, but the fight to reach a consensus can cause Cape Town to appeal to the leading official, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft legislation on the changes within two weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes other changes, such as how the Assembly functions, including rules on the disqualification of deputies and the design of the committee system.
Members of Parliament will be given the last word on the question, as they are supposed to be called, when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote for a referendum to change the country's name.
The country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia" on Sunday.
The popular vote was set up in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, which is Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents an outcry on their territory and has repeatedly voted against their bid for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the name change, said he did not want to recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the name change was the price to pay for the EU's membership in NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are as quiet as the churches during the Battle of Harlem.
"In the past, the elders said that there was a café and a church on every corner," said Lord Adams.
"There's nothing else today."
He said the disappearance of coffee was understandable.
“People are socializing differently,” he said.
"Cafes aren't just places where people go on a regular basis."
As for the girls, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as those responsible imagine, "and sooner or later they will be back where they started."
Church, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with property housing and filled with people who do not help the sheltered residents in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to close these churches quickly, because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was moved to the 1930s.
A black community from not far away has taken over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major avenue for trade in Harlem that no blacks wanted to hire.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the clique.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's buffoon and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the clique "The clique of the poor."
The expert, who played the clique in July, called it otherwise: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first blackjack game to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger blackjack game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place in St. Martin in the last month was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were introduced by the laypersons, others by the bishop's diocese.
The sacristy – the Por its governing body, with lay representatives – in July wrote down the diocese, with the concern that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs to the sacristy”, although the sacristy was not in the position of architects and entrepreneurs.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency of the pages of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark was injured while diving in California.
A shark attacked and blessed a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was sunk after lobster in California, the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was a Saturday the month since half an hour with friends at the dive, when he heard the boy call for help and you were paddled by a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had thought at the beginning that it would be just the joy of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was "bored!" shouted.
I'm going to bite them!"
"It was all over the place," he said as he reached his son's grave.
"I told everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-dangerous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim is suffering from traumatic injuries at the workplace.
Officials closed the access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for interrogation and for security purposes.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark charts in the area, most of which, however, are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s climbs to the UK’s beauty pageant.
Sainsbury's takes boats, superdrugs, and Debenhams, with Kafhaus-style beauty departments with specialized assistants.
As part of a substantial promotion to the British beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow steadily while fashion and household goods are returned, these larger beauty departments will have 11 stores across the country, and in the next year and beyond they will continue to do business.
The supermarkets invest in beauty, because they want to fill the shelves, which were otherwise reserved for the dishes, the microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said they would be the size of its beauty offering up to 3,000 products including, for the first time, branded Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The assortments of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, which are already available, will also gain more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boat stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
Perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and buying small amounts of everyday foods and small businesses means that the supermarkets have to make more effort to get people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the managing director of Sainsbury's, said the outlets were increasingly looking like department stores, as the supermarket chain tried to fight more services and non-food products against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' has opened Argos outlets and hundreds of aftermarkets and also some habitat businesses since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago. This has strengthened the sales of the groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to change the name of the company's cosmetics and cosmetics department was unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but the cooperation was after a dispute over the share of revenues from drugstores and supermarkets quickly escalated.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 drugstores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Llodys should play a role in the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, into four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old ways of shopping in the spotlight."
Peter Jones "swallows" over a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become "slow" after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a contract worth over <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
This Morning's 37-year-old presenter announced on her Instagram account that she is going.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, out of her lucrative Lifetsyle brand business last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "swimming" as the TV star during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she had no access to any more money.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated net worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones moved from the UK and went to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It would have been their long-term future that would have been accompanied by the next century.
His decision to leave was a surprise to all the people involved.
No one could believe what had happened at the beginning of the story.
In Marlow's headquarters, there is a warehouse with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of This-Morining-Moderator, which is one of the bankable stars from the UK, could cost the company millions, because they invested a lot in products, from bags and baskets to clothes and homewear, and it will now potentially be delayed again for launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been dating Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years now.
Willoughby brought Truely to the stage with the 2016 Capp, and Jones, 52, came on as president in March.
The couple went on a vacation together and Jones was 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings."
We're in love, and then we fall in love.
He made the joke about the criticism he would receive from the media over a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "TV Moderator Voice" play.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump's first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on the denuclearization are not forthcoming.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North saw no "corresponding response" from the U.S. to North Korea's previous disarmament steps.
The U.S. will continue to push for sanctions to continue.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm good with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results – no more missile tests, the help to free hostages and the repatriation of American soldiers who had fallen in the fight from deadly remnant missiles, stopped the US tests and gave them free rein.
And he has defended his unusual way and manner of speaking about relations with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to fight in this crowded arena, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to people directly in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national catastrophe has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalyzing of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it is a challenge,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children assembled a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to work on foreign personnel on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Administration, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief effort.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, unfortunately, the country does not remain sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Although Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not found anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though it was a warning, may have cost many lives.
The travel between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims makes its way to Palu, but takes at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the streets and the railways.
But Lord Yoko's reign was also marred by a lack of funding, where he resigned the next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from party tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, bows and arrows and other brutal weapons on the streets.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool compares the match to a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool by a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London against a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot it in the direction of the goal.
The attempt is flown high over the box, in the direction of the right corner of the net.
The ball was flown over a jumping Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just about getting into this position, getting the ball and playing games like the Shaq always being as close as possible, so I tried to make sure we had as much time as possible," Sturridge said on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge coming and I touched it once, and I didn't think about it and just shot it."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break before a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game in this game before sprinting towards Liverpool half.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then threw a beautiful ball, which sent the hazard and the box.
The hazard runs along the defense and ends at the long post with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 A.M. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
Indonesia's death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, as the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the spokesman of the agency, Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were saved in the rubble of buildings, which destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 a square mile, and released a wave of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was overcrowded with piles of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murder was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this month.
The 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
People in the area who have seen or heard something should report to the police.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also encourage any other person, especially taxi drivers who have recorded anything on Dashcam footage, to contact us, as they may have information that may be important to our surveys.’
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, who was found dead, lived in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
This afternoon, they are friends who think they know the woman, who came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found.
Police are continuing to investigate the case and have informed other members of the family of the victim.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, now just wanted to go back to his apartment, but police explained to him that at the moment no one is entering or leaving the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
It's been said that it can take a long time for people to get back home.
It was reported that a police officer told a man that at the moment the entire area is considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She always repeats, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were parked in front of the building.
A number of police officers entered the building and searched the building.
Anyone who has any information should get in touch with @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of September 30th.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament will be the new memorial to the series "Rewriting History."
His exile would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the fanatical and puritanical supporters of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "innocent" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The symbolism of the English Civil War was ned ordered by Cromwell and also not executed.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroftseng's grand representation of Cromwell is the proof of the 19th-century opinion and is part of the historical writing of a figure, of which still many people believe that it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it's a very accurate representation is still an issue.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of this division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are to be celebrated and remembered.
Pigs are being slaughtered by farmers.
Local media reported that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery near a stall on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, for an injection of vaccines for pigs in a courtyard.
According to reports, he was hired on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next month, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby shed.
He said there was a large male pig in the barn with blood on it.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the date 550 pounds of heavy pork crushed the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and forbidden," said the cousin with the family name "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The pictures of surveillance cameras show the Yuan Doneshdes going to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pig.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of the yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig had been spat out to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence on the spot.
According to reports, the yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating decisions for his death.
However, there have been cases in which pigs have been attacked by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their port in Massachusetts. The man was seriously wounded.
In 2006, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife could drive away the animals.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "excretionists."
They're just playthings.
They just don't want you, they just don't want you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Rainfall in the southwest of the United States due to Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the dead waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Rosa floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States will be brought with them in the next few days.
The rose has been spotted at 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, in Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will be a sundial in the north.
Meanwhile, a channel is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading towards the west coast of the United States, and the Rosa may be closer and closer to the peninsula of Baja California than a tropical storm, it will begin to penetrate deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest of the U.S.
D’Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, which interacts with the nearest channel, will form far distributed heavy locks in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain causes dangerous flooding, mud and possible landslides in the desert.
Thief tropical humidity causes locks of 2 to 3 inches per hour at various locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible, with re-conditions that are becoming increasingly worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-hearted to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical closures.
Covering reeds can cause canyons that quickly become flooded and thunderstorms will bring local rough air and dust with them.
The nearest canal will bring deke local shipping to the parts of the southern California coast.
Locks of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mudflows and slippery roads.
This would be the first reindeer in the region of the reindeer season.
Some distributed tropical travel routes begin to get closer to Arizona, in the late summer and early spring, before the river continues to distribute, in the late summer and summer.
The sledgehammer will be placed in the four corners of the field.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain rather warm.
Heiansdo leads this to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sun in the center of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, a warm start is expected in October with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast will provide high chances for average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
Over 20 million people watched the gripping statement at the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, whom he accused of sexual rape, which was supposed to have happened in the 1980s, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political swindle continues, and the broadcasters have interrupted the regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a frenzy: an agreement signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had fully tested her and tried to fire her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people are expected to attend the trial.
The company has an average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that have transferred the process, including PBS, C-Span, and Fox Business Network were not directly available.
In Nielsen, there are often some difficulties, including people who look in the office.
To illustrate: The number of spectators corresponds to that of a playoff football match or the Oscars overtake.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators have supported Kavanaugh's appointment, has guided all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the process over the course of the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Freideg.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for the Kavanaugh, he was given a free-of-charge motion by protesters while trying to get a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes open while he was being chased and was live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power, but so many women don't have power."
Flake announced that his office would have given a statement and, before the elevator went up, he would have had more to say after the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio networks all reported late in the morning that the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI is going to be investigating the allegations against the nominees for next week, which the Democratic minority wanted.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without the mediation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "playing politics" with regard to Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of abandoning their plans to "play politics" with the British future and weaken national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson outlined his attack on her so-called checkers' plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should raise their taxes on each other would be "more likely."
Wayde-Sims shooting: The police have arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson due to the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and brought to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said the Sims lost their eyebrows in the fight.
Police found the eyebrow on the spot and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After hearing the Simpsons, the police said that he had agreed to have Wayde shot.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner has released a provisional report Friday, where it says the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the Louisiana State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and residents of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "walking in the pursuit of justice."
The Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 meter tall grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday, Moien told the LSU basketball coach that his team was "destroyed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what people are always worried about," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Late ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Relief warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and recorded 183 gas and ash eruptions in the last 24 hours.
The center has a number of bells and whistles.
Images on social networks show thin layers of ashes on the cars and neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed a tsunami of volcanic activity that shook 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and as thousands took part in rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing election for separation.
A group of masked pro-Separtists were held back during riots against the police with bricks and powder paint, which formed dark clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Batsmen also broke out later in the day and the police took out their batons to control the fighters.
Over the course of a few hours, pro-independence groups called for "no forgetting, no forgiveness" against the Unionists who called for "long-lived Spain."
Fourteen people have been medically treated for injuries at the protestors, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters elected a majority to become independent, yet the result was small against the separation through the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities after they were blessed with nearly 1,000 people last year after the police tried to stop the election and the election offices through the region of violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Fridays over night to prevent a demonstration over the support of the national police.
The show went on, but there was another way to go.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has any hope as to the prospects of an independent Catalonia.
“Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy, because they could choose to go, but now I'm stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, it was difficult for the Catalan independence parties in this year to remain in sway. Most of the most well-known leaders were in exile or in exile and hung on to their role in the organization of the referendum and later on.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who picked up the protesters on the phone as support for the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two sides.
"It's getting more and more complicated," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, has announced in Samsden that he will take part in the European elections next year.
"As a candidate to stand for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car runs into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent in Denmark at 19:30 BST.
Insp Bob Blemmings said there will be damage to the pair and to the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point a gun was fired at the car.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers through the Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Promoted Livingston outranked the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second win in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, which are eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, the Rangers had picked up Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still enjoying the victory since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on chances against open visitors.
The Holt's team should have had the news long before the hit, because their directness caused the Ranger problems.
Scott Robinson was forced through but carried his effort to the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only target his effort in front of the Craig Halket in front of the goal.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery to the visitors.
And that's how the decision was made.
The Rangers were given a free kick in Livingston, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the menga, who once touched and met from the center of the box.
At that time, the Rangers dominated the possession but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot wide of another Livingston pitcher.
Crusaders always came to Livingston's chest and were always cleared of debris, while two eleftherometers were ordered - after the necklace challenged the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – were tamed.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this high road.
Their style of play and staffing had hardly changed since their return to the top curse, but big credit had to go to the wood for the way he had refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, led by a super organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall through to their tenths.
The Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass felt – only as they met the home side – and it is something of a wake-up call for the Rangers who found themselves in the midfield.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a reception in Cologne.
There were laughs in blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany watched them drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an set out on his way to Cologne to build a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have flocked to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – have also heard their voices, both condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
Both protestors reflect the divisions of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by various German Turks and as a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescue assistants helped, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place months after a cyclist died during a driver's flight on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Police said the officers were on their way to identify the man and inform the family.
Traffic jams and bus diversions are on the scene and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Blessed in Onset of Imprisonment
Six hostages have been blessed with an emergency in a high-security prison for men, the prison official said.
Ordering has broken out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on a Sunday and it is continuing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were called in to take care of the order, which involved eight prisoners in a flotilla.
Officers were stationed on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison said: "Specially trained prison staff were hired to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that the police are responsible and could spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison in the clinic was treated after one was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, offensive officers were called to the prison to take care of a difficult situation in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (drought surfaces can benefit)
It's rare to encounter a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's probably what happens early next week as Hurricane Rosa sings last energy down through the southwest desert teeming with flood risks.
The national recovery has already seen flooding for months in Densden, Arizona heading south and east of Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route across Phoenix to Denshden and come closer at least later with rain.
The National Resurgence in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only “ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 centimetres of rain, with isolated inches up to 6 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are possible to get 1 to 2 centimetres, with isolated inches up to 4 centimetres.
For those without flood risks, Rosa's rain is a blessing as the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, a bit of rain will probably be good because in the southwest are currently dry conditions.
Just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category," said Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way to the country across the Baja California Peninsula from Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power a Sunday morning with a maximum wall speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is raging on more killing waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
So, there is expected to be land swarming in Mexico with tropical storm strengthening in the afternoon or evening.
The risk of flooding in parts of Mexico could be high, with a significant risk of flooding.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 centimetres is expected from Baja California and northwest Sonora, with up to 10 centimetres possible.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border and early morning hours Tuesday as a tropical depression, where it will then move up through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main threat expected from Rosa or his remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States' southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudflows in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton has been charged with four counts of murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for premeditated murder after a 16-year-old man was found dead in Somerset.
The teenagers were found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terraces in Midsomer Norton, near 4 a.m.
When he was brought to the hospital, his health condition was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and his 20 year-old husband were arrested in the night in the area of Radstock, Avon police said.
The police were called in to report the incident to witnesses who may have picked up the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the communal anger of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and impetuous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Kavanaugh had suffered through the very recklessness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh strongly and emotionally refuted Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually harassed them when they were teenagers before Congress.
Ford has also said it's going to come out.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have seen the glory and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed death toll for the public.
The president noted on the Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican voter turnout in the middle of the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm running," he said.
"That's why I went everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump has argued that he is on a mission to "stop and slow down."
The first decisive election at the Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place in a peaceful manner, a senior matron worker told CNN.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many have been washed away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu in peace as 6 meters high waves and the semi-darkness struck across the coast, which killed many and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami as a result of an earthquake mated to a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami became threatening yesterday, people were still walking on the beach following their activities and did not immediately leave," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster protection agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, cabins, heat, it hit everything on land with it," said Nugroho, still clarifying that the tsunami on the sea speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Several people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to Palu in 24 cents.
Aerial footage made public by the disaster protection shows many buildings and buttocks destroyed, bridges that have collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque that is completely surrounded by water as well.
The Samsdens were in the coastal town.
The earthquake has been recorded in a region of 2.4 million people.
The agency for the evaluation and use of the technology said in a statement that the energy released during the earthquake on Friday had the force of 200 times the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical situation at the end of a long-drawn-out bay may have further exacerbated the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extreme" and said that thousands of elevators, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies have been found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho says that the injuries and the damage to me could be great on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in a neighborhood called di Doggola and date me to the epicenter.
The communication "has completely collapsed and we are without information" from Donggola, according to the Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can be worse," he said.
The agency, as well as its Samsden firm, were criticized for not only saying that the tsunami hit Palu, officials said the waves came at the same time as the warning went out.
Amateur images on social media point to a man on a higher stack who warns you by calling you on the street below before the tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and buildings and cars are mated.
Reuters was only able to confirm the pictures' voice.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused massive power outages, and communications around Palu have lagged behind, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army first sent transport planes with aid guides from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and supplies for the most important needs.
The local airport was only opened for the rescue teams and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's all bad.
While the staff of World Vision of Donggola arrived safely in Palu City as where the employees and tents were submerged on the grounds of this office, they had to face scenes of destruction within their families, according to Lord Doseba.
"They taught me that a lot of houses were destroyed," he said.
It's all bad.
Esougu<0xC3><0xAB>r as the relief teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction voiced, several have complained that foreign relief teams, with great experience, were only allowed to land on Palu.
According to Indonesian law, material and personnel only enter the country when the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
It's just as if it's happening.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, it's like a national disaster,' we can open up to international aid but it's not happening yet."
When the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of peace, friends and families hope that here missing among those wonders you always appear after such disasters.

A Sunday their rescuer freed a woman who was buried under a pile of rubble, directly next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has two of the most missing paragliders who have been spared training for the Asian players,
Other students from the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, according to Lord Mandagi.
"As a paramedic, I had my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours after the announcement where the smell of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the Paragliding Group was going around, WhatsApp had sent messages to the teams that participated in the Beach Festival.
Unfortunately, the two of them had only a single shot, and the other two had a single shot.
"I think it's just the news that's being delivered," he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport / Levee.
The robbers had stolen 26,750 dollars in Newport/Levee on Friday from a Brink's security guard who was on his way to fill up a bank account, meaning it was in a letter from Newport police.
The chauffeur had started emptying the bank account in a resort complex and was supposed to just pay the money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was busy, his other man "came from behind the Brink's employee" and stole his money case which should have been delivered immediately.
Witnesses said more suspects had fled the scene, but the police had only been told how many were there.
Anyone with information about the identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In a tweet, he wrote: "The one officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, as zanter for a time called Ye gin and has used the peak number as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change will come together with a new appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the start of a new album is expected.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande di for "emotional reasons" only in the show, according to the show's founder.
Although there is an abbreviation to a short professional name like, the West has already said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' as the date most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," the West told me earlier this year, at a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"I am you, I am the sea, I am the sea.
It comes from Kanye, dat means the only one, to only Ye - in mirror of our good, our evil, our persuasion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who I am."
He is one of many famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has decided on Love and Brother Love.
A former West's matt singer, Jay-Z, has always played matt minor and major.
The U.S. military in Mexico is fighting against civilians.
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to raise the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to Samsden "never use the military voice to suppress the Mexican people's voice."
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, the troops shot at the people and killed 300 at a time in which they went on a left-leaning ruck through Latin America as well.
Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans will be supported through monthly grants to students and through the opening of more free universities.
He said that the lack of transparency and transparency in the criminal justice system should be encouraged.
The U.S. government has threatened to cut funding for the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount in research in the field of artificial intelligence, says AI investor and friend Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come as more and more from circles of the U.S. government than the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in researching AI.
Meanwhile, China has unveiled its plan for the last year: the first in the research of AI voice by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, when one considers that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next jump being measured in the U.S., Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month came out at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most famous companies for AI in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later serving as General Director at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee knew of previous technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wondered when you would be next, to help you find the next visionary voice.
U.S. officials often have to work hard to get state aid, Lee said.
"It's not just China that keeps the academic top people; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have engaged the lights and the last few years of universities to work on AI voice.
Lee said that the immigration law could also boost AI research in the United States.
"I think the Green Card is automatically required to be offered to professors at the AI," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government unveiled its next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) development plan.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are doing for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work as in China is only as good, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the U.S., the Department of Defense established joint AI centers to bring together industry partners and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA has announced a $2 trillion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which currently invests over $100 million in the AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government has been tasked with setting up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonia decides to change the name of the country by referendum
The majority of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to ease its usual dispute with Greece that would prevent membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claimed that the name of Noopeschland in an attempt to insinuate itself into the province and vetoed its veto against its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal in June under the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign showed that it would be difficult for you to achieve an experiential 50 percent vote for the elections to be valid.
The text of the referendum reads: "You are in favour of a NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name Wessel, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price would be paid for a takeover in organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people live freely under the pretense of the European Union because it means more to secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although only legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they would seek to obtain the result of the vote.
A second majority is required for the change of name in Parliament.
The state election commission said there would be no inconsistencies in the elections until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections where 66 percent of eligible voters voted.
"I have come far from my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a widower in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko announced in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to level the road to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, set a small stage in silence in front of the tents of those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to head high, only through the chickens," Kavadarkov said.
"We are in a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they only want us as Macedonia, we can turn to each other as China and Russia become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring our important investments to Macedonia, waat on Chomagetaux has more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the population is therefore more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU as well," Zaev said after leaving the cabinet.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirmation for our future."
A recent poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than expected.
Another poll, by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of the respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they're willing to pay.
In order for the referendum to be valid, one must vote 50 percent plus one.
This would be the first time that the Democratic Party's anti-government campaign has been banned by the federal government.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks through the entire defense of Brighton and makes a goal

He ran as a test three defenders of Brighton and then hated his open field.
As a result, Aguero scored four goals.

The joke about the game against the Rockies
With the elimination of the Nationals in the playoff, as a reason there to force a new start.
But the ever-expanding Scherzer hopes to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs are the one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals one Friday night, but still struggled to secure their title in the first division.
"And if we don't play for anything, at least we can make a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other teams that are likely to play at the highest level that I'm going to experience this year.
Why shouldn't I put up with that?"
The Nationals still have to communicate how to start a Sunday, but are certainly well advised to let the jokers pitch in that situation.
The scherzer, who will play his 34th start, threw a bullpen session in a donut and will play a Sunday on his break day.

Trump's visit to West Virginia
The president has pointed to the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Upper House while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these midterm elections.
"Everything I've been waiting for is coming up in November.
Five weeks ahead of the most important elections in our lives.
This as one of the big, big — I'm only running but I'm actually running for it I'm fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing these horrifying, horrifyingly radical groups of Democrats, you're seeing what's happening now.
And those who are determined to take power under all circumstances, you see the sinlessness, the community.
Those who, no matter who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control, date as it pleases them, power and control, we will not give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you see dat in the last four days," he said, referring to Democrats as "rose and senseless and clumsy and losing."
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee's matt Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein with the name that was most frequently exploited.
"Do you remember the answer here?"
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, waat.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Work is no longer God's work.
It's like being intolerant to those who think.
When I was asked to vote for a candidate in my constituency, I was a little surprised.
In the end, I'm the last one from a labor party that I'd been fired from - just because I think so.
My party colleague Joan Ryan is treated as similar because she is resolutely against anti-Semitism as well.
In my case, when the censorship criticized me because I wasn't right to Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt looks at the importance of a responsible approach in the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar to positions in which Jeremy has been ranked among previous leaders.
The note for Nottingham East Workers' Meeting for Peace says that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a local labor representative, the Friday evening meetings were exactly the date.
Today, unfortunately, as dat only more the sound of many meetings and the promises of "my friendly, my fine" policy than zanter long time forgotten when, anyway, it was ever so.
It is more and more striking that other opinions are tolerated only in the workers' party and any opinion will be judged as acceptable as for the party leadership.
This was shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought we would have had similar political views at once that I would have taken the time and taken a position that I would never otherwise have taken - in national security as well as in the EU.
Every time I've publicly sworn - and it's not really a big deal I say - I'll then get a tirade of remarks on social media against the politics of the media, and that we'll say I had only my place in the Workers' Party.
It's not just my experience.
However, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and who do not look away after all.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is how the level of abuse is becoming more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with all the "net-trust" movement or change of selection rules the party is getting smaller and smaller.
I've gotten a lot of advice in the last two years, to keep me calm, not to be too hard, and then I'd be "in line."
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I was admitted to the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by a local government failure during which my classroom almost coincided, I have tried to improve the public services for those who need it most – whether as a government minister or as a government minister.
I've never tried to hide my politics, not even in the last whales.
No one in Nottingham East has been able to doubt my political position and the points at which I do not agree with the current leadership.
For those who favor the movement of a peaceful, all I want to say is when the country faces a Brexit that protects the state, trade and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my faith in the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is about the Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will deter me from doing so, for which I believe it's all in your favor.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr unbeaten at the top
Two attempts in the last period have boosted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now in the final, the only unbeaten of 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, just like the better capture of chances, about which the home team and coach Peter Murchie could rejoice.
"We've been in charge of our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "Good for Ayr, they took the chance better than me."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, accompanied by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr close, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which he received in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unconverted attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before half time, he then converted a solo attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, converted by Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was felt, in a fresh start, Ayr was able to restart through a lap from Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to use the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, as always, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card, as he touched the climo without a ball on the Strooflinn, the Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of the attacking Ayr.
Climo was able to turn around as he did from the start, after Kyle Rowe was able to catch David Armstrong's kickoff and flanker Gregor Henry managed to make a late fifth run.

The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling under roof in the main quarter of La Paz.
Public buildings have raised an ocean-blue flag.
The motto of the Titicaca to the Amazon is: "The sea belongs to us with justice.
It's our duty to take it back."
Across the entire country of Bolivia, the memory of a conflict in the 19th century in Chile's lost coast is still alive - there is the will to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Right now, the hope is greater than ever, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and trust and, of course, hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens in the hope that the Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia and – after decades of sporadic talks – Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia on a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year – is betting a lot on the talks of a few days ago.
"We've been in the Pacific for a while," he said in August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court may not decide in favor of Bolivia – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN agency, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has not had any violence against Chile and has announced that it will not engage in any talks.
The court's decision six months after the final hearing shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of the Bolivian oil, the last four years have brought it to a halt.
"The question of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration," the statement said.
Morales's combative rhetoric weakened all Chilean will, with precision.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk at some point, but it is then extremely difficult to carry out the talks after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not expelled any ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, as Bolivian representative in The Hague, reiterated that the court's decision was particularly quickly liked.
The move offers Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "compete a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also reiterated that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – uses the maritime exit as a political leap forward.
"Bolivia never ceases to assert its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The court is an opportunity to try to leave our past behind us," he said.
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Before It Can Trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke at a rally in front of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to honour its promises made to the presidents of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was trying to break off nuclear diplomacy negotiations more than three months after Singapore renegotiated with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions in the US's approach against a declaration for the Korean War would force Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration, without Pyongyang taking the first step in the direction of massive disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about disarming an arsenal that sees the country as the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show shows a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne reveal at Catwalk a wealth of oversized headwear for their SS19 collection that sets the style on the Paris Fashion Weeks and the Shelf.
Absolutely impractical heat, Instagram flooded this summer and these designers sent their striking creations to the Catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather in the model's head flooded.
Other oversized accessories with beautiful watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released a few comedic masks – just right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have knotted lips and are more similar to the Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkeling and snorkeling, while the other looks like a molten glass cornet.
And if you want to see more – then do not be disappointed.
A lot of people will tell you that they'll be able to find their way to you on the road.
The oversized heat equalled the festivities of "La Bomba", the bat with a 60 cm wide board, which one had already seen by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the strong impractical heat that has flooded social media sends yet another great creation to the Catwalk – a beachfront basket as big as the model that envisions it.
The deep orange bast basket, with bast fringes and a white song handle, was the main focus in the La-Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus on the Paris fashion weeks.
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see great heat and beach baskets on our streets next summer – because designers have made such a big impact, it’s hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are indispensable for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools hold the record for academic achievement and this one went ahead in 2018 with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened through individual and collective achievement in sport, art, music and other societal endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work for their students to prepare for further and higher schools, for their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational institution with an agreed and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as beloved and desired subjects in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to the heart."
This is a strong reminder that we are not only allowed to trust in English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Since this exam, we can see that languages are at the very top, with the best results within the independent schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages had an A+ cut off.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of the students had an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as elective subjects are now considered to be the same as major subjects (sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also in a different context.
A survey by the English Commission on Vocational and Skills in 2014 found that patrons indicated that it was difficult to fill free positions, 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming increasingly important for young people to prepare for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities that require languages, these skills are becoming more and more important in a global world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, when one has learned a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England from 2013, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French as a single language with 15 percent still comes into the second-tier area.
That is why it is so important to invest in the learning of languages in today's children.
Multilingualism, especially those of growing economies, offers children better opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school offers different languages.
A handful of schools are focusing on the more classically modern languages, while others are learning languages that may be more important to England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are always a variety of languages and independent schools to choose from, with teaching staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are keen to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be disputed in a global business environment that languages are vital to the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages have to be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer this whale, variety and immersive performance for the young people of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is directly in the Scottish Red Cross for independent schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans, who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers has announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
You just have to figure out how many minutes it takes.
"They're more like one and less like 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As a winner, James was asked at the beginning of this week how his plans for the Lakers' six-player preseason program are.
"I don't need a pre-season player at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's visit to West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins the evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a hell of a whale event campaign.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him in friendly sunny spots like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the run-up to his election to the post of Chief Justice, Trump is aiming for support for the upcoming mid-term elections, since Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia election night and how do you view it online?
Trump's whale event for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight's evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would be named this week's nominee for the same harbor-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, whose whale has been on ice for a week over allegations of sexual abuse with a former senator, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help the Republicans face off against the whales in November and get a new swing.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said the five events in the next week aimed to "give volunteers and supporters new energy while Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels as much as possible during the important period of the campaign in as many states," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the whale event can bring in evening supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be treated by the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senatorial candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is returning to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him get up and running," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018 U.S. team proves courage to fight for the hopes of keeping the singles fight a Sunday alive
After three one-on-one sessions, a four-on-one match could be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swing swing pendulum is a very invented sports concept, but one that the players believe in, and never more so than in competitions such as these.
Where are you going to tell me that it's a scam?
"They had a lead of six points and now there are four more, so we now see this as a small swing hole," said Jordan Spieth, as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points lead with another twelve to play.
The Americans, as the Spieth says, feel a little wall in their sails and they have a lot to be assembled, not to mention the shape of the Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and both of them score three out of four points.
Spieth was deadly from tea to green and is an example.
The joyful Kielgei<0xC3><0x9F> became harder as his round progressed, sinking an important pit to tear the match apart and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His putt, through which they won the match at 15, was met with a similar crush, of that sort, a son that he believes the American team is not out there.
"You just have to take a deep breath and take care of your own game," he said.
That's all that's left of this game.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but love couples they four out of four before and can do nothing more wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only group that didn't shoot a Saturday afternoon Bogey, but they also avoided the Saturday afternoon, Friday and the nine back a Friday morning Bogeye as well.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow with and from the spectators, cemented that they are the players who are supposed to beat it a Sunday, and there will be no more favorite players to win a potential European victory when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National, like the forest.
It's best to put the two of them in different places at the same time.
However, it is still a matter of time before a European victory is declared.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, Moien's hero in the Fourball, when a couple was with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in a smile, from which they soon ceased to emerge.
There's no one there to help you laugh.
The four-balls and four-players are so fascinating to look at because of the interactions between the group formations; the board they give; the board they don't give in the way a strategy can change in a way.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is going well for the last day and leadership, but this four-player meeting also showed that the U.S. team has the will to fight for what has been doubted, especially the Stateside.
Europe will go 10-6 to the Ryder Cup final day
Europe have a healthy advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after Fourth Ball of a Samsden in the Fourth Match against the USA with 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the game with two victories over a fluctuating Tiger Woods to lead this lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy two years ago to Hazeltine, dominates a poorly started American side in the four-balls, the series sitting at 3-1.
The U.S. offers more resistance in the four, winning two matches, but they do not get the deficit recorded.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 individual matches to get a probe for the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row while in the Molinari, along with "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend only the second pair are the four points since the first four games in Ryder's Cup history.
Against the Woods and Patrick Reed won in the four-ball, they harmonize well against an empty Woods and American starter Bryson Dechambeau in a sympathetic 5&4.
The Woods, who took himself through two games at Samsden, showed Heiansdo brilliant breakout in the four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, embroiled in then-four-ball Moies, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the Fours and beat Dustin Johnson in Brooks Koepka - the first and third in the world with 2&1.
Europe doesn't just have it on a beautiful, sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pace for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They picked up a rough 2&1 win over spinners Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth round and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth round, where they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to the singles, although Furyk's side only needs to contribute to the trophy.
After they were second best for two days, as always, a counterattack on Sunday looked like not wanted by them.
North Korea says 'in no case' would be unilaterally disarmed without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would "defend the measures against the United States and there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally equip its nuclear weapons under such conditions."
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea has shown a lot of "good will" in the past year, as the stops of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site, and Zouso's nuclear weapons and nuclear technology do not expand further.
"No matter what, we don't see an equal response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such conditions, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to a denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for repeating the single step, he stressed his statement in which he did not explicitly abandon a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had always done in the past.
The Ri addresses a joint letter from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit testing an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to relax international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "denuclearization-first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to impose itself in a coercive manner, and raises Asproch against "declaration of the end of war," the Ri said.
"The perception that the sanctions could drag us to our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
"But the problem is that the sanctions are going to destroy our trust."
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which a U.S. leader first announced a week before the United Nations.
The minister, on the other hand, has held three meetings with Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: "If the party for the denuclearization of South Korea were not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a case."
Just like that, the sound of Ri's speech was dramatic compared to that of last year, when it was announced before the UN General Assembly that the targets on the U.S. mainland of North Korean missiles were fired by the "Lord Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the first steps towards disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and sanctions must be imposed until North Korea passes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have said that the United Nations Security Council will reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue and in any case be carried out until we have achieved a complete, definitive and proven denuclearization."
The Security Council has tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in the hope that it could undermine Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs through the use of funds.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit is not a good one.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced him for his "gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon on that mountain, North Korea pledged to demonstrate a missile site and also a nuclear complex, should the Americans take "dementary measures."
He said Kim would use "demonstrative measures" to look for security guarantees that Trump has secured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have a lot of experience.
A new course at Harvard University allows all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to combat the growing macho culture in which someone with caffeine in the blood spends the night.
One academic found that college students, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in the women's hospital of Brigham, compiled the course, which is the first in the area in America for him.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the four-day period, a girl came to me and said, 'Why should I pay for this now, in my last year?'
He said that so far no one has told him about the importance of sleep – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Cour, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep habits can help academics and athletic performance, as well as how a general well-being can bring with it.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business leader of the university's health services, said the university has decided to offer the course after noting that students had a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a variety of interactive tasks.
In part, an image of a dorm room is shown, where students can click on cafes, rides, sports chants and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lute, but also how sports performance of sleep is affected and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another part, learning that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know that – just as one has a right to know what health problems the fumes of cigarettes bring with them,” added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of learning to break up all night long still exists, according to the professors, and the modern technology and pressure on the students, which is getting bigger, has as a consequence a lack of sleep and is a problem that is getting bigger and bigger.
He said that ensuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of “secret weapon” against stress, overexertion, and fear – even to prevent one from contributing, want to shift the lack of sleep and hunger, and one has the feeling of always being hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, even after choosing one of his courses in the last year and his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to invite the court to the entire university.
He hopes, in a next step, to bring all doctoral students to it, to complete a similar study program, before they join the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when they should go to bed, but also for getting up, and watch out for the harmful effects of "bloody light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights and which can slow down and slow down over the course of the day.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Goal by Menga beats Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered a further defeat by Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little-to-nothing side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side have tried to secure their first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard's second defeat and 18 players as a coach with them and left him eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
The menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime and the line-up of the Rangers team felt it was inspired and could not reach.
While the Rangers are now slipping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian through the difference in goals.
And there could be further problems reaching the Rangers after the Abiter Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, and that due to an object that was apparently shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard switched sides eight times, which gave him the opportunity to leave Ayr behind and come to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the same Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week and he would have been thrilled how his well-drilled team here have managed opponents all the time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more to do with the ball they had taken.
They could have scored a goal two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder had his big chance too.
A deep freeze by Keaghon Jacobs on captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the opportunity to shoot from afar on the post.
The Rangers were able to win control, but it looked more like hope than belief in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly had the feeling that he had been granted an elfmeter after a quarter of an hour when he joined Steven Lawless, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers scored just twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly has almost no problem defeating Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be considered a run against the game, no one could claim they didn't deserve it all for this effort.
Again, the Rangers tried to come to terms with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball in front of Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and selected the crowd for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard responded at the break and Coulibaly went out against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the striker overtook Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came up from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halket taking one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of this lead in their last moments, but McGregor held Jacobs the bass before lithgow shot a corner from afar.
The Rangers here traded Glenn Middleton a further late right on an elfmeter as he went with Jacobs against each other, but the Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The inventor of the violinist
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago to the day exactly, and still further TAKEN ... the scout physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Violinist was born in Germany.
The violin has developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the violin scorer.
The violinist, since becoming a mainstay of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who matched more cowboys as scientists:
Man: "What is it then?"
Rogers: "It's a target that's used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you listen to the headphone, you can hear the effects that come out of the atoms through the radioactivity and the minerals."
He said, "Well, now it's going to blow up!"
The "Hans" violinist died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his name is still in use after his death.
New cancer vaccine may be able to detect the presence of bacterial cells in the immune system
New cancer vaccine may be able to detect and kill the immune system's bile-like cells
Vaccination adds to the immune system, as it can recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the method, immunity cells are taken from a patient and then transformed in the lab.
They can then detect a protein that is present in many cancer cells and then re-injected.
A test vaccine has many promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who was treated with the vaccine, which adds malignant cells to the immune system, the cancer of the prostate gland disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, then converted in the lab, so that they recognize a protein from many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells bounce back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and cervical cancer, as Prof Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "adding" them, as one cancer cell attack has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has started a pro-Trump tirade, with a MAGA cap, following his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West was tapped into the studio during Saturday Night Live, after a lengthy performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate for 2020.
After he sang his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town, he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Great, protested against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So often I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
So if I were to deal with racism, I'd be out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star jokes about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not transferred, West's Tirade was uploaded through the social media of comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the Rock was trying to get rid of the West.
The West has also complained to the public that he has backstage problems due to his head.
"They've hit me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out like that with the cap."
They've been harassing me!
And then they said that I'm sorry," he said, as the Washington Examiner said.
The West went on to say, "You want to see that beautiful place?", filled with a statement that "he would wear his Superman costume, no one can tell me what I can do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to read it."
His comments were on at least two occasions brought with them by the audience and the SNL cast looked as if it were embarrassing to them, as Variety wrote, and one person told the publication as follows: "Around the whole studio it was totally quiet."
The West replaced singer Ariana Grande in the last minute, who wanted his colleague, rapper Mac Miller, to die two days earlier.
The West irritated others with the performance of the song I Love It, wanting to be treated like a perrier’s bottle.
The West has received support from conservative group TPUSA's four-member group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of those bravest heads: THANK YOU, THAT YOU'RE HEALING THE MOB D'STIER."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is simply "who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I choose to reward DOGEINT (by buying his music or clothes or his 'art') where I want to spread a harmful ideology that could be like doing my community.
He's free.
"We are too," she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and that he would now be called "the artist who used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and so follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the later musical Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."
Try Morduklo over knife-picking at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendants will be tried before the Belfast Magistrates' Court.
The Uklo's points are reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been accused of masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his pivotal role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of macho hero and says that such roles on screen young men often give the feeling that they need to mimic the strong man to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, the kit said it wanted to "have something gone wrong" and questioned how one should address the problem of masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admits that he is "quite strong" on the subject.
"I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where did we go with masculinity?" he said.
"What did we do when we were young, and what did we do when we were young?"
The kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of male-dominated masculinity, precisely because of its extremely masculine characters.
He says, "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, that young men like to be the worst of the certain side of man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
"There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to make a four-or-a-half story of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that he has enough of "battlegrounds and horses".
From November, the kit is worth seeing in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor once said that he found the kennels of his wife Rose the best thing that came from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in that series, so in that sense they gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love of kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the behest of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has risen by 14%.
Health experts say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
All of the 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which marks an end result.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly distributed through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV along the way had shrunk to almost zero, Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate protection in their relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to get the problem under control.
Maxine Waters denies that Maturity Workers leaked data from GOP senators, talking about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denied the Saturday rumors that a member of these math workers had published personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers of this Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat has said that the allegations of "extremely right-wing" figures were presented on websites.
"Legs, leagues and even more disgusting leagues," the Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the information released were apparently also private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information has appeared online, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the breach had a line to the Waters office, and they have released information about a member of the Waters Maturity Workers, lawmakers told The Hill.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and an absolute lie," the Waters said.
“The member of my Maturity Officers – whose identity, personal information, and safety and security are the result of those dishonest and false allegations – has nothing to do with leaking this information at all.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statements quickly found criticism online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This demented rose is a rose," the flesh wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If a person is accused of having committed something that he did not commit, then he should not be a rose.
You shouldn't dare.
You don't have to ask the friends of the deceased.
There has to be a calming and calming."
The butcher manifested himself in order to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who had been accused by critics of rosing during the swearing-in ceremony.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is undeterred against the water and the middlemen, has also released his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great," he tweeted.
In this statement, the Waters said that this office "has informed the appropriate authorities and the person responsible for the application of the law about these false allegations."
"We are confident that your guilt will come to the light of day," she continued, "and that they will be held responsible for here actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review – Little Intoxicating Rowan Atkinson Parody
It has become a tradition now to look into all new British films for Brexit footage, which in its revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise did not work properly. This started in 2003 and was re-launched in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Do you think it's worth it to be honest with yourself about this country's potential for economic growth?
No matter how, the glottal-eyed and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his patent for a second time to swallow everything – the name of him already seems enough, and indeed, that is a wide-ranging comedy creation that has appeared for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, a domestic secret agent who, although having a comedic reputation for idiotic glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a klack of the type who has a single note to the "Chariots of Fire" chief at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also actually based on the traveler and international man of mystery who once played the Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
There will be one or two good moments in this current Johnny English film.
I was fascinated by the scene where Johnny English comes to a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades briefly flap against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor feels "subdued" and comically overwhelming, especially the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible want to offer even now with more convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for children and not adults, and for me Johnny English's silly mass adventures are simply not as original and focused as the Atkinson's bold sketcher in the character of the bean.
The current situation in the UK is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret Internet network of spies in the UK, revealing the identities of all the agents in Asaatz – unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the latest drops that bring the facade to the surface for the Prime Minister, a pompous and combative figure who is already in a total collapse of political impropriety: Emma Thompson makes her mark with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not popular.
Here are the secrets of each spy and the danger that they will have to bring back one from retirement.
And that means the muttering Johnny English in person, now employed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who, however, secretly gives courses like one gives a spy: a few loving jokers here, want to set up the English an Art School of Rock-major spy school.
The Englishman has been sent back to Whitehall for a brief briefing and emergency and reunite with his old-timed sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
The Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role in which the Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin are all wrong but in the name of the majesty of this secret service back in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife Fatale, the Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling for a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough here begin an odyssey of farce-exchange maneuvers: disguised as servers, they set a French restaurant on fire; they care for chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and the English leave some anarchy as he tries to escape a virtual reality headquarters.
All the sketches are sure to be taken out for the last sequence, but so friendly and burschikos is everything, it already has something of a children's television in general.
It's kind of mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't relate to myself: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is fair to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for Britain to start a four-day week, which will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party considers a radical plan in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the bosses of companies to restore the gains they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend – but the same would be paid.
Sources say that the idea would coincide with the party's economic agenda and also with plans to lease the land and favor the worker.
Switching to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a way for workers to become the advantages of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth going overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and favor of the employee and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to put such an idea behind it, which had already been discussed in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
At the moment, however, this is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference of last week to forge his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of "faceless dictators" and "profits" from caring companies.
The shadow chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies could not recoup investors here if a Labour government could demand certain "deductions" on the basis of wrong practices.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the fourth tier of companies and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund is to give 10% of the profits of private sector companies to employees who could then receive dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy said "60 Minutes," whether Kavanaugh's research here could change opinions.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a last-ditch vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the Bureau's findings could convince Republican senators to support it in any way.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI might find out something new that would lead them to change their mind here.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina co-worker.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"As I entered the audience, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened here, this seizure came out, and he really said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, determined."
But Graham's voice seems to be written in stone.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and there has to be a particularly strong commitment to change them," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: The board fought it very hard," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"All the people they call can't verify anything.
It's been 36 years here.
I don't see anything that could change the situation."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday was once again held in New York City the Global Citizen Festival, an annual muséks event that showcased an immensely impressive line-up of stars who performed but had an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is attracting thousands of people to Central Park's "Great Lawn" to not only see such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw people's attention to the true goal of the event, from extreme to extreme.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights against poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the people who go to the concert have to do a number of tasks but, or "actions" such as working as a volunteer, write an email to a leader in the world, call someone or other tasks that will help you reach the goal of poverty.
But how many successful global citizens, with only 12 years to go, have achieved their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way to demand from people that they become active, or again a further case of “clicktivism” – people who would like to make a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million "shares" of these supports, which are aligned with various targets.
They say the actions have kept them from bringing global leaders to announce commitments and unlock policies of more than $37 billion, worth more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and reports that come from these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the collected money has so far had an impact on nearly 649 million people in the world.
One of the main commitments is, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and investors committed to “helping children live out their full potential,” and promises to – after they have received more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens – reach out to 35 million people.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can bring social injustice from malnutrition to a foothold in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the audience of the Live Abconcert in London in 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions have been addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government has announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which aims to provide more than 5 million women and children with nutrition.
To the answer of an FAQ on the website, which asks "what makes you think that you can end extreme poverty?"
In response, the Global Citizen said: “It’s worth a long and hard way – Heiansdo will fall and fail me.
But, like all major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, if we were successful, we would like to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are just a few of the artists who will be performing in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The U.S. could use a naval blockade to restrict Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington said it would "as necessary" deploy the Navy here to stop Russian energy from coming to the Marches, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia’s commitment to Syria – where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is all but a bulwark to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, they want to consume energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe him, there are always ways to go about it.
"The United States of America has the opportunity, with our Navy, to make sure that seaways are on, and, if necessary, to block to make sure that energy does not come on the market here," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared the approaches of Washington vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Russia and Iran and noted that in the end they are the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are, more or less, about exerting pressure and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claim comes as Trump's administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exporters to Europe to replace Russia, which is a significantly more burdensome option for European consumers.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which – if one listens to Trump – would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a few economic projects.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for the consumer to decide on this provider," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has been met with criticism from Germany, which once again reaffirmed Asaatz's commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the dark main organization for industry, has called on America to stand out from the EU's energy policy and bilateral relations between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Elisabeth Warren is worth a good look at whether she will run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "look good" if she went into the race for the presidency after the midterms.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the wardens confirmed they were considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and flirt with our fuzzy government and that also means a woman at the top," she said, according to voices from The Hill.
"On November 6th, I'm looking forward to being president and running for president."
During the event, President Donald Trump criticized the warnings, saying that he would "lead the country in a wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
The war has so far been open with criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, Frieden said the warnings "of course we need an FBI investigation before being elected."
It's been a long time coming, but it's clear that Warren isn't going to want to lose his own election in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters are of the opinion that they should not be uninvited.
Twenty-three percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that more support is there for the governor of Vidrun, Deval Patrick, with eighty-three percent who are in favour of it, and forty-five percent who are against it.
Other high-profile Democrats named in the context of the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would officially decide on it until January, according to the Associated Press.
D'Sarah Palin mentions the track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
Palin, 26, was a year old in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He has been arrested and charged with domestic violence in the past.
"What my buff goes through, what he's been through since he's been home again, I can relate to other families struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries with which our soldiers are coming back," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa.
Palin called his capture as "the elephant in the room" and said that their son and other veterans "have come back a little differently, they are more eager, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, have accompanied."
He has been arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault against a woman, along with the report on general domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state, including then-Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support challenges for new asylum policy
Eighteen states in the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states in the district issued a memo "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace vs. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She said her partner "in his violent constructions that are gang members" had been harassed, but U.S. officials had filed for asylum here on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states here advocate for the Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of claims for U.S. asylum come, as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has changed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, attorney general of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that the new policy would "ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum seekers be granted the facts and conditions of the petition, and such a court goes against the principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affections continue to argue in the memo that the policy would not allow immigrants entry, which would hurt the U.S. economy, they would likely want to become entrepreneurs, and an "important offer from employers."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June demanded that judges only grant asylum to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on their race, religion, nationality or want to be a member of a particular social group or political opinion," the sessions said on June 11 in its policy presentation.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubles compared to the survivors
As a result, the situation became increasingly untenable.
"It feels like everything is going to be fine," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tries to calm her little five-year-old baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there's an ambulance.
There's almost no clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to destroyed homes here, looking through watered-down properties to be able to save whatever they have.
Hundreds of people were blessed and the hospitallers, damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the judge's scale, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured back and shoulder, rushed outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated for the unbearable injuries outside.
When he told of the feeling when it was at the 5th stack in the hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter, to experience a brutal earthquake, he received tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been thrown into the ruins of the walls, I love it," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying, but it wasn't right.
I don't know what's going on with me or my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad praising the beneficiaries of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. daily, the U.S. ambassador to China Beijing accused the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China’s ad on the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after a China pled guilty to attempting to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China disputed.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, according to a U.S. official.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for trade, Beijing and Washington are facing a descaling trade war, which has led to higher tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to meet exporters from states like Iowa – which support Trump’s Republican Party – as well as Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa – a major export state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do as it does.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now taking a leap forward by now turning propaganda ads into our free press."
"Through the spread of propaganda, the government of China is opposing the cherished and long-standing tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," it said.
"In contrast, at the newspaper stand below on the street of Beijing, one finds few opposition votes and is not worth finding a proper reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese could have against the economic development of their country, the media of the Chinese Communist Party wants to control," he said.
He also said that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers did not want to print his article", although he did not know how to.
The Republican Party's decision to ban women's suffrage in the wake of Kavanaugh's death, analysts have warned.
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are standing up and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a backlash in the middle east, especially from women.
The sentiments around this subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Such things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke with The Hill for an article published Sunday.
Reeher said Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had his last-minute push for an FBI investigation only worth bringing with him pink picks.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they don't forget it tomorrow and also not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, who is pleased if one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Freedom Movement, as they walked out of the Senate bench, chanted "November is coming!" while the Republicans, who control the "judicial committee," opted to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine-Bericht and Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely valuable," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; that's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among the so-called "swing voters", in the quarter-finals and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who – although they did not like the president – often do not get elected.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which they give an accurate description of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest it could be reversed if Republicans go ahead with the confirmation.
"It's a confusing time for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican quarterback of the National Committee, at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be the judge, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps Democrats be elected to a television show.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about what they should believe from the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the slanderer more.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or possibly believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely performed during his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about the Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other Ukloerin, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford issued an oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had abused them in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominees exposed his genitals at a party.
The founder of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is supposed to be a competition from Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored here and who may have access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind the break-in was "the world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to record their own "personal online data store" or a POD here.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like when Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all come together on a browser, and that's all the time.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is completely dependent on the user, who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, process qualifications, and adapt to be so solidly accessible to everyone.
The company is currently based out of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few math workers who work as project developers in a community of volunteer coders.
From that week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app here with the tools to be found on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: 1st World War Pasteur celebrated with "Victoria cross"
The only clergyman from the Church of England who was awarded a "Victoria Cross" as a fighter during the First World War was celebrated in his home village after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was kidnapped four days later by a sniper and never admitted that he had been given the highest British military honor.
A commemorative stone was unveiled at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "genius symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his father, who gave him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through decrepit Niwwel and under attack on the field and by machine guns."
He later landed at the firing range and again led the battalion, before taking a field weapon with one hand and holding up three of the military units.
The Lt Col Vann was captured on October 4, 1918 by a German sniper – just over a mountain before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said he could not be justified in his grandfather's actions "but it would be a humble experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also wore a wreath after the parade, on which the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band was leading.
Michael Vann says that he "feels very honored to be a part of the parade" and has also said that "the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this: you've stayed up all night to watch a packed Bellator 206, only to get the views of the main property there refused.
The schedule included 13 fights from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown live on Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to argue against each other, the audience in the United Kingdom was stunned when the report was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were undeterred, after they had been extra vigilant for the fight until the early months.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government requirement that at 6 a.m. the content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, as he was approached about the transfer.
""Peppa the pig," yo."
Bellator company president Scott Coker has said that they want to work on their schedule to accommodate viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably do that," Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock in the morning and we're not able to hold this until Sunday our time, rather their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was switched there, they were sent a lot of messages here and they were not all friendly.
We tried to do it, but we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a real problem.
I can assure you that it won't happen again.
We’re reducing the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we’ve tried to deliver more, but we’ve banned it.
It's a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has become "manly" in his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he had grown up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he was in high school that "not everyone is like me."
In a conversation with the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had talked about the rights of gays to be "hopeful" to others.
He also said that to give a parent, he was told that he was less likely to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to an illness.
In her appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he had the feeling in adulthood that he "would be less worthy" than anyone else, because "socially it was not accepted to love boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, the feelings of being less and different have been the only things that have given us the strength and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone if they eventually found out his sexual preferences.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics is one of the most well-known LGBT advocates and he used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he said this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences and want to make others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me”.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When one does so young, so through" - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died three years later in cancer - he said that it was difficult to find someone who was as old as him in the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His father, Robert, has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not here to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped with Ootmen and it was only when he stopped with Ootmen and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was the place I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a gathering of people at home at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
This was also inspired by the choice of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympic Games and still caused a hamstring with him.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event, which takes place every 2 years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four a Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he has done so often for the United States, the five main winners spent his day there playing cheerleaders and working on the range in his game, in the hope of improving what he plots.
Not even at the peak of his career, he was the most popular driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal lineup for the tight bottom of Le Golf National, where the long rough routine feels like a penalty shot.
And when the ties aren't scary enough, Mickelson meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in the ninth game, who is teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans with four points behind start the 12 individual games, have a difficult start, then the match of Mickelson could prove to be absolutely important.
The man's confidence in his father's words is not that he can't say anything else.
"He understood his role for today fully and completely, folded me on my back, put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the roster and he's been in the past and this week as well as joining these teams.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I thought it would work, but that's how it worked and how we thought it would work.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could represent the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really reached the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought the team far more tangible benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's moody, he likes to be funny about others and he's a wonderful person who loves someone in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun when they were with him along the way, and also this week, which was fun to watch.
It's more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lead can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can be very quickly converted into an uncomfortable horse.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it just went on to win the night with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but also just barely," said Bjorn, after he took the class of 2018 with a 10th overall finish.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over yet.
Give me everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and then we have to continue to focus.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Eased as his players hit a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
We've got another one in front of us.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that make up, and that's another couple of shocks.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested as a golfer to the blood.
That's the message the player needs to convey: Get your best tomorrow.
Now let your partner go back and he has to go his own way and also be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better than they did as a partner, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
The Fury himself knows both sides of those big twists, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they went as losers of the spot, as Europe played out the "wonders of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question when Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, collected his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd love to catch the quick start that you saw at Brookline, that you saw at Medina.
If the pendulum swings in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the midfielders.
"We've put together a list of the people we've met, and we've made sure that we're able to do that tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to outrun the crowd and is pitted against Rory McIlroy in the lead role, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other half of the lineup.
"I chose this position because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
Germany's new warship is back on the line
The newest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but there is, according to local media, due to faulty systems and increasingly larger costs not completed before at least the next year.
The order of the "Rhineland-Palatinate," the main ship of the frigate class Baden W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg has now been lost, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", citing a military spokesman, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to contribute to the Navy in 2014, but the alarming problems after delivery have seen the fate of the ambitious project at home.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class, which the Navy ordered already in 2007, are thought to be the legacy of the aging frigates of the Bremen-class.
They have an impact-resistant gun, a burst of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible that the next frigates will not run the home for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove to Germany its power of battle and beyond – that they are already weathered before they fail the service at all, notes "Die Zeit".
Last year, the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" by which the ship would have rendered useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors – even half the staff of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship has too much weight, which reduces its performance and enhances the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class employed by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – is also a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – of the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are especially important in light of recent warnings that the German naval strike force is abandoning.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, conceded that the Navy would "exit the ships capable of carrying them".
Officials said that the problem has worsened over time, as old ships are being docked, but no new ships are being prepared.
He claimed that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of Flanders
A new research, which is set on a plot in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how flantermais use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the behaviour of the unique migratory animals and, in addition, help to provide guidelines for future conservation activities.
The study is being conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and tracks common and mecca bats as well as brown langour and daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at important locations around the basepiece, to monitor the batting activities throughout the season.
The staff of the NHS and volunteers also carry out mobile recording with the help of hand detectors.
In-depth expert analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of the flanter mouse circuitry and what kind of thing it does.
A map and a report of the living space are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, consultant for nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living space are most important for the bats and how they are used in any way.
This information will help determine the benefits of living space management work, such as how to best manage the creation of knowledge and how to best manage small prayers for bats and other similar species.
The population of the bat has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are characterized by buildings and development work, which affect sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Wandriders and lightning can also pose a risk, just like mechanized and chemical treatments of building materials, but also attacks of house casings.
Flannel isn't really white.
But based on their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the fangs of prey.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the operation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important estates and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes Flanders very seriously.
They have trained ten experts who regularly conduct recordings, sleep-place inspections, and heiansdo rescues.
The organisation even set up Scotland's first and only designated batting reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides a living space for eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Land plot manager David Thompson says that the plot is the ideal landscape for them.
"We've got a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, and that's where the work we're doing here and elsewhere helps us better understand what they need to be able to do."
He stressed the importance of looking for bats, before a maintenance is carried out on grounds, because an insignificant destruction of a single breeding habitat of up to 400 women and young bats can be carried out and, therefore, possibly a very local population.
Flankworms are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their life frame.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to do so, urging them to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations will fare."
Ronaldo has been accused of raping a man and his lawyer wants to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charge against him a "false report" by saying that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyer wants to expose the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" which published the false allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 to not bring the incident to public attention, the "mirror" reported Friday.
As he spoke to his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video hours after being reported about the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, disputed the reports as "false reports."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false reports," the fifth winner of the Ballon d'Or and the camera said.
"She wanted to advertise for herself by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy and very good man," added the player with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to denounce the "mirror" for the false accusations they call "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player wants a decision for "moral arbitration with a thumb that corresponds to the sword of violation, which will be one of the most difficult interpretations against personal rights in recent years".
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the rooms of the player where he had been, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada alleged anal rape.
D'Mayorga claimed Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and had said he was at "99 percent" a "good deal" apart from that "close percent."
The documents claimed Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that a mutual acquiescence had taken place.
The Mayorga also claimed that he had gone to the police, and that he had photos of his injuries that were shot in the hospital, but had later agreed to solve the case <0xC3><0xA0> l'amiable, because he was "deeply afraid of retaliation" and feared "measures of retribution."
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was just about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he traded a 100-million-dollar deal with the Italian top-flight Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "would prepare it for forever" to lose automakers
The United Kingdom "would prepare it forever" if it were to lose its status as the world's leading car manufacturer, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, in the Derby area.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the effects of delays on the border could cost jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have also raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says they will close their mini-factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what, according to automakers, are life-cycle risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "synchronously," with parts that meet every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK as well as from the EU for cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be an interruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks at parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock of more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and as a result, production would stop.
Mr Clark told Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We absolutely need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The outcome is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, that we need to be absolutely in a position to anticipate what has been an extremely successful batch of Livwerkettes."
Toyota was not in a position to say how long production would have been stopped, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union boss of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein will be postponed, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's impeached meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed for another week," as the fight over candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Sonneraffekot Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible Russian meddling in whales, is considering connections between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy justice minister and put Mueller's independence at stake has been the number one topic of conversation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about being betrayed, to record conversations with Trump, and about the possibility of the president resigning over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein disagreed with the report.
But last month he went to the White House and, according to reports, he was able to get on with it.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to "get out" of Rosenstein, but you were promised the meetings to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee's impeachment, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, all accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump called for an FBI investigation into a week of allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There has not been a date set for it yet, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to leave it a week after, with all the other things that are left in the Supreme Federal Court.
But I'm still looking forward to it, and I'm always looking forward to it."
Some reporters have raised the allegation and question: Sanders has not held a press briefing from the White House since September 10.
Hosted by Chris Wallace.
Sanders felt that the lack of information sources did not result from an aversion to television reporting, which is based on "effect hacking," even though she admitted, "I don't dispute the fact that they're running effect hacking."
She suggested that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him," she said, adding without proof: "We've looked at the numbers."
Information rounds are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen that we've done a lot in the last few weeks, and that will replace a press briefing in the future if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump responds to regular questions when he leaves the White House, or attends open meetings or talks with reporters on a visit to press conferences.
Press conferences alone are souls.
In New York this week, the president may have proven why, by making a lab-like and heinous bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU co-workers on NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (National Health Service) to express the gratitude of the country and wished that they would also remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to take over the costs of an application for a fair status for EU citizens who work in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The summer over is preceded by negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU over the withdrawal and it is heading towards expected decisions for this autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also raised its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be an exciting time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, where patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay."
The death of Christie Abercrombie
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has had an emergency surgery following a head injury at the 31:27 low against the Wanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury happened shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the saddle and broke down there," said the horse.
The coaches and medical staff gave the Abercrombie oxygen on the saddle and put him on a beer and brought him back for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operation.
Harris added that there is "no detail as to the nature/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a college athlete in his 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a plot of land in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they purchase a plot of land in the United Kingdom, in which case the additional tax under the Tory Plan will be used to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Finance ministry experts expect to climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy a plot of land in the United Kingdom, where the additional tax under the Tory Plan will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May says today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attract young voters with promises, prepare more viable housing, and aim for well-wishers.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, in which case the additional money will strengthen the government's fight against sleep on the streets.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels, which were introduced two years ago to second-rate earners and cafe-for-lose-homes – could amount to up to three percent.
Finance ministry experts expect the step to be worth <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-united kingdom citizens, driving prices into the sky and making it difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in residential construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – are turning into “spirit cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guideline comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty to help younger people own their first home.
He has accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by buying up land, but not using it, and he has urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on last-ditch homes, in order to meet the "cost of living" of the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a conspicuous rush of housing reform proposals, including rent checks and an end to forced evictions "without hiding".
He also wants to give the community more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would use my time as Prime Minister to revive the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
That's why it's important to repair the squeaky wheel.
The UK is always open to people who live, work and want to build a life.
It may not be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign companies, to buy homes such as British breweries.
For too many people, the dream of home is too far away and the awakening of sleep on the street remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is right in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer, after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership (Scotland's 1st League) in the last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of players from Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid and that's something that always drew me back.
"It's only a matter of time before I get to the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he is not afraid to follow such established takeovers at such a large club, where he has previously sided with offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successfully, the appeal for me is to ask, 'Can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and equipment at this club, it belongs to the Premier League without a doubt," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months with coaching staff from Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the injury in the third league and turn St Mirren from injury candidate to the championship title winner in the following season.
In Ross's words, he now feels more likely than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a stretch," he remembers when he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was right for me to play even more than that.
It sounds strange, but I hit myself well, can live well there and have enjoyed some well-founded highs.
But it can make sense.
There's a lot that needs to be done every week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure through the work, but the administration just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now where I do it feels like the best thing I've done in my entire life as an adult."

The summer heat wave has boosted the recipes of British pubs struggling for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar groups experienced a 2.7 percent increase in July – but recipes and restaurants returned 4.8 percent, as the figures prove.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Unseen sunshine and the longer-awaited participation of England in the World Cup has resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when the pubs have stood out 2.8 percent more than other restaurants.
The decline of 1.8 percent in June's recovery continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars and those that are drunk have been cut far more heavily than the restrooms have been.
The food and drinks in the restaurant are also served in the sun, although not as good as the food in the restaurant.
It's as if people are just trying to get something to drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, the drink sales went up by 6.6 percent on that mountain, while food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman of leisure and hotel analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling out-of-home merchandise.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent year-on-year sales drop is in addition to the relentless boxing press doing particularly well.
The long extremely hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August are bringing so much expected otampus."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, climbed by 2.7 percent, which also reflects the slowdown in brand new restaurants.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some of them just 11 – has secret social media accounts, according to a survey, which they hide from their parents and schoolteachers.
The number of students in the school's 20,000-strong secondary school has dropped to a record high in "false insta" pages.
The news has sparked fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children – part of which is just 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found a rapid spike in “false insta” accounts – a spillover to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The message has sparked fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they would operate a discounted "main account" that they would show to parents while also having a private one.
A mother who stalked the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called out, "rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which would have allowed them to operate private accounts.
HMC's Mike Buchanan said: "It's heartbreaking that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and schoolteachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Speechwriter of the Athletes' at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the Supervisory Board as a Supervisory Board member.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete and twenty-one Ian Beattie saw the step as a significant opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their broad-based experience at an international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect in the athletics community across Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we took the shot," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm delighted to act as a lingua franca for the athletes and I hope I can really contribute something and help introduce the sport to Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter lap at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and owns a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transient ischemic attack.

I couldn't go.
The doctors said, only with time, it becomes clear whether and to what extent I recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to go again and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for the uplifting messages!"

A company for milk pumps has reached out to the crowd online with an ad that compares stealing moms with cows.
For the launch of the so-called "world's first inconspicuous portable milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a non-exclusive music-video-inspired ad, to celebrate the freedom that mothers – the mothers – share with mothers.
Four real moms dance in a high-filled chest to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I stroke myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't ears that are my breasts."
The chorus continues, "Pump of, pump of, I'll feed my baby, pump of, pump of, I'll sprinkle my ponds."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it evokes the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a bad decision to use this product.
"Genes like us have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the exception that their babies are taken away a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie's milk pump discreetly fits in the breast pads (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Considerable traumatized both for the mother and for the baby.
"Why don't you use them to make a milkshake for mothers who take care of their babies?"
Another said, "It's an unspeakable warning."
Others defended the advertisement, while a mother admitted that she found the song "immensely funny."
"I think this is a great idea.
I would buy one if I was still stealing.
I felt like I was going through a hole in the wall.
It's a bit crazy, but I've understood it as it is.
"This is a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad that appeals to moms who are pumped up (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like 'nothing'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women point out that they all danced with the discreet pumps that were placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump up milk say they feel like crap.
Elvie's doll, however, is very unobtrusive, has no third or similar and fits discreetly into a tailspin and offers women the freedom to move around, keep their dolls and even go out during the dolling.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother," commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel, between pumped mothers and milkmaids, we wanted to highlight the pumps of milk and the associated challenges and demonstrate them in a sustained and tangible way at the same time.
This isn't the first time Elaine's has made headlines.

Hundreds of Migrants Suffocated in a Tent Camp on the Border of Texas
The number of detained migrant cans has reached a peak, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the sharp rhetoric of the Trump administration and the guidelines issued by them have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared their own opportunity to stay in the country, to put on the game by reporting to pick up a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their district would have to hand over fingerprints, and that the dates would be shared with the immigration agency.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children of people who had volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been pre-condemned.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or associate members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
"We are going to go back to the old days," said Lord Albence.
In an attempt to get the children off work more quickly, officials, according to subcontractors, have introduced new rules, whereby some of them must appear in court within a month after the arrest, instead of after 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear in person via videoconferencing to advance their case for legal status to an immigration court.
Those who don't qualify for the aid are quickly disqualified.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which, according to sub-confessional workers and reports released in the last month from the system, may lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escapes.
Prosecutors have stated that these concerns are still reinforced in a larger setting such as tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs based on the size of the setting will indicate that a child is struggling with it.
They added that the granting of children to the tent city without sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or to tell friends <0xC3><0x84>ddi, the trauma with which they struggle could be even worse.
Syria demands that the U.S., France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
Before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been ongoing for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces illegally stopped on Syrian soil with the pretext of combating terrorism and "are being pursued in accordance with them".
"It has to be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn," he told the assembly.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as ever," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damascus was fighting its "holy fight until we have cleared all Syrian areas" as well as "illegal foreign presences" from terrorist groups.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said that the conditions for them to be in line to return and he called on "some Western countries" to "irrationally spread fear" that refugees have been asked to stay away.
"We have joined the international community and humanitarian organizations to ease this setback," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no build-up aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to fight the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to take place.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, insisted that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and he expressed the hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front and the visionaries who "are being ridiculed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and establish the way for whales.
Al-Moualem put conditions on the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the council should be restricted, "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump won a second term in office
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the New Year's Eve in 2020, except how many liberal viewers are likely to hope that a presidential inauguration or a scandal would take place prematurely.
It's "the most dramatic end of a presidency that's ever happened!"
But so far, there is no sign of a meeting with the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's primetime ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News had an average of 2.4 million main-event viewers, four years ago it was another 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable rating with no less than 3.5 million viewers on main-event nights.
"This is a celebration that people are sitting on because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, series director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" said of a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembered a taxi ride to Boston in front of the whale in 2016.
Chauffer told him he was going to vote for Lord Trump.
Why? he asked.
He replied, "Because he made me laugh," said the Mme. Scovell told me.
In chaos, there is a sense of calm.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the White House's actions could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigration families reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And then it surpasses the understanding of an informed citizen, when one finds himself in Washington for six hours, to watch a panel discussion by experts who discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background," which is the source for his book "Fear," published by Paul's.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he's doing is letting it feel like if there's a reality show that he's doing something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about Trump's show with rotating cast and crew.
You can't afford to miss out on something, or else you won't be able to.

It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district saw a cash deficit, thanks to the re-arrangement of congressional districts that received two officials in a race around the same seat.
This recent new suburban district of Pittsburgh is to the detriment of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a Sunday vote last spring in another district.
The Lamb is pitted against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is snowing with the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were rigged in violation of the Constitution in favor of the Republicans.
The race around the new 17th has seen a sluggish exchange of campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a narrow victory in a much-watched solar eclipse in March for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The U.S. has accused El Salvador of supporting China, but has refused to do so.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization's management team pulled out the partners.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement.
However, only punitive measures against El Salvador were tested, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, which cut financial aid payments and impose visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With the progress of internal meetings, the functionaries of North and Central America held a high-level conference with a focus on security and economic prosperity, to conclude a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in the efforts to be undertaken by the states.
But in mid-September, leading functionaries made it clear that they wanted the conference to be preceded and they thereby effectively enforced all sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now due to deliver the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for imports that the administration is putting on hold for the meetings, the diplomats said.
And the three American healers have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new scheduled messages or penalties from Washington.
A representative of the White House for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was held by the three American houses, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal beliefs about the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
The history of learning
Your next job message could be to Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal impediment, about which there is now prima facie evidence in the public files.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also wants to find out with his inquiry on Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia to attack our elections.
If Congress is to be re-assembled, then Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility before the new assembly, shortly before he has to re-evaluate the electorate, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That’s a lot of conditions, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – or that of his European counterparts.
All of us need to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this dispute.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and failed to seize the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that have ensued.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, in which democracy's ruthless march is accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is currently facing some of these challenges.
What do we do when Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who steers the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tricky situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he secretly admitted to the president and speculated that he is not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
"What will our reaction be if Brett Kavanaugh's newly-led F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is brought before the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual misconduct and dishonest testimony against him?
And, above all, are we going to elect a Congress in the middle of the day that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't do this, there will be a time for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jewess from the same Nazi regime who once occupied my embassy home and was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me off to start sabbatical candles on the table with the swastika on them.
With this in my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna is aware that the victory against the Austrians, having played impressively equal against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, will bring them into a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first match of the season since the 2-2 tie with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the belief that we were going to get something and they went home with a point.
Maybe we should have known about it in the end, but, in the grand scheme of things, a similar game is probably a pretty good result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half the better side.
This time, it's a great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but this will be a difficult match because they had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything happening with my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels good to be there now.
The team is good and the boys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
"Hopefully we can get ahead now and leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of retirement.
Although the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk to members of their family about it.
Half of the individuals in this Nationwide study said they were going to talk to their partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were going to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wish known early enough.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get support, as these choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial adviser: Your adviser may also be able to help you find an opportunity to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term care include a traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
How to make your own decisions: Conflict of interest
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person dear to your pet can check your health insurance and ensure that professionals remember your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
You should also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You will be asked to select a person you trust to make your financial decisions and to ensure that the bills are paid in the event that you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly parent had a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Do you have the ability to respond to questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a written plan so that the door is ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died during a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu de Paz, according to the Associated Press, with the expectation that the death toll will continue to rise.
Since the communication facilities were collapsing, the official help could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, a neighborhood in the north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was in the process of celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency located more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of the Sulawesi island.
The region, an administrative region under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Neck demolition is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite lit coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have often been hit by tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed as many as 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is a landlocked country and has been hit by earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the past year:
2004: A large-scale beehive off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it.
2005: A series of strong buoys hit the western coast of Sumatra ending March and beginning April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 strong beehive struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 strong beehive hit one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial blizzard hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and triggered destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly blizzard and tsunami.
No tsunami was ever triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Larger beehives hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The building has destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists temporarily on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over Uklo's domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaksa and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested over allegations of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for alleged domestic violence, allegations of domestic violence, and resistance to a detention facility, according to a report released by a joint Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from him.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He was a defendant before a court, where he declared that it was "very safe not to be guilty" when asked for a debt confession, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A convictions, which means he could go to jail for a year and get a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted of a Class B felony, punishable by a prison roof and a $2000 fine.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been dressed up.
In December 2017, he was accused of raping his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, due to domestic violence, complaint of a report of a domestic violence crime and due to possession of a gun while drunk was in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquakes Tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are out and it is expected that the number of deaths will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck a little away from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the shores.
U.S. Attorneys Want to Suspect Rare Death Penalty for NYC Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
The Saipov, 30, allegedly used a paid home depot truck to carry out the attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists who had crossed into his path in October.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "wanted" to kill eight people and "wanted" to cause serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to demand the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
The two charges could lead to a possible death sentence, according to a court filing.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury complained to Saipov about the arrest of 22 Ukloen there, which included eight killers in aid of protective money laundering, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an Uklo for violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack used "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov conducted it as "cruel, horrifying and deplorable."
"The Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov has suffered injuries, heartache, and loss to relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug addicts but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy for two years prior to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were killed on June 19, 1953 by Electric Stull.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told police he was going to be fine because of what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the complaint.
He also asked for the arrest of ISIS prisoners in his hospital room, police said.
He is not known for his 22-year-old son.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to contemplate the death penalty, instead of a debt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released, will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked not to contemplate the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should Brexit negotiations suffer
Nigel Farage swore today during a protest at a Tory conference that he would "mobilize the People's Army".
The former Ukip leader told politicians to "speak the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May has faced in bringing the deeply divided ranks back together has been underscored by pro-remaining Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been having trouble keeping track of her Chequers compromise plan around attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies have insisted that he should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and the Eurosceptics and Labour should be forced to choose either his package or ‘chaos’.
Lord Bone told the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he was going to take out the Chequers.
He suggested that the Lord Farage should have a peer and be given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he's going to die, we're going to die," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm up for Brexit but we have to get the cheques out."
To make clear his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected to.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely false."
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, telling reporters: "I'll just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers are not popular with the public, the opposition will not choose for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who are actually going through the streets and leading us to be elected at all.
When I'm done, I'm going to listen to the podcasts and listen to the podcasts."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Premiers will keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must “feel the heat” if they are to abandon the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to get away from Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not letting you get there.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic public, he added: "I believe that our political class, which is just ahead of Brexit, is leaving the heat behind.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the survivors marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
A small group of activists, following the group's founding this weekend, waved around the Tories Against Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has made the move with the Conservatives due to the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know the IT systems and all the technology for installing Canada plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
The warring parties are planning to become "serious" candidates for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "seriously looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke to Samsden about her future during a rally at the Stadhal in western Massachusetts.
The Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against the GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been the center of speculation that the 2020 anti-Trump campaign has gone unchallenged.
The Samshad Nomads event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in Stadhal format since Trump took office.
One of the participants was asked about plans to become a presidential candidate.
The warren replied that it would be time "for women to go to Washington to flee our futility government, and that also means that a woman must be on top."
There's been a lot of hype surrounding the release of LSU Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the deadly shooting at basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting, and asked for help to identify the man who is seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told Samsden, according to 247sports.
Wayde enlisted to help his colleague and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he had shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a warrant and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6th junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season played 32 games with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton knows the world championship more after the team's success gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It is clear that the Mercedes team line-up will play a major role in the course as Valtteri Bottas qualified for the Samsden ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole the Bottas got a good start and almost took out the Hamilton while defending his position in the first two animals and the Vettel invited his teammates to attack.
Vettel was the first to go to the pits and led Hamilton to drive the traffic to the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes then went on a tour to the pits and was behind the bat as it came out, but the Hamilton went first after a bike-to-bike action, as the Ferrari driver unintentionally had to release the banister and risk still undervalued to defend the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen started in the next row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was then the first for a majority of the course while holding his tyres for a quick finish and for the Kimi Raikkonen to be handed over for fourths.
He was finally on the 44th lap and drove to the pits but he was not able to raise his pace in the last eight animals yet, while the Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me down.
The team thus did an exceptional job for having one of two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally because he insisted that he did not lie to Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly talk about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what the Senate is anticipating shows that people are "bitter and honest and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that was going on during the last few days in the Senate, when one sees the rose, when one sees the roses and the bad and the ugly and the dishonest," he said.
"When someone looks at what is being done publicly and is being lied to and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you played?
Do you remember his answer...did you read the document - 2oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Wait, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein disputed that the leak knew of his office.
"I didn't hide from Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't lie to his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked."
But his resignation did not come well to the president, who commented during the rally a Samsden: "I tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continues to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, which has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, suggests that the Democrats were going to use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They want to restore the power with all the means that are necessary.
You see the wickedness, the honesty, it doesn't matter to them who they are, how they have to overcome in order to gain power and control," reports Mediaite as what the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have been keen for the loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the back match 5-3 in Dundee a draw.
The Giants were earlier ahead with two goals through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance before the Giants were back for good because of the Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard has scored for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Goalers secured the victory.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on a Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the three games before.
The Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while the Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged initial period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants were given a lead in the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to a similar level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he has made sure they win with his team their fifth in the half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match a free kick.
Fuchlots dies to make sure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape from an earthquake.
A pilot in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while trying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people comes safely from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
Strong winds continue to sweep the area and many are trapped in the streets of the city of Palu.
But although his co-workers fled to save her life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the willowing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to safely escape.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
Sea prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to bring it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before reaching the Palu helicopter.
"Our hearts break when we hear that," he said.
Meanwhile, the agencies said the death toll could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to rise, as many bodies still lie under the threshold while others cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves that were up to 6 meters high destroyed Palu, where a sundial is held a mass grave.
The military and the paramilitaries bring help and relief.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance body.
The water is scarce.
The mini-marts are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is making haste to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work for the roof at night to complete your tasks in the context of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people have died.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air Niugini now says one man disappeared after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that conducted a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man has disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was in the process of sinking.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that they have not been able to get up for a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boaters helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane got into the water as it was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agency said it was pleased that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers would still be in the hospital, and that all were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact omission of the faith remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
There were a number of signs that the plane was flying down the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had taken a deep dive.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others have brought it to completion, through the water that has gone up to the hips, up to the safety exits on the plane that was in the process of sinking.
He said he had panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small wound to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who worked closely to improve a shipyard also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to shore before the aircraft and about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water went under.
Data from the flight safety network indicated that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents of PNG-registered airlines, but none of them were in a relationship with Air Niugini.
An analyst retraces the period of the night and expensively a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a Samsden declaration of her case in a second investigation of a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has long been an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retraced for the jury as a cell phone dummy used to join the movement of 29-year-old dressed Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many mobile phone operators who showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the evening of his death, contradicting his statement of one thing, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford issued a summons, claiming that he had not been to the roof of the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he was going to "leave because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he had known the Chambers since about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phones have shown that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers's phone.
"He's gone out of his life," Hale said.
It is planned that the defense of a sonnet will begin to become their last arguments.
The judge said he expects the trial to take place later on the roof of the jury.
The High Breed What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claim that the hip hop of its origins has gone from political messages to solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop love again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been re-populated in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
What's with the blacks?!
A young woman's husband has been arrested for "disgusting" her son's "spoiler"
A New York child molester locked up a group for a discriminatory dismissal after it received a wrongly-addressed text message from its mother, who complained it was "after a black man."
The couple argues that they are racist, and compare the complaints with "expression"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when it was discovered that the new baby care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when it arrived for its first business day in 2016.
"I don't know what to say," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, two times.
After noticing the faux pas, an "unfortunate" Plasco-Flaxman fired Madame Maurice, and explained that the girl had just left, an African-American, had done bad work and that it had instead been expected to be a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Madame Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice closes the couple to get a compensation from the dismissal, and expects a compensation of about $350 per roof for the 6-month job for which it had lived in the house for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, something like that doesn't work," said a Freedom of the Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple had backed down against allegations that they were racist, saying it was the deliberate decision to break Maurice's stance, fearing that they might not be able to trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Do you want your children to be in control of their own lives, even if it's their own fault?
Your new-born baby?
Dajee."
Plasco, while comparing the complaint to "expression," said that his wife only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Is there a way to get a person to run?
This is not a good way to act," the investment banker added.
While the court case was still going on, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, and slammed them for their behavior and their logic.
The Paddington movers feared that the readers might not have had a relationship with a beer talking, a new letter after.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone it celebrates the first time it's read before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's success."
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been rose if his work had not been accepted, and added that the 60th birthday of the books was "battery sweet" after his death.
Regarding the Paddington, who describes it as a "very important family member," it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke up," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like if someone could have achieved that something: it's really proud of them even if it's not their own work.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter and Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital were brought to Nice, where the doctors tried without success to save his life.
"Nad has often called to say that it was going to look very bad, that it was not going to be expected that it would pack," said Madame Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I was called by Nad to say that it was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm on the same side.
I'll go with the mind.
The drugs given to him by the doctors to keep his heart at bay have affected him loudly and loudly and left his system.
He died a short time ago, and that was just the end.
I just sit there and wait, knowing that all of this is going to happen.
I couldn't drink or cry because I was in a situation with families and people.
I'm really going to have to rap together."
Finally, Madame Ednan-Laperouse, who is mourning the loss of her daughter, had to climb the plane with the other passengers – without knowing what they were going through.
"I didn't know anything," she said.
"I put my head down, and the rain fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the curse I felt a huge sympathy for the nade.
He needs my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved it.
Women in mourning send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide have managed to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support, along with a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel the same way about me," he said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a growing grin.
"Everyone knows it because of its color.
"They've always had a sense of humor, no matter where they went."
But, he left his job before one died because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his sibling's part after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that this will have consequences."
Mrs. Davis made the card, "to tell people that there are people out there who can go to the one and talk to the one, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Madame Humphreys, who has been friends with Madame Davies for years, has lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he felt bad or depressed or so," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that someone was acting differently.
He was at the end of the day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye or so."
He said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to be one of them: "It's a laugh going on throughout the whole family.
It's going to make us squirm.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what we asked for - a time-limited survey, with limited scope - then we could maybe achieve a little unity," said Lord Flake, a Samsden, adding that he was "fearing that it was going to happen."
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to report?
Their reluctance has to do with the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, then they will be greatly weakened and their attempt to get the man they want and the highest court in the country elected.
George W. Bush took the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Har Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met through him his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to negotiate a tie and appeal to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'fails' to keep track of Kim's death
The number of survivors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the union ministry in the south and said there were 1,127 survivors last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and large costs of human smuggling played a major role against them.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered a South Korean citizenship, according to the report.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree that they should create a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, has imposed sanctions on the U.S. for failing to make progress on the issue.
"Without trust in the U.S.A., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally for the first time," said Lord Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court in his temperament.
Pelosi gave the comments to Samsden in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, she would be saying 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Dunedin.
Kavanaugh has alleged that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were all two teenagers who were emotionally challenged.
While his earlier statement was highly emotional, Kavanaugh in part shouted or swallowed himself while speaking to his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "gross and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals who were concerned that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's statements proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements in his own way and in the way that he opposed the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi raised concerns as to whether it would try to unseat the Kavanaugh in case an opposition arose, and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only fit to be on the Supreme Court, but also to be on the court where it's right," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered to be a conservative justice.
In his resignation, Kavanaugh is asked about the possibility that he would die against certain Supreme Court decisions that went out of the way.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, partisan person to take to court and then expect us to say 'that's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
The woman has to do it.
It's a righteous rage, months and years of anger that overwhelms, and didn't get it out without crying.
"We're going to cry when we get pink," said Mrs. Steinem, 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leadership force somewhere, where she said she's also going to cry if she gets pink, but that she's developing a technique, which means that if she gets pink and starts crying, then she'll cry to the person she's talking to, because she's going to cry."
I'm going to praise you."
And then she just continued.
I thought it would be brilliant."
Trees are partially allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of a previous job, in a mainly male office, where I was struggling with unspeakable anger, was that an older woman took me by the tail – a cold manager I was always a little afraid of – and threw me into a trap.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is there.
They'll be happy to see you, and they'll be happy to see you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Lord Hard was caught up in an outlandish affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the course, Madame Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that it should no longer be considered the idea for a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the course, and the last thing they needed was another one.
It's called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was already late in the campaign, it was behind with fundraising, so it swore it wouldn't go into the course unless it raised $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
It turned out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, only gave him $250.
"Am I going to get a refund?" he asked.
As it held its word and announced that it would not launch a formal campaign against it, it was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who opposed it, frustration with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and target voters and non-delegates, and anger against sexism – that it has caused it.
"I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said in a statement.
"I've been told that I was a corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I was going to write on my grave.
"Did it crash?"
The U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China have made one pass, and even if the fight is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warnings at the beginning of this year by auctioning a major Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so in the end half of the guides coming from China and the US were taxed.
Beijing has bounced back every time, and has put recent tariffs on five to ten percent on U.S. guides worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to join the U.S.'s shot-for-shot, and the world's second-largest economy won't push in as soon as it does.
If they were to stop Washington from doing so, they would have to face demands, but publicly doing little in front of the U.S. would be too much blame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right decisions, the pressure from the US in the trade war with China could positively support in the long term because it will make the interplay of the two economies less difficult.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic center collapse in the two countries is, in the end, much more dangerous than the spectators have recognized so far," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the New York Times.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it would be ready for the refugees who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists again to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now met so that the refugees who want to return to the country and those who have to flee due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their living situation can return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they did not accept any kind of help or assistance from countries that had sponsored the uprising.
Ryder Cup to be held in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they defeated Team USA with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who has the majority of tournament problems, shot his tea-shot into the water on par-3 of the 16th laugh, and eventually lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all his rounds, and has become one of the 4 players who have each had a 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament received the hot form.
The American Jordan Spieth was voted 5&4 of the worst player on the list of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best-placed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2-1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most victories of all times of the tournament with 25.5 as his career point.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he took me along and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's going to be the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He will be the torchbearer to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated US Legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game A Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A comedic statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled to find fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played the entire tournament across golf at a high level.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
It was a time when we were celebrating Europe.
More have been struggling.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will be regrouping, I will speak with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will continue.
I love the 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Someone has to take his or her toll.
We've been overtaken."
