Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment to the Criminal Code section condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the minister, but MPs rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet final, and the appeals court is required to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The Victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be determined who the winner is.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the election, but now it is a matter of clarifying whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a certain way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women may already be forgetting to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably not suitable, instead, for the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught up in a shootout that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusades"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go in search of investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
The individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the quarter-on-quarter period, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors no longer settle in Italy alone, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.

The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the quarter-on-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>, the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaping up.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.

In Germany, voices are rising saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that you will not miss the European championship event.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured from the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the genius Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so the national football arches will receive a gratification of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams struggled just to maintain the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began praying at noon on Tuesday in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
There is talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze Iran’s nuclear program, Israeli sources say not only the Isfahan nuclear power plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity affects 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It shows again the importance of the environment where it is grown for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children of normal weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten French fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children, there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 elementary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
A proper diet and plenty of family exercise are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” the survey found.
No breakfast but with built-in for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are also important details, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast with the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane French fries are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks on a daily basis (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed play sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your own diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The dietary preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal.”
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and follows closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changes to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of the study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet," the study notes.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet sodas, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for the main meal in the questionnaire and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of show business.
And it'll get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-cut, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not to dress it in a too challenging way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least a piece of extra fabric to measure.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, to whom he must design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the style of fashion that suits the person in question.
It's my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently will have gained a hundred pounds (please note the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from magazines or look for them on the Internet and print them, then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only physically dress, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (on specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us all about it.
But all of this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests cheered the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
The designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
In this case, variability is fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just fold it up and raise your neck to get a totally different picture.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
“Then you can break them,” Jakub said.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he wants to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And also that the photos the clothes works in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone, in many cases, is half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the market have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will tell us a size very different from their real (smaller).
Then it is only left to sift and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has fattened / thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion, but that he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you especially need to communicate with the people you have seen, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and fill it with beautiful clothes, you can’t take and throw away everything that was there and say, ‘Oh, what a horror.’”
“Find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clippings of clothes in front, if it was larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric).
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don't get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a pink road, but it gives me exactly the same thing what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you compete across America.
Reviewing
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper oversights of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, the expectations were met, but this is of no use if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised to give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as shown, it appears as a game that should not end up again being a genre of action without more.
We also felt curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As usually happens in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called mistakes, but rather it is the incomprehensible disdain of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are occasionally diversified by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you must be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normally in a classic race), then you try to save time (timed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the middle of all this sometimes appears the police, who does nothing but make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you might expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not get annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but you can not claim that it is bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But a race designed with enough action is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything is in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games of this type can not be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are scheduled in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or get off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, reset doesn’t help, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find yourself somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It doesn’t matter when you arrive, because it’s programmed because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your noses.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the time, you will always be advanced by the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can spoil the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit is taken the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so that it doesn’t fit the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas supplies next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will be enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is useful for both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
By car you reach the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you can run in the dark on the roads (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, behind you comes the subway convoy and is taken in front of you without more.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "Each of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble asserting that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but get ready because the mistakes will hit you in the eye with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The Ambassador to the EU, Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without a barracks."
“It will be five, six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles,” Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, for it would be the envy of many lecturers of the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also weighed the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism, that if he is an insult, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone bewildered, because he takes on his roles perfectly."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy representative is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" This is an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> has also dealt with the agenda that follows, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good riot", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being treated now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which ones less? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms, or jargons that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
A Europe of speed awaits us.
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the poor support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes to me, a Frenchman at my side says to me, 'What, are you left, those of the Visegrad Group?' and you see that it does him no favors."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>, is waiting for very tough new budgetary policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, should stay away.”
"These procedures will be increasingly and will reinforce a two-speed Europe," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the member states, not just among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to search for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-standing placist character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the slogan that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully built company culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to prospering even further in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, took care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Bata in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded top inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the very beginning, the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, a rain of ideas online, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that ideas abound, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company," says Harvard Business School economics professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Great Green” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies, and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial exchanges, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year IBM has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied customers’ taste and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And this is the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about a fifth are programs and another fifth are equipment.
However, as late as 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of the supplier share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM is acting on the premise of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investments during the great economic crisis of the 29th century.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically up to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
The currency of IBM is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "check clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint enlisted the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to assist him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are built).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company began to expand rapidly across the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chief’s chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pieces", which established the computer standard of the time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer complete advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make more rational use of the technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not improved, for example, in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
As early as 1932, it opened a branch in then-Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> about her unfaithful husband:
Yveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychyt<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But I would live here no longer as my dear and old borriko who was wrong, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far, Josef doesn't care if his wife has locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the house, I do the shopping."
“Darina and I talked normally, the only thing is that we didn’t share a bed,” Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t interest me, neither where she goes nor if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s Worst Vices: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, which cite certain female vices that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trap per week?
Do you like to shop often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But look, what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothes stores, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve told your partner to wait outside the door.
The Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases sound like you?
What is it?
Then she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of complaints, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite stream.
Clean the windows, run the vacuum cleaner, scrub the floor, remove the dust, scrub the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on clean ground with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not occupy to be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make Unpleasant Comments
"Used panties are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the floor!"
If you do these cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get him out of your boxes.
Of course. You don’t mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
slanders and gossips
Some women also suffer from slander, gossip, but also from offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
At best, each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand in the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are women who are uncontrollable, who love to gossip and often do so, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and took it one step further and was declared the match's best player.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jagr's partner, Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game that I would triple it."
"I introduced him."
"Sometimes they look ambushed," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first strike.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek made the record behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically, by Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through Wayne Simmonds' quarter-final goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player on the court, but he’s certainly in the top three,” Jagr told his centre.
“I never would have imagined that at the end of my career I would be playing with an athlete like him.”
“I’m very satisfied with it.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results,” adds J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again Dwyer's penalty to put himself a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorakek described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has put itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We played the game only with a veteran player, the rest were novels."
“Finally, but it’s that there’s nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to further simplify the game, get the record out of our field."
“And so we leave gaps,” explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players that put an end to a series of losses that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five state-authorized travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time in most cases sold trips only to the socialist bloc, as trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDA (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night like that, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for trips to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czech way of travelling has undergone a genuine revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, the fact that until 1989 one could not travel freely to the currently favorite destination, Croatia, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighboring Western European states was imposed, prompting a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not look tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned goods, sausages, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 on a regular basis, to prepare the trips using the connections of charter flights, which made the prices of the trips incredibly low compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, every year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries depart. This winter will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries currently visit them about 100 thousand Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per head on trips abroad, including expenses at the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, which could again end in stalemate.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned his post in June not without first summoning his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hasek era, a dispute arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (N<0xC3><0xA1>rodn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
There was no consensus as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, also supported by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
Even the Executive Committee could no longer shed more light on the situation, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically solved nothing.
The opinion about the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the direction of the association, represents professional football.
According to the proposed model in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees, surprisingly, although the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are supposed to be more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like to have the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so it will cooperate more at will," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope a deal is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team is complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to provide a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen football players, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not be running for such a relevant position.
“If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.”
“But to this day we have not been able to find such a person,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which paves the way for the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say that right now they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that vision,” he adds.
What is supposedly most bothering Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence delegates’ vote in the general assembly.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, he would maintain his current status and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name Pelta was associated with a phone call during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
“And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us,” said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes some caution in his previous statement that he would “sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president.”
In the event of winning Thursday’s election, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k could consider cooperating with Pelta in the future.
In the same view is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation."
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I also don't put my nose where I don't feel able," added Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew much attention to support the suspension of the Referee Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He uses his management skills of private companies, because since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said without hiding his dislike of Spartan president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the lottery’s tax sport.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing.”
“If they were to raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop,” he says.
In addition, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in hypocritically giving up my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then coming back there after a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the stalemate of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitively serve to resolve, in the future, the disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People of all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President on Thursday."
“They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,” says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the readjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win over delegates.
“If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, in theory, he tries not to get involved with his opponents.
In the past, he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with his head.
"It's been more than a year in the world of football, and it's already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains true to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest ones.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"I would have to know the tasks of each employee first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios being predicted before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will definitely get through it.
“Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader,” still two days before the most decisive day in its representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working willingly.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Czech Football Association in the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemians case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by former president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I don't mean that I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competencies so that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step,” he explained the reasons for his indecision.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so as not to give up like that, no more,” he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that he already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose now is over.”
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he announced, worried that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was chosen, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few elected officials."
“I can be reproached for a lot of things, but not for the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football for everyone, because that’s the only way everyone will feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into a Czech part and another Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
“It wouldn’t be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election campaign, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strongly supported by the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner from disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, it acknowledges its share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football," he sees the other rival, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing in the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” he told rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
She lay back on the water, gazed at the artistic dome above, swam towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "constructions of concrete" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine smell, while running fans can breathe in the fascinating smell of fir forests or hear the cheery bird squeaks in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splashing in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically folded: the tall vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrated waters in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline and are located in a Tersz<0xC3><0xBC>r<0xC3><0xB6> building in the shape of a bottle.
Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on Zurich’s rooftop pool, you can look at Arlberb, snow-covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: <0xC3><0x96>tztal’s water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steam rises in winter, while from the bottom the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, did not invade the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas oil plague is so strong that people believe they have arrived at a toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose ligament sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a well-being enjoyment in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit outdoor swimming pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked terrain.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing among the tiles.
The decline was countered by a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural to the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the raw material business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to test the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, to 84 percent of Germans it does not seem acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, betting on commodities was thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from the offers and demands, and make profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism in a different way than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business “deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank’s reputation.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows in an especially drastic way how ruthless banks currently harm the public welfare.”
Ackermann finds himself as the largest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann is dealing with the issue of people going hungry or Deutsche Bank fame.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was unplanned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation you can perfect your image.
And you need to barely care about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent thought it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices would bet.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes out of agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and be transferred to another institute.
The 21st House in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and crumbled.
It now reopens as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate about clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
To this day, the building is considered a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the southern station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "20th house".
The building was adequate but lacked the proper spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is declining more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon, the belvedere museum was inaugurated, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and monument patrons, provided public funds and private patrons.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are on display, there should be a cafeteria and a bookshop and also an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are major problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass roof was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the office of monuments and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
That of the pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why I wanted to “awaken the right conscience.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban stroke of luck. The totally new and planned "central station district", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps there will be another stroke of luck: House 21 could receive a boost from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you can hear, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would avoid train breakdowns in the winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this, it is necessary to achieve better availability of vehicles and of the railway network even with extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from roads and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice shelves for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of the high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of a shaft at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in U.S. fines
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay there a million-dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage bonds.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to make up for the millions of losses it has incurred.
The agreements currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also sued other major banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it led to the demise of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have engaged in countless processes to receive compensation or sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the highest number of lawsuits.
It accuses the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, which is business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IBM’s Information Technology company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed at CNBC that he has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM knew nothing about the compromise so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname “Oracle of Omaha.”
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock market shares rose one percent.
“The blue giant,” as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
After the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau", the Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is reviving.
The murders of eight small-business tricksters and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed to be dead long ago returns, since the M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of far-right violence against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The discovered far-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived again?", headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper “Sabah” points out that one of the perpetrators was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right pandanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcaster "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci’s column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not looked for suspects in the far-right circle much earlier.
Some are less rhetorical when it comes to the drastic media: "From now on, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," writes "Selen".
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has more clearly shown the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the Turkish side’s group sentiment.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then mainly critical of the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen firebombing, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel replaced him at the Cologne funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute with taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Bank of the Lake Zurich Scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves friendly remarks about his future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"Me alegra collaborate con Kaspar Villiger y Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
Weber has been advised to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a counselor, and has had a period of adjustment that is surely necessary.
He suddenly becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, for years, it slides from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared from the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also handy, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, at $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: “Before my students, I have always rated USB as a model of a good bank.”
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it was revealed that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very smart banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To load with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some would look with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque Singaporean state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 at Switzerland’s second highest-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS’s balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic performance (see graph).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in the management of goods through the aid of tax fraud.
And just when it was back to something quieter, just when it was thought that UBS was getting it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case, it is clear that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t master risk controls.”
So the idea arose of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no too great risk, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewellery shops such as Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been living here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "safety".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
“That Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-strong country decided the largest rescue operation in its nation’s history,” writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What do you think?
They talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different precursor banks of the UBS to complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of the administration of goods in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make a step from learning on the bench to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The detainee arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the banks' success.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well for him.
In forex trading and stock trading, it was at its highest.
However, the advisers of the companies in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Thirsty for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks sought the downturn for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than expected.
The seats at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to date.
Currently, a manager of a large bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, in which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, ending investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to slow down a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run UBS’s business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Remove 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that are surely being asked by Axel Weber right now.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome are still without force.
Industrial production on the continent is suffocating hopes of stabilizing a debt-induced crisis at its source.
The general relief on the changes of government in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming back to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

The Nasdaq index of the technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is down 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is placed at the end of its boom.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistical office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We’re not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws a decade of old principles across the board and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it quote against the trend in the market at first just a higher percentage.

Smart graces spread in cities
In many places peacocks are considered “problem birds”: these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the gracios have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the dirt and the noise of the animals accumulate.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
Graeco no longer leaves the cities, experts say at the first symposium on Graeco in Leer, East Friesland.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field from certain protected graze; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The gracias are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass-kill the district graze jumped to negative headlines in the press.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
"By driving them out and driving them away in a normal way, nothing is achieved," said Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver, an urban planner and landscape designer at Leer.
Shooting water into nests or tossing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"Animals are diverted, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
To drive them away is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes, or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible for them to re-settle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a peak in the face with aplomb."
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Graeme Teaching Circuit, where signs inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
In the meantime, the project is accepted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also has his own opinion on criticisms for the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the peacocks not only take advantage of resources to access shady bites, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four grades how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, birds learned quickly that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the shrewd ones had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the beak.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the pull of the tube.
Three of the four grazios got it on the first try.
Portugal in the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the last tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Led by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 away match, made the five Eurocup appearances in a row.
The Czechs won 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back-to-back match with the outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the away match (2-0).
Croatia didn't let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) cut distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 South African World Cup playoffs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started off perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct free from more than 30 meters to get to the top of the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from a distance and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not dress in the first half-hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg team player, leader of the English Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Next, Ergolding’s colleague Wolfgang Stark was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of penati bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark kicked a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with Petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European Champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the Eurocup.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech with a reflex avoided a possible goal in Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the frontal lap, very just at the goal of Cech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's slingshot, the forward of FC Seoul escaped again (50th).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed out on the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his third-round bench seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream-principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made way for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who won 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, was put to the head in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vasilyev (57) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the staunch defense avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, scoring 1-0.

A Hungry Labrador Dog Lights a Furnace, Burning a Home
A hungry dog presumably caused the fire of a house in Brandenburg/Havel.
Probably, the dog jumped over the stove to reach the food, as police reported on Friday.
He moved the regulator and lit a stove.
Papers were placed on the stove.
The fourth-floor home of the neighborhood house began to burn on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died from inhalation of combustion gases.
The fire-causing negligence proceedings against the 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the home during the fire, have continued.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015 they will circulate approximately two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros), the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and hire workers,” said Bill McDermott, co-president, at a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are based in the booming country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume for 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year it entered approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider that employs 50,000 workers worldwide, is going as well as rarely in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“We currently want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate sustainable growth in China through comprehensive instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story about World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an uncommon book, which he correctly describes as “an anti-history work.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.” It’s about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
“The beauty and pain of battle” combines the wartime experiences of more or less 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others go off.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on their beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Katrina hurricane that stinks.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“Failure of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivations and coping with them.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Success us, everywhere substitutes".
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive toward savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbaric taunt behind that."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar “to a condemned being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer with good-made clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innocuous and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and stuff their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness.”
In this translation of the Swedish made by Peter Graves, Mr Englund’s prose, agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects how war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell’s The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like No Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund’s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if I’ve come from her book, torn from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a match.
After a previous false step, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as pepper spray spraying on protesters, could not be repeated, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupiers".
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking toward Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called riot training — counterterrorism measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“To the few cops I know who were called for this, they weren’t told it was to get into Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clear the park, but they gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged ahead of time after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district – dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr Kelly said many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and speakers were gathering at the Pike Slip crossing with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages tumbling from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters just picked up their stuff and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests needed to be made in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was because of his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated harshly by agents.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the park’s western edge, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense web of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags and bags of paper and plastic trash packed with clothes, teams from the Department of Cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were chained to each other by the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “alteration of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esp<0xC3><0xB3>sito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives at the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for dismissals
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, alleging that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the city’s lowest-paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as a political vendetta for their refusal to allow the city’s access to a health care fund in charge of working groups last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a hearing at City Hall last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school's support staff would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically underfunded.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. The 36th district’s budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrolment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a labor exchange, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," the draft complaint says, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Massachusetts Democrat), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "valent"
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's a bipartisan endorsement of their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and never came to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually wipe the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism.”
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as did the June bill?
The latter version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves an entire House or Senate vote in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in bringing their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of the amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can fulfill, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when it comes to proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Blowed but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to death at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television on Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his ABC News appearance "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he unexpectedly returned to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “All right.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special one-hour “20/20” program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program looked at Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only hold one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her up.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head move.
A sneeze of the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
In a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been hit.
And you're going to come out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines burst into their posts around him.
The crowd of etiquette stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as then-President of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were shown as some kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The strikingly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who don’t want to seem ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are held in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with the negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for its alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after entering Lyman’s room, the man approached him from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel look forward to a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread violation among the military, in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going for the army's major plan, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, he will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by active-duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to give them the discharge of service – a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Defense Department’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the attacks are notably under-reported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which figure in about 13.5 percent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial — half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant – from a cut in her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"I was put in the psych ward, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, ""That wasn't his trial. That was my trial."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that liability poses.
And he adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go his way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue up his other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs,” he says.
“Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new far-right face in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a killing in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time prior to his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s hoarding of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then ran ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Upon arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry at immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in “Likes,” messages on walls, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a boom in research, boosting the number of academic jobs with the site’s name on the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook eliminates all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many state updates with their drunks.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “pushing” its own population to get data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in mid-2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information that can be accessed – digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make available to others its large amount of data).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with students’ Facebook public walls.
“As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that some of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperweight and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Knights Templar,” he told a packed room of 500 people.
“I oppose the court, because it has been mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of advancing towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge determined he is not a mentally ill man, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be advised that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically smooth out the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't," a relative of a victim said.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview, Shown in a Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off ahead of a series of special screenings in the biggest markets this week, is how much he understood this creative mind about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a designer, dreamer, and self-recognized hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flowchart junkie — a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringley was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At the time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively at his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs’s death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This archive material, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview, which arrives at Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’s perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward more important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after I explained everything in detail here, it was and it did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done in good faith, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs in detail.
The joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the “Blue Box” he himself built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and you screamed through the public phone and came back a minute later to the public phone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think there would ever have been an Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into shrieks just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode-ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a client if he could assemble the whole team.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalled the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... I was shouted that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, and what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t do that electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain — these concepts — adjust them all at once.
In the end it all comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What made the Macintosh great in part was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, I might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as court accepts case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to carefully study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the full reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to allow the lawsuit to go ahead and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historical allegation is expected by March, and the outcome will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be at its peak by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim the law should be dismissed will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and a staunch opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it’s not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they could be said to fall under the Canon 4C Code, which states: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of various judges that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were paid into a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say too easily mix court activity with agenda-driven groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Attorney General of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the first instance court.
Her critics have pressed Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record $18 Billion Order
Emirates is asking for 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the selling price for all 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft for its dollar value – 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the widebody aircraft market and helps to keep out its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country," Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They took over the polls, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory at Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly outperformed Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who had led the polls before the election.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate for his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently holding the post of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unlucky left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive targeting traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n’s elections may seem, a victory will help propel the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year."
BAsD urges Asia to help rescue euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the euro zone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two largest fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that look at Europe’s difficulties in an “unbiased” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU bailout bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility for helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, in poorly-managed company jobs, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened with “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “risks to the downside” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that upcoming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors, Afghanistan’s battlefields, civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to remove many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target."
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good disposition.”
The cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
“While funding for wartime on the accounts of Overseas Contingency Operations is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be adversely affected by severe disruptions to core budgets,” Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
“The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime suppliers, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would provoke a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are strongly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement late Monday when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result that you can live with, and it certainly is not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to occur.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ recent warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts is yet to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing she was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta enunciates new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delays in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and compromised around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new land-based combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “caught” with an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
Congressman for New York and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his denials quickly refuted by the irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And, again, no one who lives it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are widespread legends about traps in school and university exams.
There have been cases where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes they met.
Detecting lies, or “the location of lies,” is an essential skill that we all must acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been rebuffed.
Liars do look into their eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush, or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than people who are not married (but who tell their lies).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do I know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide reference points for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally knocks with their foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when they see their feet knocking in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper body by trying to remember their story, can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview blur” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely state that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot down and used the time he spent claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a differentiating language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... to what I know... to my understanding."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted after the threat of the U.S. delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions as it appeased environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supply.
“This is a real road to progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking and irrigation water.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if TransCanada’s hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to throw up in fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The diatribe of the "Lady Marmalade" singer frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when trampoline Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to get her,” he said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman in anger.
“He said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He got angry and started using bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle at me.”
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’” the girl’s mother said.
LaBelle jumped on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled back to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get an answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer support association.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate change has crippled the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez’s management, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and contracted the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-described as the change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead if there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity overall of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report on frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused to 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables and corn.
The first fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment continued to increase in the first three quarters of the year, since from January to March 55,053 Sinaloas were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent active.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, since for people who illegally grab dollars it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloa labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
Along with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI amounted to 630,697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent from the previous year's 5 million 143,312 registered dollars.
For its part, the State Government’s Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17.28 billion pesos in the year, mainly from tertiary sector companies.
The Debt
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos, and no sector has been observed until November.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ first year of government shows a lack of capacity for government management.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 it lacked the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground that we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have failed to align the effort of everyone and above all the good already synchronized progress of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic Slowness
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefine Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patron Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he said that it is necessary to lead the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and the economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated,” he said.
Work to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the efforts of the Government.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the government has been striving to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was convicted of eight pounds of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days of fine, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted drug trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army elements on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was riding in a pick-up truck, white, carrying a black bag in the vehicle’s box and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person continues to be interned at the Enforcement Centre for the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Contributions due to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The director of municipal social development said that although the work programmes have so far advanced, they are at risk for not having fulfilled the State Government with the corresponding contributions, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the state accounts for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these becomes effective.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous sixties because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven’t given us a fifth.”
"Analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies raised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, not meeting the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and in admitting the demands, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I don't think that if I did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectorship of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he said, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorship of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data cast by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6, thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of this year's electoral process in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data cast by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the total votes corresponding to 874 votes of 879 ac.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be remembered, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not homologate his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Law of Electoral Justice, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omits its publication with the arguments provided for in the Law.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the state president’s vote on constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” since he has no right to “sanction or veto them”.
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the cases that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not operate in the power of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all election boxes may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the election in question and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the candidate representative of the party and/or candidate.
The total count of the vote may also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was seconded, in which case the electoral packages that have been objected will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 percent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday evening, during Monday, recognitions and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute to the side of the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony at the Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the veiling chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was granted recognition at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues from the technological high school and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his high school preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and to have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always expressed it in this way to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and on the lookout for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even dizzying in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
They give you the last goodbye
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés, was fired with honors, in honor of the Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, who gave him the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force and direct students.

Three Abandoned Bodies Found at Cadereyta Estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The find happened on the 1.5 kilometer of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed through the place noticed that on the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, there was the gate open from pair to pair.
Looking inwards, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow beach dress with dark denim pants, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strappy beach dress.
Less than a meter away was the body of another individual with red beach and blue denim pants.
All three were face down.
According to the data obtained at the site, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth can be seen legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured at 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of the National Defense made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "falconry" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first fact on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros were arrested eight people and managed to rescue one who remained deprived of his freedom.
They were secured with three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
By dialing them up and carrying out the inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m. one of his accomplices in the ejido La Frauda was arrested, who, upon seeing the military tried to flee.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone in jeopardy.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The “framework is now well-delineated,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy grapples with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to rush ahead, market instability put the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to bail out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were considerably boosted by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are destined to have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the election is over.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist it should only be made up of technicians, a sign of his regret over a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of Spain’s 22 named footballers, ten out of 50 are internationals.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 summoned reached the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, account for an extensive record of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure reached her on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
The above is added to the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated Euro and World Cup qualifiers.
Tic players, on the other hand, have a limited international reach in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is from the archer <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, head coach of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the ram of the Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic side, and close to Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are the left-hand side J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and the artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outperformed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't come close to 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar owns only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most numbers with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was confirmed by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of their two-decade work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I wonder because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity in the previous days.
What do they say to their most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, then we don’t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a big rock band and have been doing it for more than 20 years since it seemed like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love making music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a band from a city arises, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what brought it, without getting bogged down by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not being a fashion anymore?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of those that came out at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori to be re-interned for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for muscle strength loss in his legs, his chief physician said.
Fujimori, 72, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000), suffers from a number of ailments, including a cancer of the tongue that has been operated on four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated on four times cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which have been joined other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the pancreas cyst, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Police Special Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican partner, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be “propitious for the exchange of information in all political matters between the two nations,” according to the South American country’s presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay’s rejection and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group made up of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the implementation of tax-exchange agreements in order to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigoted plumber passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had she done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" she will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, has been designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", since so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once passed, the most experts will be able to take a "second turn" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous installments, consisting in the fact that the mustache plumber will have to travel through mined platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision follows the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term he "did not get his hands on" court rulings and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is an executive process after all the judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former candidate between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to the rulings of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the $120 million embezzlement in the Defense Ministry when he was president, which was the process leading up to the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of uneducated boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
To this is added the hundred-year-long of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of graduation or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of managers of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the outgoing Mayor and current Ecosocialist Councillor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0> attended the event.
Also attended in the large room of the Fabra i Coats the current councilor of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an occupied farm where macrofiestas were made
The invaders had taken possession of 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro fiestas that were desperate in the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from being repeated.
"From now on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building – the rest are inhabited – took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the setting for the massive parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco notes that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, since they sold the cups for three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints for noise, while, according to him, the inconveniences are not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors.
The head of the disco explained that the inconveniences were so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the occupied building, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even thefts have occurred.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incisiveness that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police reached 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
The park or the mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some banners promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that do not orient themselves in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park lends itself to this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boar in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city called a megacompetition composed of 16 contests for so many other doors of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question comes up: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both because of its purely organizational aspect and because of what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring theme to get your hands on when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the opinion of three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB3>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It has to be based on the fact that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, says the architect for whom the title of "Doors of Collserola" includes a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of some areas where one must act".
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertain that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that he had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is fixing the next step," that is, its overshoot.
“We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.”
More attached to the question, M<0xC3><0xB3>dol believes that, simplifying, the Vallesana side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", by a merely topographical question.
M<0xC3><0xB3>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity offered by the city council to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" whether it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all right", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global vision of Collserola is missing: "16 cross-competitions have been convened -says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the next door architect.
In his view, yes, the City Council should ensure that the immediate upper edge of the Round of Dalt should provide, to its full extent, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal guardian of the Casino Red granted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey the pardon of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal guardian of the Casino Red granted him the pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Panist mayor and on September 2 was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
There he remained for the next 49 days after a second injunction was issued after the Public Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta penitentiary allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he only remained for a few hours in the medium-security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was handed an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that almost two months of investigations had proven sufficient evidence to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on file 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is granted a legal pardon and no claim can be made in connection with the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to be compensated for any damage or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the betting house, around 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally forgiven and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results cast on the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the research done in the impact area does not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
“In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to carry passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on an uphill soft terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
Weather conditions:
The reports at the AICM located conditions suitable for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of low-altitude cloudiness.
Selected routes:
Due to cloud conditions, the crew is likely to have sought a zone of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of debris dispersion of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence remains of any kind of explosion or fire in the wreckage.
The latest research results indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, pieces of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it is expected to be disarticulated along such a path.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned-off site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Leads Social Security research to discover obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Center XXI Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population, whether or not entitled, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico Oriente).
Once the goal of gathering 500 or 600 children is met, the study will continue in the Independent Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics are applied to all participants (genes associated with childhood obesity are sought to be identified).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic rise,” said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (cooks, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were attended to, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of a pavement could be eliminated by appropriate means.
At his conference A technological opinion of the bumps, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
The above means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is being modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
By passing the vehicles and generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, it abounded, a last layer called rolling folder is placed, which is made of a material of fine stone, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the way.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the right thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil is moistened, the water diffuses into the interior of the folder and it is difficult for it to come out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be attended to at first signs with proper maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicular load and ensure that it is complied with, to prevent the formation of bumps frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair the bumps easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of Princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Miss Atlantico stood with the crown and the scepter, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xAD>a, Gial<0xC3><0xA1>ra, Giala, Gial<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>, Gial<0xC3><0xA1>, Gial, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Giala, Gi
Today the big question that many are asking themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Literary Reel Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
“Crime and Punishment is a universal book of literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.”
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizing" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books that quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to pass.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotan journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore did not shine on the stage".
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that it lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “Como en casa” program, said Melina’s appointment as a princess “proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain a queen.”
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very evasive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of his defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen’s trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, “but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered points on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos, believes that the error of the Vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“Surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
His body was never his forte and here it was charged.”
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel vaticinio appeared that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions for the designation of the National Contest itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodging her crown.
This was the work of the cale<0xC3><0xB1>o that identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a Lofoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the collation of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI sectional, that week Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial research for 21 years, was on the “availability” shift.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> municipalities, where he often had to spend more than five days in the jungle to get to the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear minimum clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went out for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactylary card of Guillermo Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, that he was the head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typewriter of the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the Lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When caught, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts,” he said.
Traces can also rule out or reassert suspects in murder cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime, and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the ITC expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective collation is performed.
“Indignants” defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby wig.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the “indignant” to recamp on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the “indignant” response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to remain camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned compound - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," Bray said, denouncing that some officers tipped the protesters off.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with shops or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install themselves with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the early morning eviction from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people,” as “some businesses had received threats” and neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that in the background Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers," the spokesman for the movement added, accusing the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two-month-long protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas TV special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", a bunny from "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the TV show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a crib a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "whore" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also represents the fastest pace of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use the shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the murky US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, spent their weak results between July and September on the yen.
As markets continue their siege of the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is not lowering the guard.
“We need to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed stronger signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 on August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, as it plunged eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again feeds the doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketed and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the labyrinth leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed on his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the 19th pre-election term.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear the doubts about his position: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have committed to nothing else.”
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still reeling from the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay for the sixth instalment" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date either.
The greek lace still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that it lies in being an instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being.
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "most especially, in the one that has the goal of "lowering poverty to half the volume of people living in it".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to every corner of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and above all for the most important women."
There are “many achievements” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push “two basic goals”.
His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of those homes will fall out of the poverty line they are in.
The impulse in the conception of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a emphasizes as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about his lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez said microcredit is “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors in solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without much difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open the way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble's idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country’s weight of the European Central Bank’s directive according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany’s weight.
Anxious to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is also not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for the past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government launched an offensive against the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and give a speech on the topic, already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on the casualties due to illness.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of shortage on private sector workers before they can take the cut.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of absence without remuneration in the event of a job loss (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority again puts on the table the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of labor shortages.
"The controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is found to be committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand told the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of job loss fraud.
In fact, this issue has been under constant monitoring since 2002 and various policy offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French do not get sick any more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully, first, at the national figures.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for the cuts accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accident losses, while 54% is related to sickness losses, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
Therefore, 2.5% of the cost of health care.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that certainly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day off from work due to illness.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% lasted between 8 and 14 days, 15% lasted between 15 days and one month, 15% lasted between one and three months and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of the drops of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, having as its starting point a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure in comparison, for example, with work in black.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies for cuts and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos declared to Parliament on Monday 14 November; he also added that the one hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve such a goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "the country's stay in the euro zone is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Committee Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Should Be Legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society continues to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which had the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted when the patient raises the option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that did not coincide with the position of the federal government, which had already stated that it did not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who have not been or have not consented to it.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal.”
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia.
Eighty-five percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia, saying it would allow people whose death is imminent to ease their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
As for the people who have committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that a trial against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as indicated by the authors of the report.
In addition, their recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code states that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life care without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts have reservations.
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the position of the experts who sign the report “extreme”, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to patients in the terminal phase.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appear to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
“In society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, calling it a "manifesto in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, have spoken out in favour of President Assad’s withdrawal from power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and regime forces has already died.
“If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has lamented that Turkey’s mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have ended in failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tougher stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has celebrated that the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime has been "reinforced".
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone” regarding repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died “during heavy machine gun bombings and shootings in Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not falter,” he added, assuring that “conspiracy against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also voiced support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he said was paranoid.
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the exit plan adopted on 2 November, which envisages, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities held by the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti has spoken of a broad programme with numerous sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting with the President-designate of the Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he hopes that Mario Monti will request before Friday a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that he is “certain that the markets will have patience and will understand it.”
His appointment by the President initially received the approval of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government will run until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence vote of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for new austerity measures to be taken.
Italy’s “boss chief” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him killed, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “since a country that doesn’t grow can’t meet the deficit requirements.”
Monti, famous for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some 200 billion euros in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its “serious concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a nuclear detonation system “with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a member state to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country.”
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4% in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and crimes against religion.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"Following a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have once again increased," Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant."
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, an organization official.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses,” he adds, considering that such efforts could include improving police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to more legibly and lively follow the activity of other "Twittos", that is, of those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rank as a favorite any message, etc.
Twitter’s new formula was tested “with a small percentage of users in August” before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to resend a message from another persona, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users have discussed at the stroke of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” @jemb123 writes.
“The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social-Democratic/Democratic coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign rating of Austria by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Vice-Chancellor of Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request of the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic highs that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by the purchases of investors who consider it a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar re-quoted on Tuesday to less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the exports of the archipelago, since it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the yen's price tag would cut off the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “economic bases.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “adequate measures,” hinting that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Notes by five trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), bringing the threshold of funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion).
Euro area:
Guys grow, bags flake
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area stability, European stock markets are sinking a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions regarding the lending yields of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a narrow range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option of a troubled country leaving the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types far exceed 6%
The credit rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the southern countries, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on October 27 would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for the euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a figure more favorable than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has downgraded the second-quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecast for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean doubling electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its case to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor for Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
Consider the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind sector, of which it gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe’s cheapest electricity.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would reduce realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not in principle express opposition to this type of energy, according to surveys.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it spans a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and that can create non-replaceable jobs.
Should France decide to abandon nuclear energy, it would entail the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is planned?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for either people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between the security authorities, and French and German operators and constructors, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While studied by all the electric actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the partisan emotions, dogmas and maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France “does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters”.
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is limited to including banalities, indicating that the development of the code will solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove to be electorally profitable, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent paper summarizing the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migrant flows on economic growth, as well as on the positive impact of wage and salary flows in countries.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pressuring them to reduce their wages.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly practise professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows implies a rise in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
Such teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious, but also fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little, that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
It is necessary to reflect on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take a blow, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bends to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from its helplessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would take us to a new deadlock.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
Only by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European people's sovereignty, can it be achieved.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "non-contact" chip are generalized
The global chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows you to pay for shared transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to rise in 2012 (estimated at 580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
However, in order to get the upper hand, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks try to pay by mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is essential for making transactions.
“They’re praying.”
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect, which have long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty.”
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped at a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
The axis of terrorism
The study of the calls made indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we should certainly expect to have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
“But it is possible.”
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an uninteresting community of enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), prompts the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations were multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and registered 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has become radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, it claimed one attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A crisis-weakened America, can it manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican candidates for president, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making increasingly loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy issues, traditionally a strength of Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Grand Old Party nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for manipulating their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “appalls” emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows for his part a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capability,” seemingly ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population rather positively judges Obama’s national security record, which ended with bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, every year 27.5 million cubic meters of additional Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe through a first had of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 that will supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube for the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land flow by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has, in just five years, succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," Fillon said during the pipeline's inauguration, demonstrating to what extent major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted in its full length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project gave up on it, seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to be permanently established at sea off its coast.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have planned joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, carried out by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates through the interior of the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to the company for a period of 25 years.
“Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the outlet of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its rectangular black pastes, its rubber, its leaves of broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a design notebook, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has been far behind.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its beginnings, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city center, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Disheartening?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the past 15 years is considerable.
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
It is worth noting that the disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," notes Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mentality of people advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité noted that the surveyed directors have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with "an excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“We have now reached around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased the contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies that have between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly game.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to move forward," replied Lille's forward.
As for the contrast between his performances on his team and in the selection, "it's a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the “pleasure.”
He has been cheering the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
“We just faced it recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has referred to "pride" for his part.
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"Pride" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to be a very high-level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done a great job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"They'll be able to see him in the next games." Including the game against France.
Portugal has a lot of confidence
Portugal’s Paulo Bento is facing the return match against Bosnia with great optimism (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the away game, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There’s no doubt about it; the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, who has been leading since September 2010, is going to qualify for the 2012 Euro.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Taking into account the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t scored away from home.”
But at home, in the bright Lisbon Stadium of Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the party "is very equal," said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
“We expect the match to be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home," Bento laments.
“We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
A good idea, as long as it's realistic this time.
