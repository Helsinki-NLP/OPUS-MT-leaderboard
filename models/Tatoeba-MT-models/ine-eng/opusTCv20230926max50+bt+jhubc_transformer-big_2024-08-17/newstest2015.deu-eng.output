Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speeding motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing it leaving a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before heading off into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police have accused a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The indictment states that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the hearing at the Edinburgh Supreme Court on 17 November.
Rethinking the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
“Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal options when it comes to discriminating against trade unions as other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-trade union forces.
Complementing the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice – and to receive compensation or fines – is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the unions have faced in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labor rights.
There was a time millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of the workers to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to protect trade unions."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
In fact, after these rights have been violated in America, it is very wise to look at the American ideal again, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - has long been overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, enacted by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June and expected to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is set up for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying doctors are thus taking more time to gain hospitalization rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana are missing out on a shady law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to uphold the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for access rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points in a Texas law that would have forced most of the state's remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that doctors’ rights of admission require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient insemination rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient access rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New drugs could slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, as well as social and economic status also affected survival chances.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to address the distances somewhat, she suggested strengthening the service of in-flight doctors as a possible remedy to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographic status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer-funded study is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling number of homeowners
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “Garden Products Kernal Group,” according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with home ownership spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are further factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put on sale annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station shut down its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away from them, they delivered themselves with sticks and stones equipped with clashes with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The army of the country, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "to waste no time and apply no violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already cleaned more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary election.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to storm Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat over spying report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has appointed the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats for a report on U.S. and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister B<0xC3><0xBC>lent said the U.S. Embassy businessperson and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a main area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence agency, Ankara, caused much more outrage from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The train drivers’ nationwide warning strike on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The delay announced for 6 to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-rail transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district president of the German Locomotive Guide (GDL) union, Sven Schmitte, in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
We are expecting significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it will do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bartenders in the infamous Binge-drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are interrogated together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners stated that the authorities’ cousin economy had a serious impact on their businesses.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Let's get our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a scavenger hunt.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the misbehavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants on the infamous alcohol-drinking pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the club tour organiser Carnage had to pay a combined penalty of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balcony", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The FR<0xC3><0x9C>HLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy rains and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a gust that began shortly before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The buoyant weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a gust of wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at about 20:40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide on Tuesday a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted, with possible showers.
Matthies says: It’s high time to network
In the face of galloping technical progress, which threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchboards, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I’m writing this, my eyes fall on the coiled cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I’m like, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, in a very short time all the listeners would fly around the house, and that would be even more retro.
What is the meaning of Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic)?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you just say that you basically refuse television.
Why these reflections?
Because the insistence of Ifa on the radio tower this week brings us back to our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who once mastered the washing machine and CD player blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread before him with inconceivably ephemeral expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quarks?
In fact, for about 20 years now, it has been mainly about the fact that we are supposed to network our house.
So that the yoghurt re-orders itself, so that the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives informs us that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we went from the office to the air conditioning on our soon arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, you say out loud "suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner goes off.
It's wrong.
Everything runs on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred", runs an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicates how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but which is useless in the stau.
We also know from daily practice that if a new-fashion device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters, while rocket and mortar fire on their communities descended during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed while the territory was being cordoned off.
The school launch brought a sense of joy and anticipation to the communities in southern Israel marked by rocket launch holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenades from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza into safer areas and escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on Tuesday to an indefinite cease-fire.
The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’s demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s airports and seaports.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of the dead are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl has declared for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not in front of the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed at the five-percent hurdle in Sunday’s vote.
A first call for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neul<0xC3><0xA4>nderplatz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg bursts from all seams.
Now the interior authorities have set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were informed only a short time ago - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to raise citizens' reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to contribute constructively to the humane housing of refugees," said Britta Herrmann, Green Party leader in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is demanding that the Harburg district administration provide unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough space in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
Tim Lawless, research director at RP Data, said that Sydney and Melbourne operate a two-tiered market.
Figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen only 1.4 percent year-on-year.
Mr Lawless said that with the start of spring, there would be an increase in properties for sale in the coming months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"Considering the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a Feldherr".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
Thus, the Medau family has already been informed orally about the initiation of the university in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were announced only in July is definitely wrong,” said P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "prepositions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not talk of a nine-meter-wide street.
It is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,” explains P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl does not want to let apply.
It is not parked at all because, as with other public parking lots, this can now be solved intelligently.
Think of the locals
The children's crib Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of whose front door the access to the park deck would lead along, should "not be affected", according to the president of the university.
Rather, he adds, "it is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Steib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e and the 800 students of the neighboring Realschule.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," said P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parent Advisory Board of the Kinderkrippe, with the expansion of the street would be entitled to a "lost of the few natural spots of Coburg", "the reader can decide for himself".
In early October, P<0xC3><0xB6>tzl, together with the State Building Agency Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access for the new park deck should not lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Steib-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e as before, but over the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes over a length of about one kilometer.
According to calculations of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
We are talking about 2000 vehicles per day.
So far, the city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf retires from Handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga player SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany, he retired internationally.
Because the heavyweight backroom player wants to go on goal hunting for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much as they will inspire my long-time co-players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which does not allow the current double strain.
The left-hander had to fear his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass without a trace.
I have some health facilities that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
There are a number of other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that while I control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time.
For a comeback he would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all the lines are torn, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world have slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone animated the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade was also slowing down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013 results for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the "M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour through M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland.
Written out in various trade journals, this tour was offered to those interested.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would like to get to know the M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland in this way as well," the cyclists enjoyed the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the association home of the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was scheduled for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz via Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were eaten on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and the mayor’s representative Heinz L<0xC3><0xB6>lfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents", Heinz L<0xC3><0xB6>lfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to M<0xC3><0xBC>nsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Constantin Waker's unsparing honest memoirs
It’s actually more of a philosophical testimony than a biography, which Konstantin Waker, singer-songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, put on paper in “Monch and Warrior” on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought-fetters for thought-fetters, the Munich born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes on abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Waker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out everything unnecessary".
But among all the high-spirited views there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about beatings in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, where he targeted a tree in front of him.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended “many” therapies after his mother’s death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton – who were grown up when I was a kid – went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father’s time, he gained insight into what life would have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep, stygic maze with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry by himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love testimony of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
It wasn’t until my mother’s death that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you ever stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started working in a factory when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was for quite a long time the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "longtime award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking your time or stepping a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't do it wrong if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you’ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head in the right place.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
“A little voice told me, ‘You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they’re repairing the computer.’
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it’s like a great shield of the gods telling me, “This is your destiny.”
He says this, of course, with a DONNERD voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is riddled with humorous outbursts as he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're driving against a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo if I feel like it, but overall I don’t have as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give that up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party Ansar Allah said.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reported a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the paper, threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and calling for the government’s resignation.
The Huthi people have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on Sanaa’s major access roads.
In the countryside, there are bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain 'ghost employees'
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all state officials to remove “ghost employees” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost on payments for “spirit employees” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data is recorded via biometric registrations, a government statement said.
Anyone who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the pay list, the statement continued.
"This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'spirit employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal over the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be discussed in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in bankruptcy.
A spokeswoman for the court said on Monday.
In the complaint, it is stated that Achenbach cheated when purchasing works of art and vintage cars and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of which were school principals.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see people in the student.
The snow cap is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordb<0xC3><0xB6>hmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
Thus, the judge went to the Upper Franconian village of Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the nearest station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go to school there three kilometers across the city and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was put to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first state examination and in 1954, after three years, he applied for the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teacher position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, in the newly built teacher's house next to the school, he purchased a three-room service apartment.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year, these were combined in Petershausen in today’s City Hall.
When the Indersdorf school association was founded, only the primary school remained in the town.
To avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to obtain today's building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig G<0xC3><0xB6>tz, who had a workshop built at the expense of the municipality and basements built during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"B<0xC3><0xBC>rgermeister G<0xC3><0xB6>tz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who had responded to a speech by a school board on law and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to find out, "That's not always possible." Whether he means only his students or his own six children, it's not entirely clear.
In any case, Judges' actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, they did not get any criminal work from him, nor were they silenced to sit back.
At the expense of the community, Judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a match.
For the benefit of the school, the judge as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig G<0xC3><0xB6>tz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the judge without a party to at least be the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Judge was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of people who stopped was impressive: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour, including the accompanying trampoline, enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Biking and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen’s own business, Petra Schwing-D<0xC3><0xB6>ring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of the body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, meringue, streusel and cheesecakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the drinks stand of the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>-Nidda gym.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and garnered enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has re-attached already-jumped bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the head of the company still had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking hall by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as tour leader, could only briefly spruce up, he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-man motorcycle staff of the Hessen police using three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Hello!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and, of course, you had prepared delicacies, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Ho<0xC3><0x9F>feld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his capacity as a member of the ADAC Hesse-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen board.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move freely in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporty action on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens were increasingly mixed up, who were as fond of the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, W<0xC3><0xA4>chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies report.
The police did not make an immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested for allegedly forming an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) described her actions as part of activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla G<0xC3><0xBC>llen against him and other individuals in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Jazenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She comes in with a proud reputation from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
He has his own front experience.
She began her career with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as chairman of the board of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson’s parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance was reportedly nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Already in May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unease when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly that demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming president would run the risk of running for office, beating up everything and tearing apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking on his own job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC downsized – power, money and status overtaken.
As competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world’s certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, each of which costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she's found him.
Perry from Texas says downgrading tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry's user account, which rejects the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I didn’t buy the tweet and deleted it,” the tweet read.
Perry’s staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial promotion from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who may be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet read, “I don’t always drive drunk with triple the permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I’ll complain to Governor Perry if he extorts it.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the Grand Jury's investigation into Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special counsel from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His high-ranking team of attorneys applied to the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charge, arguing that the law that is enacted against the oldest serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funding to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-wing Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa Assembly during his 2012 presidential run, Perry agreed to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London’s most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in South East England has “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought after and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to raise mortgage limits in June due to widespread fear of a loan bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak" and added that this offers a "stable operating environment".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the Cadastre, prices in the city area alone jumped by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average sales prices at Berkeley’s private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound in recent months has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible “villa tax” ahead of the general election next May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tougher lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage lending in July, which also suggests the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in London real estate prices for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has declined by a quarter year-on-year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital city is a boon for Berkeley, as the due amounts for future sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, futures sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April – almost a third more than at its peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax income rose by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, and sales by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations this year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real and accused the hacker of "ecstatic violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will prosecute all those who repost the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Buette Olsen.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World,” also condemned the hack on Twitter.
“To those of you who look at the photos my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are so happy with yourselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disagreed, however, that the photos were about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAVORITE, folks.
Let’s get started. *wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They crumbled, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that you have left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew scratch brushing.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this sluggishness was an affair just beginning, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, who considered beetles to be her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but heavenly valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in the baths, naked snails had left their marks on all the windows and believed they belonged to all this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge heads of cabbage.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting hand-in-hand with Ailinn on the broken deckchairs in the high grass, having enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and had been enjoying an unusually warm black afternoon, both of them huddled absent-mindedly in the service console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of their breezy home rang upon him.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolescent, just like the word obsolescent.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have succeeded, and as the people at books choose the From-Washer-to-Millionaire memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels, so they chose the ballads at music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn’s big feet in a groovy comic Serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game back then, and it wasn’t very funny now either.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
I had to figure out what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or coercion.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group endowment – gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as if by nature, and were tasked with ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WAS HAPPENED WAS HAPPENED--Fearing to be accused of shooting, even fearing that the flames would devour them next--had been consumed by Labneh--and Shifeh--and had been beheaded.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just spoken to her could ever be uttered.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s view.
There was nothing to see all over the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that still doesn't explain why you're giving it to me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“Your thick ankles are exactly the reason I like you,” he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got up from her recliner, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
He was drunk, so drinking was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm-weeds in a storm.
“And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely attracted to you,” she said.
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same bewildered men, with even thicker skins and more saddening according to THE WORDS than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't pay attention!
They first knuckle - knuckle was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - they first knuckle and then beat.
In Kevern’s opinion, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the knuts themselves were already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got up from his chair like an old man.
She also felt bloated, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he walked away, as if from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him, a man complaining about something he himself had complained about.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit – why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher who was invested with energy on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, did not expect to be given a short lecture on the continued violence at low and middle levels in the provinces, or to be invested in the provinces.
“A lot has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been seen among the towering henchmen.
But some qualities turn out to be inescapable.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps at the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicates itself with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former roughness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and struggling workplace.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to overdo it," her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz at last, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call “reckless” and “raw” could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue to walk around on what is happening, if it is happening, as if, if it had happened, it happened yesterday, it means taking its essential life force from the land.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country over the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of it," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only led to WHAT IS WHAT IS WHEN IT IS WHAT IS.
This time, however, it is not the others that we let go of our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
This is a sign of angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you talk about how they would have left out their “anger” and their “trust” in “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that we’re talking about “us” and “others” when we understand the past as well as protecting the present.
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From whom, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything about that - we agree.
And just as no blame must be assigned, no blame must be absolved if such an absolution were appropriate and if there was a way to absolve it.
But what good is the past if we don't learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget it.
If there's anything I can say...
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramids.
"I will consider her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as described by passers-by, had been walking in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho argued that they planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government, saying they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country’s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after he reported threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup d'état, but that the military was responding to the threat from "political fanatics" whose weapons were being armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Lesotho Defense Forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had given the impression of a coup.
“Although no one has claimed to have snatched the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho’s military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, tensions have been high since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disputes in his unitary government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite allegations that were otherwise true.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro zone as well as for the looming deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details over the course of this week as to whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent to manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as does Italy’s decline from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are also not reassuring," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline of industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August manufacturing industry's Purchasing Manager Index in the Eurozone is that the sector continues to grow thereafter."
He added: “Producers in the euro area are finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was “increasingly likely” that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some sort of QE, “although we suspect this will be limited.”
Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom during the horror.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school that killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom during the horror.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now visiting Ukraine - and in the children like them die - will now come to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the torn-down school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried to climb back into the torn school gym after a mine exploded in her underwear.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were full of blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have surgery again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says combatively.
"This has happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remind myself of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help make sure that something like this doesn’t happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail thought his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, “Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying little child on the way, grabbed her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who held his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had been tripped out and with leg injuries in the hospital, for her part, in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now-disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is getting blaring in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids that I played with in the yard and that didn’t make it outside.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borshch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot her with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten better in 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just kids like ours.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past horrors.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes laying on the couch, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
"I remember yelling at him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgiy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgiy today
His bloodied face was scarred as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only George was able to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s long ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the bookshelf at our home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People study such tragedies over and over again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing to such pain.
It takes a few years to forget it a little.
It has affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friend.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn’t allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Though He Was Caught at the Feet of a Murderous Terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It’s still with me, it’s nothing I’ve left behind.
I’m older now and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say, that’s not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the Institute of Veterinary Medicine.
I've been there two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my kids about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this and they should of course not suffer from it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It has to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but not do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increased my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart leapt when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If we could just grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so grippingly carried safely by a special deployment command
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty held back their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona’s mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of crossing girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of assaulting a girl on the crossing at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment alleges that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denies the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the process for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to shoot.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse our Shopping Guide and Reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to watch this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you’ll need to get closer to your objects if they’re to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors’ diagnoses and illnesses are important, while those treated are predominately concerned with something else entirely: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel like it,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time picking myself up.
While struggling with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was making impatient accusations against his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it right away than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and unsettled.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, that is, the skin that overwhelms the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibrous material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, it hardly seems to be of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, there are twice as many people dying from this disease as from road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the stores we shop in.
And therefore, Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no refuge.
The parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, have already been designated as the starting point for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was trained for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the past five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of that year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still get sick?"
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to subside, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most of them have no idea that they are going to die that way.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which those concerned often turn for damages claims, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted to gently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still seen by the EU and the WHO as a "major health risk" with a possible death toll.
However, more dangerous are the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crokydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure to work or home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts, he said, are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster received a "clean health certificate" from the West, it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work must be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, it would be well-to-do.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 and had an operation late at night.
All of a sudden I was shaking.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleura catheters to remove fluid from his lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbott’s practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib cage and the chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
To be honest, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
All of a sudden, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (like Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
He is still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos is now frequently addressed in schools.
And meanwhile, innocent objects in our homes, such as floorboards or shed roofs, have been found to contain asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in much of our real estate,” notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden sheds.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't be seeing another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
“It was very difficult to record all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
It was then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-maintenance mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is whirled up and the fibers inhaled, they can attach to the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they’re pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, highly controversial.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies it.
“You can’t cut out the chest,” he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't appeal very well to chemotherapy," which "shows action," but doesn't heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for those affected.
"Hello, cancer center," he introduced himself cheerfully on calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage that I didn’t have to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial worry – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It’s been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually added to their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, it’s a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation to associate the deadly asbestos contact of a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to file for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 to be able to prove contact but not sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is an insurers’ deal for insurers,” he says, indicating that this amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn’t gone by and mesothelioma sufferers found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labor and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, given seven fatalities, swift action was needed daily.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect, in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“That’s the most important thing,” Abbott said.
This is seen again and again in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you’ll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Once again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think of practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn’t grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, despite increasing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to do so within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
“It’s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s chairwoman.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too “chaotic”.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow residents to elect a government chairman from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in the hands of a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers announced that the movement "has considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that is only to take place when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and tougher security measures including police forces and barricades were in place in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech are starting to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as endangering Hong Kong’s business operations – the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could do great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will spiral out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists staged an unofficial referendum on the right to vote in which 780,000 people took part – more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to universities where freshmen performances are offered by private jet.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cuddle their belongings in a dangerously overcrowded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said that no new bookings have been made as the service has just been introduced, but added that "students will book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also said that despite tuition fees of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year, it expects a market for this offering.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as suspended.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for Higher Education said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting this month are facing a crisis of living costs as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships doesn’t keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest basics of living before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticise racial issues and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest rose and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women were 100% about race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts on Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find in feminism many people talking about being white and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered “women’s issues” in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came to the point where white women campaigners like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group each: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women’s suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes powerfully aware of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn’t do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists were playing catch-up with the issues black women have been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to birth control?” asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who have built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now trying to understand what that means.
White feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different, but parallel, reason to understand a risk inherent in the body — and opinions about race that are distinctly different in public surveys — will lead the changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on racial issues in America are still baffling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson stand in contrast to their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing mainstream feminism to the forefront.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country’s southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming back to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a new look at the issue as an essential women’s issue, she only has to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a resonance in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had his head bent on a sofa.
Realtor Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly published and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the House Exposé, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lotto player from Harvey is coming this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwestern Perth continues, with a lucky winner getting nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit provides talk material in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated wins in the first division last month, a fitting conclusion to a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega gain of $7.5 million just weeks before.
The winning pair had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new home.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas prays in the Gladiator Arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood knee-deep in the match at the first Rheinbacher R<0xC3><0xB6>mertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were left without a trace of enthusiasm for the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat team of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiatorial missions.
First, the "provocators" were in a row with a rectangular shield and short sword, as well as leg rails on the left leg and arm rails on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and slingshot as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who took on the "Secutor" with a throwing net, trident and dagger, and after a short fight hit the boys to the ground.
Then the swords metallized, the shields created, and the slingshots flew roaring through the arena, which could become a fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an eye that was always attentive.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era liveable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends of the Roman Canal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of it were also to be admired during the Roman day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at L<0xC3><0xBC>ftelberg.
The Frontinus company faced the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The R<0xC3><0xB6>mervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the R<0xC3><0xB6>mervilla.
Impressively, too, the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footprints of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland (Landesverband Rheinland) had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord business park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a gut were found for drying grain and for m<0xC3><0xA4>lzen.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the German invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her school, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal grapples on watchtowers, as the Roman students used to do.
At the stand of the Roman thermal baths Z<0xC3><0xBC>lpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, craft glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park with the original Roman travel car, drawn by two cold flowers, and also passed the impressive state of the City High School, which presented the results of its "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014 proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is supposed to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered and will remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
Here, for example, a Roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the rolling Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and presenting a fun lecture on popular understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible at first glance, are to be made visible again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will remind of the discovery of the Berkum Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is straining West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies go to great lengths.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is inflicting a severe blow on the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are ravaged - the virus has severely added to the region.
Even some international companies are already going to distance themselves.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people suffering from the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have already died and thousands more have died.
Foreign companies are withdrawing employees
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, companies are shutting down their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their homes to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, rot in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris-based expert on West Africa’s economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore directly and urgently feeling the consequences of the epidemic: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatening image damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the strained state budgets of the states
The disease also burdens the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
Moody's fears that its budgets will be heavily burdened by high spending on the health care system and the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide $60 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 million) to the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
However, the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Guards celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival from 12 to 14 September are underway at the Tannenwald Shooting Club.
On Friday, September 12, a big evening of entertainment with the group "Village Rockers" is planned.
Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big firefight.
Afterwards, in the large party tent, the mood evening is with the "Stoapf<0xC3><0xA4>lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big feast at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the prize distribution of the federal and Gauschie<0xC3><0x9F>en.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 celebrants with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert F<0xC3><0xBC>racker.
The original name "Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on March 21, the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room stub and small caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April in the inn Lukas the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau have risen from the dead.
Karl M<0xC3><0xA4>rz and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult initial period as a shooting master, in which it was mainly a matter of finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schutzenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were broken annually and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof H<0xC3><0xA4>rteis".
After 2,700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Fr. Strasser granted the ecclesial blessing for the new guard rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauschie<0xC3><0x9F>en, associated with the solemn consecration of the new Schutzenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A B<0xC3><0xB6>ller Group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became B<0xC3><0xB6>llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "B<0xC3><0xB6>llers" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian B<0xC3><0xB6>ller Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members last year modernized the rooms and the shooting range at the Berngauer Hof, bringing the latest technology to the forefront.
Eleven teams in round-robin matches
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzenverein.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round-robin competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team, with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann, advanced from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tzengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstechen, carnival and king's ball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have a tradition.
The patrons are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on his return to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst into lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to reporters.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an ashtray race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had hit the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart should face charges.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start to 12th position, Stewart had already advanced to the top 10 shortly after and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Cars with the No. 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-loving young man looking for
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to a fight.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn create all-day classes at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now more and more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you are interested in dancing, you can take part in the training session on Thursdays between 5 pm and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 pm and 6:30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistra<0xC3><0x9F>e 9, without obligation.
“The training regularly starts with a warm-up program,” says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the sociability is not too short.
“We also go to dinner, watch dance films and we have already spent the night in the dance room,” reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dance, you can also enjoy one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always take classes in the fields of children's dance/jazz dance, children's ballet, video-clip-dancing and hip-hop on Wednesdays.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can stop by and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria staged a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, said the Director General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov to the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, which allegedly also involved Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army has today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk.
The army said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top leadership of the army, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have shot down a combat aircraft and two military helicopters once again, according to their own account.
About 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been shelled on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the channel 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk region under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital, Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a representative of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the agreement.
"Today we must face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements of the Russian side, it emerges "that they consider us as opponents".
A stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A “Readiness Action Plan” to be finalised at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official information, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The talks are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union on whether to send a representative to the talks will still be pending.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU Energy Commissioner G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe derives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel: Toll will come "very clear"
Now, the Chancellor has made it clear once again.
However, it is not an open letter for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out against the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To put it very clearly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin.
For the time being, however, Merkel has not settled on a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, "certain parameters" are called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and this is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways of activating more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house examining a separate concept to reward highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement was never intended to undermine all the county and federal roads," said the CDU chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalian parliament.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverband Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung (New Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>ck newspaper) on Monday.
"With the toll the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners are not allowed to be additionally charged according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the car taxes.
However, under EU law, the model must not be detrimental to foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK shared that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe gait and crooked toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich Ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: “As a child I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I kept falling and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to ride a skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I received the reply, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing, her CMT was found.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, no more shots have been fired at the former troop training ground in M<0xC3><0xBC>nsingen.
Nevertheless, every month deadly ammunition still appears in the heart of the biosphere area Schw<0xC3><0xA4>bische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the troop training ground in M<0xC3><0xBC>nsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated routes.
Taxation of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from revenue in 2012 of $26.6 billion.
The companies’ state and local tax burden rose 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining 2009 and 2010 rulings.
State taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in companies’ property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of this profit came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012—an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values isn’t as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over a fifth of corporate tax filings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“In Maryland, a large portion of the property, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market.
Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not increase uniformly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower-than-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes at 6 percent in all three jurisdictions (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes and overall a better tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, so they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses — a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized under — in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cuts affect the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city,” said the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the twelve-million-metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li warned.
Therefore, people also possess the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would consult in Germany about a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the official from Guangzhou came across with a shepherd's gummy bear - but with red wine, which was served for food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Order.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician said.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the air connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground during his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
A well-kept partnership
The mad vice-party chief of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor had been removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The move against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is being vigorously enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "squeezing the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter has been hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We all press our thumbs.
Her mother was reportedly admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, more stringent environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will be on sale from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1st receive a label on which the buyer can see at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer — and video producer, and a host of other things — is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-informed people give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded somewhat boringly, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who explain that they’d rather play sports than watch, it’s hard to grasp the attraction that comes from watching others play, rather than taking control of the console itself.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-paced runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso isn’t involved, his Twitch channel probably isn’t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the H<0xC3><0xBC>pfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air party in the Burggarten.
Sometimes the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt swede l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Sunday evening, when the first visitors opened up to the open air.
A celebration for all generations, the organizers had promised.
And they succeeded.
Around the care stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the near and further surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, rocked with their feet in a row, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were in demand.
And that’s across generations.
While some grumbled on blankets on the extra-chartered white sand at the beach bar, others huddled at a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the youngster roamed on the H<0xC3><0xBC>pfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of children’s makeup, the volunteer helpers, in the truest sense of the word, had to do everything in their power to become the Andrang Lord and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he stomped on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attraction of the festival did not stop there.
“More people came than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a “success across the board.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repeat of the big party next year.
Although work still needs to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made a first statement on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said it was annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The response was very good.
In an initial cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who huddled in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox therefore broke their appearance nervously.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire pan.
“But next year they will be there,” says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, too, the organizers have to insert criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"You have taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems quite so closely.
I think it’s very good that some people are not only stupid chatter, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!", writes Stephanie Jen<0xC3><0x9F> to Amula.
Now, the organizers have a year to put aside these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the space observation radar TIRA, the cover, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old casing is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new cover will be placed.
As long as the weather is good, the action should go over the stage earlier this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge takes a piss
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so hard during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she cut her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stood still,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I realized something wasn't right.
My mother and sister saw that too and almost laughed in their pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to have her jaw tightened after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to pull back together again soon?
Finally, there was a constant dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board is considering a possible collaboration.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to differ.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down one day,” Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg reports.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull back together in the future.
This way, visible successes can be achieved more quickly.
While the Burgfreunde around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the Burgverein around Sj<0xC3><0xB6>berg stands the "development and experience" of the terrain at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Burgfreunde, said he was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been present to the Burgfreunden.
A new chairman is to be found in a meeting of members in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club's activities rest out of respect." This "thought phase" had been necessary to "consider how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad T<0xC3><0xB6>lz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The T<0xC3><0xB6>lzer wants to "but very much to continue working on the project".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl’s eyes in the near future.
He praised Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the rebuilding of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first, too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward. A "all-in-one" feature could be created for the city of Fl<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0x9F>er.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might move something at this point.
Their goal, to document the story first, “is important and good.”
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever Ways to Save on University Textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast-paced second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books he needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management shared that on average, students spend more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and study materials, but there are different cost mitigation options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebo’s vice president, Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price they have in campus bookstores.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If the notes of other or normal traces of use do not matter to you, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com to have $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous spending is allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the terms and conditions of the business in which you rent, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, underlining or traces of use.
Tenant beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for determining the price of books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before placing an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard road.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-directed film "Sex Tape" grossed only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon's Taming Made Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in children’s films could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst year" for children's films to date and described "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to movies for a slightly older audience, it seems like the quality of the movies isn’t necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie launch shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released Jungle Book film, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenues with streaming content worth $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year’s $837 million revenue.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics and for prophesying a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
Due to the potential box office hitters expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic, however:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply “cyclical,” telling Hollywood reporters, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted in order to tighten the league classification, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
As a result, those who have not ascended have descended.
For example, G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the descent, but will play only fifth-class next season.
Torpedoes remain fourth-class ladies, despite their grand march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve join the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen clubs.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new District Oberliga S<0xC3><0xBC>d.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB L<0xC3><0xB6>dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC meet.
In the district league, the regional representatives are Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
G<0xC3><0xBC>ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II is still starting - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern season, among others, Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/W<0xC3><0xB6>llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the district level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd cycle classes achieve the desired strength, here the innovative and agile district manager will already have to think.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend and spoke to protesters who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers fly out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bush hikers were brought to safety with the rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett’s Leap in Blackheath for their tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home.
A search party from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured herself on her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were admitted to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with a ambulance.
Government-hostile protests escalate in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, there were clashes of about 3,000 protesters with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters tried to break into Sharif’s residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict “without wasting time and without resorting to violence” after a meeting at army headquarters on Sunday night.
"The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state," the statement said.
The escalating violence has raised concerns about an intervention by the military, which has already purged more often in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refused to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said the same thing.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning last May's parliamentary election by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
Demonstrators had initially stood peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to invade Sharif’s residence.
H<0xC3><0xBC>tteldorfer placed third in the table after his second win of the season.
With the 2-0 win over Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig, a bitter week for Rapid on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a dead end in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goaltender Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
With the second win of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the playoffs.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent lead volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute has set the course for victory.
“I thought I was going to get all the frustration out of Thursday and put him under the sledge,” the 26-year-old said with a smile.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 November 2010, that was for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me it's something very special, I'm from the Rapid next-door," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirror-inverted.
He deserves the goal, he has already made some assists this year," Barisic said.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written too.
"Thank God we had some luck today," Schrammel said, adding that the results had not been right, "but the playing field has always been good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games you have been better than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less gratifying for him: "That we have finally played to zero again".
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their debut debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," said Barisic, who has lost players with Behrendt and Pavelic in the past three days, "who have been very stable lately."
The country play break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and add a bit to the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One who seems to find a special place in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over the pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 via the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably had a bit of luck too, but at some point luck has to come back to us too.
Now was the time," Hofmann said.
He did, however, call for concentrated further work: "You can't always see it in black and white.
We haven’t played as badly as this has been shown in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role to the team.
It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They are holding on to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-attack "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We had too few graduations.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It started badly, but then we found the net and even made a goal.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
There is rest under this peak
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle edition of the summer series "My piece of Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ner Gl<0xC3><0xBC>ck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the depicted specimen is the "Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche" above Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes by pools, basalt stone piles and basalt stone lakes.
A bit below the quarry from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and resembles an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and interviewed elderly people from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to find out what kind of relationship it has with the Gei<0xC3><0x9F>ruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago the goatherds were supposed to have driven their animals from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the laboriously rowed and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted by the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because goats are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections, you should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixes.
A hiking trail leads from Unterwei<0xC3><0x9F>enbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are signposted, which go up the direction of Hochrh<0xC3><0xB6>n and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle that is searched for in our next task is rarely found in the height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ner happiness"?

After weeks of debauchery, Italy’s prime minister and current EU president, Matteo Renzi, has pushed past strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week to nominate his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, succeeding Britain’s Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-owned daily newspaper La Repubblica reflects, the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base that is constantly against him, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a more moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as Council President, Donald Tusk, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, in order to establish a political balance.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will also be a deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament’s approval is still pending and is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an “important recognition” of Italy’s role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has been at the helm of the party for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will show herself to rise to the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her political career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic center party Margherita in 2008 to form the current Social Democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered high party politics, working in the department of foreign policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party’s votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a stake in it.
The expectations in Brussels, the new EU foreign minister has insufficient diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini’s mistrustful realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being pursued and defamed as a “Russia-friendly course”.
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gazprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with outrage in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas B<0xC3><0xBC>cherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages, as well as trainers, will drive to Oberammergau for a team-building event, including a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
Socialists in France should “keep their mouths shut and put France in order,” Francois Hollande’s main ally said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval among the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a easing of the regime by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show "union" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw sand into the gear where she appeared at a meeting of apostate Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists’ constant trench fighting and said she could not imagine the new Valls government going to last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one did not even survive a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of winning early elections and was ready to go to the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment rates.
“There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy customer base, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino mix group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the listing of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A Beijing-based group swung the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates to run for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed by Beijing loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote, prompting pro-democracy activists to heed their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial centre with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city’s business district and organizing a sit-in there.
Li’s survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, as well as the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in front of the office of the top leadership in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Until the end of the 150-year colonial rule in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom had no democratic elements.
Putin calls on Kiev to host “state talks” with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region, according to Russian media reports.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Ukraine would need to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists in taking over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiysk to become a de facto ally with Russia.
In an interview with state television Channel One, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military campaign to recapture separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "Neurosland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "captured in their illusions", Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification by the Kremlin spokesman to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscored Russia’s leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and polls from the time before the conflict showed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy raised by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries, which make important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inauguration speech on June 7, suggested that Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the Constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons and insurgency are being blamed on Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on a level playing field followed a further push by rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists seized control of Novoasaovsk, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have begun to consolidate Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at an EU leadership meeting in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said in a report in Kiev on Saturday.
The first alleged 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said.
Nude photo scandal about Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no fuss about his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-Promises.
The film city is in turmoil after a series of unique photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has over 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "the tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne have reportedly also released private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Noblest, who had engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly said the hack was "disgusting" and that those affected "felt hurt".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying on top without in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence' told TMZ: "It's a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Bikers, joggers and hikers took part yesterday in the 8th bike ride on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>er Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-stricken children".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was an easy training for the others.
They all agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery rode a bicycle to the Feldberg.
For the good cause.
It is easy for him to put away the small musculoskeletal system, especially since his participation on the 8th bike ride on the Gro<0xC3><0x9F>er Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancerous Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"Now I know I can do it - great!"
Small puss on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Upper Ursula city parliament, many of the 718 participants went to the mountains yesterday in the early stages and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometer-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Die<0xC3><0x9F>ner, for example.
The green-politician from the Kreistag – red dress, red bike – did something else at the start on understatement (“A lot of professionals, that’s where the goal is!”), but then turned out to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without a breath.
He also went through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Gr<0xC3><0xBC>neisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to participate - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to stomp up again immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 am at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
I also had fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilogram race bike.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad" road, although they are also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger, who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, prove that it also went up smoothly without a wheel.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said: "I know" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge trail, only that he pulls the sled himself.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent on the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Biking on the Great Feldberg", gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
