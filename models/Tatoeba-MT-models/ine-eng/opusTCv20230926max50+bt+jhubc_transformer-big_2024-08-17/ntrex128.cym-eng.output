ACs Wales worried they’ll ‘look real’
Some ACs are concerned about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Parliament in Welsh).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly in Senedd Cymru.
There are concerns across the political spectrum that this could be a contentious issue.
The AC of Labour party said its group was worried because the title "crushed with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called by such names.
He said the group as a whole was "unhappy" with the suggestion and that they had offered other options.
A Welsh Keeper said his group was keeping an "open mind" about the name change, but it was suggested that there was not much difference between MWP and "Muppet".
The ASC's Welsh translation does not cause so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, it will be a matter for the members themselves to make the final decision on any descriptions to the titles of Members of the Assembly."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the power to the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. There was widespread support to call for the assembly in Senedd Cymru.
In terms of the Assembly Members' title, the Commission favoured the Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
According to the statement, ACs suggest other options, but the work of coming to a consensus could cause the President, Elin Jones, to end. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the disqualification of ACs and the design of the committee's system.
The ACs will have the final vote on what they should be called upon to discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia."
This popular vote was formed in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has lasted for decades with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory. It has objected to the country's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO circles.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's name change vote and has said he will disregard the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church in Tewi as Churches in Harlem Face Difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I've spoken to," Mr. Adams said.
Today, it's one of them."
He said he could understand why the bars had disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Bars are now not considered in community living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As far as churches are concerned, the money obtained through the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to, "and sooner or later, they will be back in the same old situation."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condos full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the area's sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all of these churches will close early because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - The Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved from there in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshipping nearby came to own the building.
St. Martin's Church was transferred to a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the retailers on 125th Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to employ or raise black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's chieftains made plans for reconstruction, the bells were commissioned.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin's Church, was proud to call them "the heads of the poor."
The expert who sang the bells in July gave them another name: "Cultural treasure" and "unique historical equipment."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noticed that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, and moved to sing the larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not have anyone in its place.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church in recent months has been a complex history of businessmen and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's lay leaders, and others by the Bishopric.
The parish - the parish's governing body that includes lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to indicate concerns that the diocese would have been "trying to pass on the costs" to the parish, although the parish had not been involved in the recruitment and recruitment of parishioners.
There were some who complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy as He Jumps to Search for Him in California
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday as he plummeted to look for germs in California on the first day of the term.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been flirting with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when the boy heard screaming for help. Then he swam to him with a group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was excited when he caught a weasel at first. But, upon reaching the boy, Hammel told him "notice that he is shouting, 'I've been driven!
I've been betrayed!"
The bridge of his shoulder was torn open.”
I begged everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’ said Hammel.
The boy was lifted from the water in a helicopter and transported to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in a serious condition.
We don't know what kind of person was responsible for the attack.
In a brief to the media, the lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim had sustained injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas. This was done for 48 hours for security and investigation purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty products in the form of department stores that include specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn market that is still growing although fashion sales and goods to the home are falling, the more beauty eggs of this size will be trialled in 11 shops across the country.
This investment comes in a world of beauty as supermarkets search for ways to use empty shelves after being chased for TV sets, microwaves and goods to the home.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Colour Boutique collection so that most of the products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly sought after among young shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be trialling concessions at two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying some food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with the discounters Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and goods without being food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos's exports into hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat's exports since she bought the two chains two years ago. She says that has reinforced food sales and ensured acquisitions are more profitable.
He failed to make the previous effort of the supermarket to re-evaluate its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership came to an end following a question about how to share the store's revenue in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, the chain owner of Lloyds Pharmacy. The business consisted of 281 stores and was sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
Lloyds said it would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty heroes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained co-workers who will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a vital beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones has been fired after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, was a disappointment after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand accessories and goods at home.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of this morning's presenters, had posted a message on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den's stars, is puzzled after Holly Willoughby pulled out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was a "controversy" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time for Truly's beloved and their brands.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune, an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her long-term future and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and it was so close to launch.
There is a full warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow, and those are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products, including headphones, headphones, clothes and household goods. This could also mean further delays before launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
He founded Willoughby Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter on ITV.
Last night, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We wouldn't be paying attention to his business issues."
It was difficult, of course, ‘and then we fell in love’
He made fun of the end of the criticism he would get from the news media for making a "presidential" comment, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he's been listening to the news.
"I didn't give up anything."
Kim said he wanted to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the discussions on de-clarification have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not believe that the U.S. is a good country.
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was a lot more confident in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - to stop testing rockets, help release hostages and ensure the rest of the U.S. military returns home.
He went on to justify his unusual method of acting in terms of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake destroys the island, killing hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, something necessary to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've explained that they don't ask for international help, so it's quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, they are not yet sure if foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said officials from Indonesia were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be able to provide support.
Because the earth is constantly crumbling in Indonesia, the country is no longer ready enough for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
It seems that there was no siren warning about the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been given, and that has contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the many islands of Indonesia at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stranded in Lombok is treating the earthquake victims on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racist infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a ton of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a thorn in Mr. Joko's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing nominal tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form on the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other indiscriminate weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool team, scoring an even goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing a Premier League game to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was bowled by Xherdan Shaqiri and he had about 30 goals from Chelsea with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before shooting towards the furthest post.
The ball raised high above the box as she moved towards the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball came down for Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and dropped the ball into the net.
"I was trying to get to that site and get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing whenever possible, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I kicked the ball without thinking too much about it, just go for it."
Half-time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea team shooter passed the ball with his bat back to Mateo Kovacic that time, before turning away near the middle of the field and sprinting into half Liverpool.
Kovacic gave the bass ‘kick and go’ fast in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked the ball forward skillfully between the defenders of the other team, leading Hazard to the box.
Hazard was earlier than the defender who ended up in the net the furthest post with a chic with his left foot passing to Alisson Becker, one of Liverpool's players.
Liverpool play against Napoli in a group match in the Premier League at 3pm on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton at the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The total number of deaths following an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
It was noted that many people were stuck in the middle of buildings that collapsed when the magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit on Friday, an earthquake that caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which includes more than 380,000 people, was covered with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was beaten to death.
An investigation into the murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Penbedw, Watersheds, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found crushed on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area to let them know if they heard or saw anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'Although the investigation is only just beginning, I would ask anyone who was in the John Street area in Penbedw to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on dashboard cameras, they should contact us in case they have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found came from the Penbedw area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the site to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police say they are in the process of reporting the victim's closest relationship.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews is trying to get back to his apartment but police have told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard it.
Residents are now told they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed back in.
One of the police officers was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
The woman reached the spot in her tears.
She keeps saying, ‘This is so terrible.’
At 2 p.m., there were two police stations in the cord and there was another one outside.
A number of officers were standing in the cord monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with a record of 247 30 September.
Cromwell’s sculpture outside the Senedd is the latest memorial to be part of the ‘rewamping history’
Getting rid of the statue would be a deliberate justice for the horrific destruction that caused so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction done by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one "truth" that was "trying to reshape history".
John Goldsmith, Chair of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was imperative, in the current debate about the removal of statues, that Oliver Cromell's figure outside St. Stephen's Bay would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for carrying out or ordering the econoclastism of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent portrait of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of a figure's history that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a figure who defended the parliament from external pressure, the kingdom in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not, and that's an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has guided the development of our country since then and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of the debate.
His accomplishments as a Defender Lord are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Mochyn Rheibus Kills a Farmer from China
A pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, known by his nickname ‘Yuan’, had been found dead near a pig's neck in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province. His arteries had broken and he was bleeding.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 badges in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the neighboring pig's trunk door was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the trunk and there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had torn the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My head's legs had been torn and they were all blood," said the head, who was nicknamed "Wu," according to a quote in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
It wasn't the yuan or its tail that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his ox in 2012, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can cause them to behave like that.
"They're being cowardly.
They're young, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa hurricane causes heavy rain over a large area of southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Corwynt Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of the western coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa hurricane will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had 85 mya winds, a Category 1 wind gust, from 5am Eastern Time on Sunday. The gust was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastwards towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a thunderstorm, the storm will begin to push northwards towards a tropical wetness
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching storm causing heavy rain over the south-west during the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause a dangerous large flood, a stream of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Expect as much as 2 to 4 inches of hand in parts of the southeast, especially over many of Arizona.
It is possible that a large flood with the conditions will worsen rapidly due to the diffused nature of tropical rain.
It would be very harmless to venture out into the desert on foot with a threat of a trophic hand.
Heavy rain could cause the falls to become wild rivers and a storm of creeks and creeks will cause strong winds and puffs of dust in the area.
The approaching storm will cause some local heavy hand in parts of the South California coast.
It is possible that a total of more than half an inch of hand will fall, which could cause a small flow of rubble and gravel roads.
This would be the area's first rainfall during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical rains will begin arriving in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the more widespread rains late Monday and Tuesday night.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change tremendously throughout the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature through the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the mid- and eastern U.S. are expected to start hot in October with temperatures in the 1980s from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of higher than average temperatures for the U.S. East throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million listen to Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, testify on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters disrupting routine programs to broadcast the unexpected turnaround that occurred on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake noted that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her inappropriately and tried to take her clothes off at a party in high school, and he was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company counted the average number of audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And usually, Nielsen has some trouble measuring people who are watching in offices.
To give perspective, the size of this audience was similar to an audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's guests of opinion have given strong support to appoint Kavanaugh, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was also a lot of interest following the hearing.
Flake was the most prominent figure in the play on Friday.
After the moderate Republicans' office said it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras with protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He was standing looking down for a few minutes as he got a headache, living on TV on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the lift closed, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filming live hours later, when it became time for the Voting Judgement Committee to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senedd.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee by the following week, a result which has been encouraged by the least-responsible Democrats.
Flake was convicted in part after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British MP May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ in Brexit case
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who are critical of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was critical of what she calls her Chequers Brexit plan, saying she was "all ridiculous" to offer a price she should pay for Brexit.
The case of the shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrest Tyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of the LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Tyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to prison on suspicion of secondary murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims has lost his glasses during the shooting.
The police found the spectral on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, the CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a $350,000 fund, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying a gunshot wound to the head into the neck is the cause of death.
The department commends the task of tasking Louisiana State Police refugees, the county's police crime laboratory, South University police, and the area's citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the area's law enforcement team for its "dignity and its work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot and six-inch frontrunner was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and that they were "frightened" after hearing about Wayde's death.
That's the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
Firefighters take charge of Mexico City
A toll from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Reduction had warned the people of Mexico on Saturday not to go near the volcano after the activity increased in the cave and 183 gas and dust emissions were recorded over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of concussions and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of clay covering the front windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
The police clash with Catalan separatists before celebrating a year since the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-terrorist police and as thousands joined rival protests to mark a year since Catalonia's divided vote on secession.
A group of people in mosques who were in favor of separating the anti-demonstration police who were holding them back with eggs and powder paint, created dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day, with the police using their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't forgive" and individual protesters were shouting "Life in Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to local media.
Tensions are still high in this area that currently has independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who are separatists.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but many people did not come to vote and those who opposed separation had significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Groups in favor of independence were in a Friday night camp to prevent dissent in favor of the national police.
The opposition was in front of him, but he was forced to follow another path.
According to Narcissus Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the separations with his wife, was no longer faithful about gaining independence to Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry with happiness when they were able to vote but we are back in the same old situation now," he said.
Although they managed to win a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, groups that are in favour of independence have found it difficult to keep the momentum going this year and many of their most well-known leaders have either helped out on their own or have resorted to blackmail for themselves.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been agitating the waters during the collision.
The feeling of guilt is growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed since last year's trial, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the excesses we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's possible that a crossbow has been shot to the car's head as well.
Menga's shot secures 1-0 victory for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal over Livingston secures victory for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the second time in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in an instant.
Gerrard's team have not won a home game in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, who are on top and eight points ahead of them.
Before that, the Rangers will hold a game against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has beaten six consecutive games in the sub-section, and head coach Holt has not lost a game since he traded Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should have been on the front line long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but weakened his effort across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his effort wide after sliding to meet Craig Halkett's header across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the others in certain places.
And that's how the all-important goal was achieved.
The Rangers donated a free-kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to help Menga, who threw the ball and scored from the centre of the box.
By then, the Rangers were in control of possession of the ball but couldn't break through the home team's defenders and the goalie, Liam Kelly, didn't worry much.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Outan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from another set played by Livingston.
Crossers came to Livingston's bag continuously and they continued to be cleared, and two were entitled to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the player's deputy, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - to dismiss them.
‘Amazing performance’ by Livingston –
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's an amazing performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise expectations on this route that is going up.
Their style of play and staff hasn't changed much since they reached the top, but Holt has to be commended for the way he has inspired the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, arranging an extremely orderly defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have a lot of spirit.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard's control, those standards were not to be seen.
They had a lot of grip on their last ball - just once they opened the home side - and there was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Welcome to the home of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne.
It was a blue sky and everyone was smiling on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the final day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve ties between NATO allies.
They have disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come to the side of the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Greens – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome them to the country.
These protests reflect the rift associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is considered an autocrat by others.
Car crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A man has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The crash came a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and report to his closest relative.
Road closures and diversions have been set up and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been injured in a fire
Six officers have been injured in a fire in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The shooting took place at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the outbreak, which involves eight inmates and occurs in only one wing.
The minor injuries that the officers had on their faces on the site were treated.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Prisoners with specialist training have gone there to deal with this event which continues at Her Majesty Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not condone violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could spend more time in prison."
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was said that the governor of the prison had been treated in the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-terrorism officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious heist where the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Corwynt Rosa is a Major Flood Threat in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Can Benefit Dry Areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the rest of Corwyn Rosa travels across the Desert's Southwest, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep an eye on major flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, turning hand late Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
"Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Centre on Winds predict between 2 and 4 inches of hand, with some rare examples of a total of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon Edge.
Other areas in the Southwest of the Desert including the Great Basin and Mid-range Rockies are likely to get between 1 and 2 inches, with some cases of a total of up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of having a major flood, Rosa's rain can be of benefit to them as they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because there are dry conditions in the Southwest at the moment.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona experiences at least extreme dryness, the highest category but one," weather.com said.
Initially, the Rosa Trail will lead to land along the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, who was still as strong as a Sunday morning thunderstorm with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northwards traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, so it weakens.
Because of this, the hurricane is expected to reach land in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of hand is expected from Baja California into northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and south to Utah arriving late on Tuesday night.
"The main danger to be expected from Rosa or the remnants of the hurricane is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest U.S. Desert," the National Wind Center said.
It is expected that this rain will create a large flood that can endanger life as well as a flood of rubble in the desert and landslides on mountainous land.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three boys are in their teens and one 20-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and remains in a "settled" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officials have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone from what happened to the presentation of that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has 'sentenced from resentment and anger' of Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's outrageous and shameful tactics," Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said Mr Kavanaugh had "been a victim of resentment and anger" by the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday and was emphatic in his denial of Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had been sexually abused decades ago, and both in their forties.
Ford testified in the hearing about his claim as well.
The President said Saturday that "the people of America have seen the beauty and the standard and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal professionals of our age, a lawyer with an outstanding history of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in North Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of the Republican assembly in the mid-term elections.
"It's five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our age.
I'm not trying, but I'm really trying," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "resist and hinder."
The first key operational vote on the floor of the Senedd on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them being pushed away as huge waves cut across the beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters hit the beach late at night, sweeping many away and killing them and damaging anything along the way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was received yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they did not run from there immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said in a statement.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, bridges, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 bhp (497 mph) before hitting the beach edge.
Some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs of the air released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, bridges had collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city was still reeling from the backlash.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that included 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the energy released by Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a long and gloomy bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "major" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
"There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but the situation could get worse," he said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man can be heard screaming at people in the street below warning them that a tsunami is on its way.
Within minutes, a wall of water was hitting the shore, carrying buildings found from there.
Reuters was not able to verify the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that triggered communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but there is a real need for food and other essentials on those who have had to leave their homes.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to go to the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
She's in a terrible situation.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived in the city of Palu safely, where the workers are sheltered in tarpaulin shelters set up in their office yard, they have been passing torched scenes on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups get to grips with the ill-advised process of providing emergency aid, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies and staff cannot be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the state level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can get international support, but there is no status yet."
As she spent the night in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing were hoping that their loved ones would live through some miracle, which would alleviate some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled from a cart.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been trapped under a rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier in the month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said his disciples were among the others who are hanging in the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage," he said.
In the hours after the paragliding community heard the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
But only one gray tick was next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as ATM machine gets refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from one of Brink's employees who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been vacating an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man made "a run behind the Brink worker" and brought a bag of money that was to be provided.
Witnesses saw many other people fleeing the site, according to the statement, but the police did not identify the number that was part of the incident.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In a post on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has since been called Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He's going on the show instead of Ariana Grande, the American singer who pulled back because of "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As well as being a nod to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘yes’ is the word that’s most often used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, which airs on the radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
The name of Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye only – reflecting the good, the bad and the confusion, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been given various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has also been using his name varying in terms of the heifer and the butterflies.
AMLO in Mexico pledges not to use troops against civilians
Mexico's president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloody crackdown on students.
At Tlatelolco Plaza on Sunday, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the military to defeat the people of Mexico."
Soldiers fired during a peaceful protest on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexico's young people by providing support to those who study and open more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities mean that young people are attracted to crime gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the money it spends on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make announcements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy in general.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in all innovation links by 2030.
"Ensuring double the funding for research in the field of artificial understanding would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of artificial understanding," Lee said.
Doubling the funding could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is Chief Executive of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face+.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he was working on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best Othello player in America. He later became an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been trying to hire bright college students from universities to work on artificial intelligence recently.
Lee also said that changes to the migration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to people with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Science provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Institute of Science and other government institutions provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is to include partners from the industry and academia, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence is being formed.
And this month DARPA announced an investment in an enterprise called AI Next.
On behalf of the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in Artificial Intelligence Research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for months.
Macedonia's citizens vote in a referendum to change the country's constitution
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's largest Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
This is the referendum's voting question: "Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the fall of Yugoslavia, has access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said they will expect the result of the vote to make it a definite vote.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds would have to be in the parliament.
The county's election commission said there was no mention of any discrepancies by 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of the voters who had registered to vote did so.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would allow the country to join NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of a tent set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join in being able to hold our heads high, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says he will become a member of NATO to secure the investment he really needs on Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
According to a vote established last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - which is lower than the necessary number.
Another vote, held by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious blow to the Western-backed government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, City of Manchester, passes all Brighton defenders and gets a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that look awfully easy as he scored in the 65th minute.
The shooter from the Argentinian base was in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
One defender pushed away before running earlier than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he gave the ball to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, and used his right shoe to beat Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot to the right side of the net.
Aguero is having some problems with his feet," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We were talking about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea their first advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the territory of Brighton that time.
He gave a lovely kick through the players along the back leg to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the furthest post.
Chelsea's forward kicked the ball into the net before sliding over the boundaries.
Manchester City play Hoffenheim in the Champions League playoff group at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second-chance games, there is not much reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the sidelines on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications in terms of second chance games for the Rockies, who save the Los Angeles Dodgers from one game in the NL West league.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still hoping to secure their place in the first group.
"While we are not playing for anything, at least we can tread the rubber knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in a game like that?"
The Nationals haven't announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they say they're keen to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-hander who plays for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout’ shots in 220 2/3 batting this season.
Trump's visit to North Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and he spoke about the importance of the Republic's assembly in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done will be in place in November.
Five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our age.
This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not applying but I’m really applying, that’s why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see the horrible, horrible radical group here, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take the power back by using whatever means it takes, you see the resilience, the resilience.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to be fooled to get power and control, they want to get power and control, we're not going to give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and stop."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "flin and casserole and unpleasant and successful."
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Parliamentary Judging Committee, and loud rumblings were heard among the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
"Did you share the document?"
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a minute - that was an example of poor body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer a work of art.
They don't listen to the people who say it.
When members of Momentum's executive committee in my local constituency voted to authorize me, that was a big surprise.
After all, I'm the latest of many Labour MPs to hear that we're not welcome - and that's what we're saying.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she stands resolutely against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the offer of a car was in my judgment for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Disagreement with him about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in their circle.
The notice for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday stated "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the GC's Friday night meetings have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in most of the meetings today and we have long forgotten the promise of a "more friendly, more tenacious" policy, whether that has ever been achieved.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not accepted in the Labour party and all views are judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader. There were co-workers that I used to think were of the same political animosity as I was starting to expect me to make a pedal turn and support views that I would never have agreed with them otherwise - whether that be on a bail or a bailout.
Whenever I speak in public - and there's no difference in what I'm actually going to say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the centre's politics, telling me I shouldn't be a candidate.
I'm not the only one who has experienced this.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my co-workers because the comments that are being addressed to me tend to be political ones.
I admire the professional and decisive nature of those co-workers who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but don't let that get the best of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not such an enthusiastic party now and with every proposal of "lack of confidence" or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion too much, then I'd be "right."
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a school pupil 32 years ago, having been moved by that government's neglect of Thatcher, a government that was responsible for the tumultuous condition of my school's classroom. Since then I have sought to promote better public services for the most deprived of it - the most deprived of it.
I've never tried to hide my politics, nor in the last election either.
No one in East Nottingham would have been able to misunderstanding my political views and the areas I disagree with in their circle with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party with the country moving towards Brexit which will hit households, households and livelihoods.
But, in fact, it's not a message to Momentum Nottingham that I have, but a message to my constituents, Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats from my non-election or political facilitators will prevent me from acting in the wrong way.
Chris Leslie is the MP for East Nottingham.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr unfurls on top
Two late applications may have delayed some of the final result, but it's certain that Ayr deserves to win this Tennent Premier League game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team that hasn't been beaten by the ten.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for maintaining the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be content," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to praise Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson applied in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, to ensure that Ayr was ahead. However, the yellow card that got the Scottish cap, Rory Hughes, which was released for the game by the Warriors, meant that Melrose was able to take advantage of that.
Climo ensured that Ayr was never more ahead with penalty chic, before he, before half time exactly, scored and converted a single application to secure a score of 17-5 for Ayr in the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and made Patrick Anderson's request, which was converted by Baggot, reduce the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of a delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on stretcher. After they restarted, Ayr got more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and yet, Melrose made the additional player pay with an unconverted request by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for Climo's tackle without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson threw the ball down behind Ayr's increasing scarmes.
Climo turned the application, as he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's punch kick and sent the forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth application.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of Still Game, hopes to move into the hospitality industry after he finds out he's been named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, along with writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series to follow will be the final series in the show's history and it is likely that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but one of Scottish Sun's sources suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of Glasgow's "fancy food business."
‘No to the sea’: Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of a sinking ship in La Paz.
Public buildings float a blue flag like the sea.
Marine centers from the Titicaca Line to the Amazon are painted with the signs: "We are the living of the sea by right.
It's his duty to recover."
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the fort that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are more pronounced than they have been for decades, as Bolivia waits for a verdict by the international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calm, and for some reason it is faithful to wait for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivian citizens will be watching the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim - after decades of tentative talks - that Chile must discuss its opening.
Evo Morales, a charismatic president who hails from Bolivia - facing a controversial battle for next year's re-election - is heavily reliant on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court isn't likely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and many wouldn't change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has insisted it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard suggests "that the case was not a complex one," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean man specializing in international law.
And instead of improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
"Bolivia's current administration has disrupted this issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' wartime rhetoric has undermined any good will Chile had after it, he suggested.
Sometime, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process is usually a quick process.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to start a new period of ties with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement over the benefits of philanthropy," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Marales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political bag.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
This is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it won't get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the member trusts Washington first.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the country's leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy that he would not be able to reach a deal, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's only a wild dream that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declaring an end to the Korean War will make the North give up.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement before Pyongyang makes significant evacuation moves in the first place.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is much doubt as to whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons that the country, more than likely, considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal That The Latest Collection Of Huge Costumes Is About To Reach Your Big Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a variety of huge and striking outfits for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which shone on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the amazing creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion platform.
One of Valentino's striking items was a colorful hat over the top of a plate decorated with a wide edge of a feather covering the heads of the models.
Among the other great accessories were watermelons decorated with games, witch hats and even pan-care - but these hats would not warm your head.
Tom Browne also revealed a collection of strange bugs - and that's in good time for the Winter Calan.
Many of the colorful lips had been sewn together and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to a grand work of art.
One of them was similar to a squib-tipping suit with snorkel and goggles, and another looked like a ia cream cone, and that one had melted.
And, if you enjoy great fashion statements - this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on the style anticipate that huge balls could reach your big street.
These large hats follow the style of ‘La Bomba', the popular two-foot wide-brimmed butterfly hats, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind these impractical hats found on social media also had another big creation on the fashion stage - a bag of balls almost as big as the model in a swimming suit who wore it.
The burnt orange raffle bag, decorated with a raffle edge and a white leather handle, was one of the most striking items in the collection of La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see big beach hats and bags arrive on the big street next summer - as the designer has made so much of an impression, it would be hard to avoid the demand for big accessories.'
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools hold a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, which are only complemented by individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), seek to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, we see modern languages still being popular topics that are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it will remain in their memory.
If you talk to someone in their own language, that will stay in the heart."
This is a powerful message to remind us that we can't rely on English only when trying to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts and include the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have obtained a high A degree.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are a member of SCIS, show that 72% of pupils have received a grade of A High in Mandarin, and that 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who got a grade of A high in Mandarin.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Now languages, such as subjects, are treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and in other places.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is a growing demand for languages in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more proposed job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment. -
No matter what career one chooses, if that person has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will immediately step forward.
According to a poll by YouGov which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. In addition, French was the only language that was spoken by a percentage of double figures, which is 15 per cent.
This is the reason why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Being able to speak a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, all schools will be different in terms of the languages they will teach.
A number of schools will focus on classic modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important to the UK when looking around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages they can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who specialize in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever may be ahead of them.
At the moment, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still vital to the country's future, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence for Scotland's young people.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron played his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the series' opening game before the start of the season on Sunday at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he will play again.
"It's going to be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this point in my career, I don't need games before the season to prepare," he said.
Time Rally West Virginia Trump, YouTube Channel
President Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the impeached Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to enlist support for the midterm elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump rally in West Virginia online below using live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings about his nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to be confirmed in the delayed parliament for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans who are facing tough elections in November to win some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to "distribute volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and add to the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to its agenda until the President travels to as many states as possible as he or she begins the important campaign term," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Hosted at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could come and fans of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia last month, a state that gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican parliamentary candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the penis polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try and give him a boost in the penis pool," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows the plow to fight forward as they go to individual matches on Sunday
After three side-by-side sessions, Saturday's four-day afternoon could be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept imagined in the sports world but it's a concept that players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say the moment is right now?
"They were on the front six points and now it's four, so we have a little moment for me to know," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plain with another penalty to play for.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails and they have enough to cheer them up, especially from Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
It's been a great experience from the start, and it's a great example.
The cheers of celebration went up as his round went ahead, he managed with a vital pitch to go on a four-one game despite being of and Thomas having been down two after two.
There was a similar scream after the pit that won the game for them on the 15, the kind of scream that tells you he doesn't think America is out of it again.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game," Speith said.
That's the only thing these players have now.
18 holes to create an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
A couple of but likes Europe four by four and they can do nothing wrong."
"Moliwood" was the only bar to not get a Saturday afternoon bag, and they didn't get a Saturday morning bag, Friday afternoon or the last nine Friday mornings either.
That run, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, which would be the same player more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their right to ride over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible, they're both at the same price on different scales.
However, it's too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, easily when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Following a bag and two doubles in the first nine, the Spaniard and Sweden were in a hole and they did not come close to climbing out of it.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of your hole.
There are four piles and fours that are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and they are leading quite a bit at the beginning of the last day, but the quarter-finals have proven that a U.S. team has the ability to fight, something that some, especially in the U.S., were suspicious.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four football games and four-quarters on Saturday 10-6 ahead of the USA.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to go and their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European squad Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the trophy after losing at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American poor squad in four morning balls going and the series to 3-1.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the four quarters, but they could not get rid of the deficit.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been called "Molliwood" after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to get four points out of their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After nurturing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they worked great together to beat Woods on American Bryson Dechambeau's rookies of 5 and 4.
Wood, who pitched himself two games on Saturday, has had some special opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who has been a staunch supporter of football in the morning, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the quartets and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka who are first and third in the world of 2 and 1.
It wasn't all about Europe on a beautiful and awe-inspiring day in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup have the team come back from being four points behind at the start of the individual games, although only an equal score is needed on the Furyk squad as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, getting around them on Sunday looks like it's beyond their ability.
North Korea says it will not be able to unilaterally adopt a child without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the U.N.'s continued sanctions were strengthening mistrust in the U.S. and that the country would not unilaterally remove its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant steps of good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear exercises and leaflets, decommissioning the site of nuclear tests, and vowing not to poison a nuclear site.
But we don't see such a response from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can de-empower ourselves first."
Although Ri has reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual response to nuclear disarmament where his North Korea will be rewarded in taking gradual steps, his statement was to be seen significantly as he did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament as a denial of nuclear disarmament.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the current U.S. president and North Korea's archbishop in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "father-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee a guarantee.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to ease the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. wants to have 'de-nuclearisation first' and they are increasing the pressure through sanctions to reach their target in a coercive manner, and they are even opposing the 'declaration to end the war,'" RI said.
"The idea that sanctions can overwhelm us is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are strengthening our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second conference between Kim and Trump, a conference the president had met in the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five years and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of nuclear disarmament and not the U.S., there would be no need for nuclear deterrence.
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US with North Korean missiles was imperative after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "rock man" on a self-defeating target.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to de-occupy, but said there was a lot of work to be done again and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea is de-occupied.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a set period for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday: "Safety Council sanctions must be enforced rigorously and unfettered until we are realising and confirming completed nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an effort to limit funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes.
Ri met with Pompeo on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go as well.
Pyongyang left in July saying there had been progress, but North Korea accused him within hours of making "orders as a gangster."
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the nuclear site and the nuclear site if the U.S. takes "corresponding steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "Compatible Steps" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump made in Singapore and moves toward normalizing relations with the U.S.
Harvard students are getting a course on getting plenty of rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is being given to undergraduates to sleep more in order to try to tackle the macho culture of studying through the night using caffeine.
Academics found that students at the world's best universities often understand when it comes to the essentials of yearning for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired by the beginning of the course after giving a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lesson, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I just getting to know this, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course still includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, the participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We are aware that the behaviour of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what the impact of smoking is on your health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse.
Making sure you get enough sleep, and that quality, should be a way for students to cope with stress, anxiety, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as a lack of sleep makes the brain think you're sluggish, making you sluggish.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical life, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after studying one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and was ‘inspired’ to try to get the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive organisation.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting a alarm for going to sleep, together with waking up, and being aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ being released by electronic screens and LED light, which can approximately affect your mood.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor game away from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's contactless team in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first win on the road since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's team won just the second time in 18 games as a manager to leave the eight-point team behind former Laird leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no sight of being able to get even.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone rises to third only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the Calum Spence lamp had to be treated to an injury to its head after something was thrown from the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and beat Ayr to reach the pre-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11 and beat Hearts last week and would be pleased with the way his organized squad defeated their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the ball when they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance at Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed his chance by hitting the ball clearly.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow couldn't hit the back post.
Rangers were in control but there was more hope than belief in them playing in the last game of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a shot from the pot after about a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless hit but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers had two shots for the target in the first half but had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes has been against the running of the game, no one can argue that they didn't deserve him for their hard work alone.
Still, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep playing plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was nervous about passing it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was a catch as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost the change had an immediate impact as the forward passed to Morelos but Kelly ran off his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's squad could have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow failed to score a corner.

And now a page from our Almanac "Bore Sun": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in NUMBER... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
An important part of science since then, Geiger became an important part of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "Is that in the world?"
Rogers: "Geiger's meter, it is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you're able to hear the effects of the atoms released by the radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Well, it makes a lot of noise!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adjusting them in a laboratory.
They will then be able to ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and they will be re-injected
A test of the vaccine shows the expected results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify foreign cells, saw your ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2 that is common in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer/regular, Professor Berzofsky explains.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a speech in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't go well
Kanye West was flown into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third from that night, Ghost Town, wearing the Make America Great Again cop, he froze against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I'll be talking to a white person and they'll be saying, 'How can you like Trump, he's hilarious?
"If I was worried about the future, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with sketches featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, a video of West freezing it was uploaded to social media by cartoonist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to woo West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They put me in the back of the room.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with that cap on.’
They've been bugging me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then after the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that he would "give up my superman crush, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments were tipped at least twice by an SNL audience and cast members were reluctant to see, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "The studio all went completely silent."
West had been added as a late second to singer Ariana Grande, as her former love of rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to many by performing the I Love it worn as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR THE HAT."
But presenter Karen Hunter was shocked that West was only "knowing himself and that's great."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their "secret") who in my opinion embraces and expresses ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Her with rapper, Snoop Dogg has been given the name Snoop Lion and of course the recent Prince musician changed his name to symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of trying to murder after a case of burglary in a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The shooting took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington killed by poisoned man
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO horror series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed off the stereotype of a macho hero, saying such roles on the screen mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes ‘something has gone wrong’ and asked how to address the toxic gender issue in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married his actress on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, recently admits that he feels strongly about tackling the problem.
“I feel strong at the moment – what has gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grow up, in terms of the problem we have now?’
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity and that because of the very masculine characters.
He went on to say: ‘What is intelligent and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they have to be a special kind of man?
In my opinion, that's one of the big questions of our age - how do we change that?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not be making any other Game of Thrones programs when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he had ‘got enough fights and horses’.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come from Game of Thrones.
‘I met a wife on the show, so in a way she gave my family to me, and my life from now on,’ he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest in Kit, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the cases were transmitted through sex, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood supplies.
But the number of people who catch HIV like this has been reduced to almost nothing, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan state.
But, year after year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
HICV transmission through gender is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was decriminalized, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is a ruse.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of these infections are due to the inadequacy of sex safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has released the data of the Republicans’ lawmakers, killing off ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘planning theories’
On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were being spread by "extreme right-wing extremists."
"Lies, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
In the meantime, the information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information spread online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address identifying the source of the posts is related to Waters' office and they released information from a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This insidious accusation is wrong and a naked lie," Waters said.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and wrongful charges - was not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
"This unfounded accusation is wrong and a naked lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former press secretary Ari Fleischer at the White House.
"It's a shame," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the nature to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
They can't be hostile.
They can't question the defendant's motivation.
They need to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters's response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by judges of appearing angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and the agency to enforce the law on the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the offenders are exposed," he said, "and that they are responsible for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new British-themed film and is to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy-drama series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Do we have a right to ask ourselves how much of a difference we will have to make in the future?
However, Johnny English's no-brainer has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second time - with his name more than anything showing that he is a comic character who has been created for cinemagoers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, this is the real spy who despite his noble claims includes a little bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed one note to by Cariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally based on the passenger and the mysterious man Atkinson was playing in a Barclaycard ad, leaving a mess behind.
There's one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved seeing Johnny English going towards a helicopter wearing a suit and the rotor blades hitting against his helmet.
Atkinson's dance with physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor is weak and oddly unnecessary, especially now that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's true woes aren't as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in the Bean neighborhood.
The idea is that Great Britain is in a big mess.
A cyber-hacker has become embroiled in Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identity of all British spies in the field, to the dismay of the undercover officer on duty - Kevin Eldon's unfortunate and small role.
This is the final step for a self-righteous, self-centered prime minister who is already suffering from enormous political irresponsibility. Emma Thompson is doing her best with the Theresa May character but there is a lot in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every spy has been compromised and that it will be some for her to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolmaster in some fancy institution now, but gives secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English fosters a school of spying similar to the School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is serving.
So the Batman and Robin get things wrong back on her Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful fatale femme Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the busy prime minister is being lured by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can deal with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous journey: dressed as servers, they set the French restaurant on fire; they create chaos when trying to get on a voltaic ship; and English causes a complete mess when trying to use a Virtual Tool to communicate with the inside
They make a great show of it in the final scene, but despite being so fun and uncontrollable, there's a little bit of a sense of children's television about the whole thing.
It's very prayerful.
And as with the other Johnny English films I can't help but think: can the British film industry not give a role to Rowan Atkinson who makes fair play with his talents?
Labour party denies it is preparing a plan for the British people to work for four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical scheme that would mean that the British people work a week of four days - but are paid for five.
According to the statement, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that employees get a three-day weekend - but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of the workers.
A change to a four-day week has been approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambition that is consistent with the party's approach towards restructuring the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, the ambition is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ‘A week of four days is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.’
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to broaden his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the ‘unnamed directors’ and ‘prophets’ of the public resource companies.
The opposition's chancellor's plans also mean that current water companies' shareholders will not be given all the money back as the Labour government could make 'deductions' on the basis of apparent evils.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of company equity; the private sector in the hands of workers, would receive annual instalments of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question that the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham that the FBI might reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you before the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, I said, ‘Would you do this?’
He was determined, determined, and unwavering."
However, Graham's vote is to be seen as strong.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a terrible accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett totally denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who calls on her can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the World Citizenship Festival, an annual musical event that features an impressive list of stars taking part and a message that is equally impressive: getting rid of poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lagoon in Central Park to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and also to raise awareness of the festival's main intention of getting rid of the 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else valuable to get a swim.
But how successful has the World Citizenship Festival been with just 12 years after reaching their goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade people to demand change or just another case of "clicktivism" - do people feel they make a difference by signing an online petition or sending an invitation?
Since 2011, the World Citizenship Festival says they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their supporters, aiming for a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from their actions, with at least $10 billion of them having been graded or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and operators from the UK who have committed to "helping children reach their full potential," pledging to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help get rid of nutritional deficiencies in the country's 47-plus countries.
"With the help of the UK government, contributors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition's ambassador, told the crowd at a 2018 L'Amour concert.
The group said the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious foods, after more than 5,000 actions were called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website asked "what makes you think we can get rid of extreme poverty?"
The World Citizenship Festival responded: "It's going to be a long and tough road - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "warchae" to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's intervention in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy as they mean to do in eastern Europe, and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to provide safeguards, to make sure that these do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke greeted the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and take up fuel instead," he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, taking the place of Russia, the cheapest option from below for consumers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to pull back from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline scheme, which Trump says makes Berlin a "slave" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that Nord Stream 2 is only an economic project that is worth $11 Billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure on and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has prompted a scathing response from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the U.S. to keep away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "considered as lame" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider it hard" to run for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider applying hard for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been relentless in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before voting."
But a pinion pole that was released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters don't think she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not stand by the poll of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research Center.
Three hundred and thirty-two percent supported such an attempt.
The penalty pool showed much more support for an attempt by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a possible attempt and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic names that have been cited as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after listing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son suffers, what he suffers from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the wounds that some of our soldiers are returning with," he told an audience in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other soldiers, "they come back differently, they come back harder and they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen have done, and all of them are on guard."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a woman, interfering in a report of domestic violence and having a gun in his possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support shillings for the new asylum police
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that rejects flattery to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC presented a friend-on-the-fly briefing on Friday in Washington supporting a asylum seeker who is challenging the police, NBC News said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police, is undisclosed.
He said his partner "and his violent sons were members of a gang" had been treated badly but U.S. officials turned down his request for a lockout on July 20.
He was held in custody in Texas.
He described the county's tournaments supporting Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legal, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that any application for a lock is adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a barrier goes against that principle," the friend-in-waiting brief said.
The twisters further argued in the brief that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the U.S. harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor."
National Tournament Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges do not give shelter to victims of domestic and gang violence in June.
"Refugees are available to individuals who leave their home countries due to persecution or fear due to their race, religion, nation, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was not meant to alleviate all the problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
In the wake of the death toll in the race to find survivors, a rescue effort is underway.
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
"He feels very anxious," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who was comforting her sick son at a migration centre in Palu city.
"Every minute, ambulances come in and bodies come in.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their homes that had been destroyed, searching through their wet properties, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which had been damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were full.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu military hospital, where they were being treated in the open air due to severe aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he spoke of feeling the earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he was sharing with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into the rubble of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then calm down.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Bullying with ‘Propaganda Notices’
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the U.S. promoting U.S.-China trade benefits, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily's addition to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, accusations China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections was a new step in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is customary for foreign governments to place trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting a growing trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and American businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China has now confirmed that bullying by running propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and press freedom by placing a notice they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newsstand down this street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find inconsistent voices that you would not see a very reflection of the diverse ideas that the people of China have about China's worrying economic path under the pressure of China, as the pressure of China's
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has rejected the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn Republicans to Alienate Women Who Vote Before Midterm Elections with Kavanaugh's Llanast
As a number of leading Republicans support the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the application of several allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record are already saying they want to go ahead with the vote.
You can't pull these things back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted whether the last-minute effort by Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona) to have an investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior councillor and national spokesperson for the leading group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters were shouting "November is a man's month!" as they protested in the Senedd hall as the Republicans who run the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blade.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be immense," Stu Rothenburg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're excited; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among women insecure on the outskirts of the cities and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony described his allegations of sexual assault against the nomination for the Supreme Court, analyses suggested that he would respond strongly if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has evolved to be a total disaster for the Republicans," Michael Steele, former chair of the National Committee of the Republicans, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the vote of the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they've handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of ISA's Priorities, a new group that is helping.
But it seems that Americans are divided as to who to coalesce following the evidences of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are sure or against believing Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are sure or a similar issue believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the Flake campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford together with at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senedd's Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court, discovered her sexual organs while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor is planning to launch a new Internet in order to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, a technology pioneer's new project, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In a select interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee teased that the Inrupt company's intention was "to control the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and to with at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is that it is up to the user to fully see who is getting what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help ensure Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create decentralized apps themselves using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial and ecosystem power to help safeguard the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the internet's illiteracy.
Following the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm really looking forward to this next week in the history of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the First World War Victoria Cross Clergy
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I has been celebrated in his native town 100 years later.
The Vice-Chancellor Bernard Vanny won an award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a hidden gunman four days later without knowing he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was laid by his two uncles in a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his uncles, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the game that won the award to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928, the Lower Vann led its fatality across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and attacks by field and machine-fired power plants."
He later rushed to the dance line and with the "greatest courage" led the line forward before rushing to a field on his own and cheering three of the crew.
Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something "that I could never compare to but that someone underestimates."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set up a torch after the march, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the parade" adding "that the courage of a real hero is shown by the support that is being given by so many people."
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in his place
Imagine this, you have stayed on your feet all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be banned from watching the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 corners, including a chess on the main card and was shown live across the goal in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the spectators in the UK were left stunned as the screen switched to Peppa Pink.
Some of them were unhappy that they stayed on their feet all night especially to watch the ornest.
One supporter on Twitter described the change to the children's card as "any kind of bad joke."
"Government regulations said the content wasn't suitable after 6 a.m. so children's programs had to be changed," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, told Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
"Shut the fuck up, yeah."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their schedule so that it would include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I'm thinking when I think about the re-appearance, we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to deal with this until it's our time on Sunday, their time on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it at five corners rather than six - as usual - we tried to give the fans too much and it was a long row.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘sublime’ because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he's grown up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has spurred him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he hadn't realized until he went to high school "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "smaller than" everyone else growing up "because she wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling differently, have given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they came to know about his sexuality.
The swimmer who has won the Olympic bronze medal twice has become a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he had expressed his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live in the open without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was unexpected."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone is going through so much at such a young age" he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be around to be in the good front row,’” he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and had died did I recognize that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also made his first-choice inspiration - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with before the Olympics and was still giving him a facelift.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who isn't at his best on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid getting an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the bi-annual event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the pennant and quarterback games.
Instead of being in the middle of the activity, as it has been so often for the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a supporter and working on his game in the hope of improving the problems he has.
Since the driver's seat wasn't even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player isn't a good choice for a Le Golf National tennis course, where the long haul punishes crippling shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth game is the face of the right-wing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleetwood's rookie to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
He had confidence in his man, though he couldn't do anything else.
"He understood the role he had today, he turned my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was anticipating more, but then she worked out and so we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most games of the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the high points of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence is an unspeakable boost to the team.
"He's tough, sarcastic, witty, he likes to have fun with people, he's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players have fun making fun of his head too, this week, which was nice to see.
It's a lot more than just a scam."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage ahead of the final day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The match was first played at Valderrama in 1997, where the team was captained by Steve Ballesteros with a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the lead down to a hammer-thick finish with Europe winning from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remind yourself that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won only by the thickness of a hammer," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 Golf team win 5 to 3 on Friday and tomorrow at 6pm.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this isn't over.
You've got to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the prize, and that is where we will focus.
I've said from the start, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what's standing behind - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, added Bjorn: "I would never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're being tested to the fullest as a golfer.
That's the message you need to give to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too."
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the big wins on the final day, as he is part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Wonder in Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, boosted his players before the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start fast as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We're setting our line so and putting the men out as we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other top European players in the order.
"I'm with this group of players in this order because I think they'll work well all the way," said Bjorn about his choice for the individual games.
Germany's New War Ship Delayed Again
A new German navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but will not be available until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit referring to a spokesman on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after it was delivered have plagued the fav of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class that were ordered by the Navy in 2007 will take the place of the old Bremen class frigates.
They will reportedly include powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles together and some mystery technologies, such as radar signatures, sub-red and less sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance and maintenance periods - the new frigates should be able to be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
But a continued delay means that the ground-breaking warships - which will allow Germany to throw its power over the sea - will be after the era by which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
The F125 was in the headlines last year, after Germany's Lynges refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were unclear, but Germany's media referred to a number of critical "software and hardware deficiencies" that meant the warship was no good for her if she had to fight.
Software shortages were particularly important as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship was over-weighted as a bear that worsened its performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to be 7,000 tons twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the price for the entire project - including training the crew - is starting to become a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion initially.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming more important than ever considering recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of Germany's parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of ships that could be intercepted."
The official said the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships having been delivered in their place.
He complained that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Lives of Stilts
New research is being done at a stop in the Scottish Highlands trying to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique mammals and will help with conservation activities in the future.
The study by scientists from the Scottish National Trust will follow the least common stigma on the soprano least stigma along with the elongated and watery stigma at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in important locations around the site to keep an eye on the activity of the bat throughout the season.
Volunteers and NHS staff will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A special sound analysis of the recordings will detect the frequency of the calls of the flock and what species are doing what.
Then a report and a landscape map will be produced in order to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor to the Scottish National Trust, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important to the bat and how they are used by all species.
The information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as silt creation and how to manage forests for bats and other related species.
The population density in the UK and in Scotland has decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their livers and leads to loss of habitat.
Wind and lightning turbines can also be dangerous, along with insect trapping paper and some chemicals in building materials, and cat attacks.
The blind man is not blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to see the pitfalls and obstacles that lie ahead.
Scotland's National Trust owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and they are deeply concerned about the scourge.
They have ten trained specialists, who carry out regular surveys, visits to pastures and occasional savings.
The organisation has established Scotland's first batting reserve at the Treave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
State manager David Thompson said the state's landscape was perfect for them.
"We've got a great area here," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other sites will help us understand more about what's needed for them to thrive."
It emphasizes the search for bats before doing any maintenance work in buildings as it could destroy one maternity ward killing up to 400 female and young bats, potentially killing the entire local population.
A bat is protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy them or destroy their lungs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Stigma Conservation Trust, has been encouraging the public to lend a hand.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our flora and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of violence as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a magazine from Germany.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the accusations of violence against him "fake news," saying people "request to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talking to Instagram Live's 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"Na, na, na, na, na.
What they said today, fake news," his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a win.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "a moral level of amount commensurate with the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in terms of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are alleged to have returned to the player's room, where he was routinely tortured, according to papers filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on her lines after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one per cent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was "afraid of retribution" and was worried about "being publicly embarrassed."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from United fans when the alleged attack occurred, and this summer moved to the Italian Juve choirs for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK would be "forever sorry" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
She added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would stop temporarily producing cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said a delay at the border could lead to job losses if there was no Brexit deal.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain were to fall out of the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact that leaving the EU without a deal will have on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what the carmakers say are risks in the supply chain if Brexit were to be without a deal.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars built on order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and shortages of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so construction would have to be put on hold.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "has been carefully drawn up to avoid those border inspections."
We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told Today on Radio 4.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of deliverables that have been very successful."
Toyota could not say how long the production work would end, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsuuvallais, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union member at the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience to once these jobs have gone they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again, the White House said.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy National Anthem Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended for another week" as the fight over the nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and blocks possible justice from the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy state legislature, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has been on Washington's agenda for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein wrote the book.
But last Monday he went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "better not" dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were present.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
This is what he said about the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being postponed for another week because of all the other things happening in the supreme court.
But we'll see and I always like to give the latest information to the press."
Some correspondents would doubt that claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the "arrest" of television journalists was not the reason for the lack of briefing, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are harassing."
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without citing any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, that's a lot better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks. This will happen instead of holding a press briefing where you can talk to the president of the USA."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or when he takes part in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
There are a number of individual submissions to the press.
In New York this week, the president showed why, in making an unflattering appearance and od at times in front of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in Scotland's NHS due to concerns over Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working for Scotland's NHS to express their appreciation in the country wishing them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer discussions between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been pushing for preparations for the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ situation.
I know that this time of year is going to be a tough one for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Co-workers across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
It's definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Abercrombie's body is undergoing surgery after a head injury.
Abercrombie's Christion linebacker who plays for Tennessee State Deigord has been given emergency surgery after suffering a head injury as the team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee team.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Rees, told reporters the injury had occurred half a time ago.
"He came to the side line and kind of fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by coaches and medical staff on the sideline before being placed on stretcher and returned for further assessment.
A Tennessee State officer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury is again" and the Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a second-year red shirt student, is in his first season with the Tennessee Territory after he was transferred from Illinois.
He had all five tackles on Saturday before he had to leave the game. That brought the season's total tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to support the home under new plans by the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be given to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and target those who earn large wages.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The additional money will promote the Government's intention to address people who sleep out.
The overpayment - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and purchase-to-install houses - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this offer to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is believed that 13 per cent of brand new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, and this increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to step into housing school.
Many of the country's wealthier areas - especially in the capital - have become "uninhabitable towns" because so many overseas buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to stop paying for affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing gap."
Mr Corbyn has announced an impressive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the conversion of people from their "wrongful" homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said I would dedicate my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for every new generation.
That's why we're trying to fix our poor housing market.
Britain will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create life here."
However, it can't be right that buying homes is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies that are located abroad, as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house far from being within reach, and the nightmare of sleeping out on the street remains far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ambition in the end is to control Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "hope in the end" is to be Scotland's team manager.
The 42-year-old Albanwor faces the challenge of resurrecting the North-West club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, the BBC's Scottish programme.
"When I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden a lot with my dad, and it's something that's brought me back.
"That's the only way I'm going to be able to do that, if I'm successful."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not afraid to follow such strong names in such a big club, and he has rejected previous proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich.
“Success for me right now will see ‘can I lead this club back to the Premier League?’”
Because of the club's structure and facilities, it belongs to the Premier League without a doubt," he said.
"It won't be an easy command to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless we can get the club back there."
It's only been three years since Ross started his career as a manager, having a period as a deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period as one of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped raise Alloa after they had fallen to the third tier, and converted St Mirren from falling to the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he's ever been in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a swearing-in point," he said as he recalled taking the hints at Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds bad because I did it right, I made a reasonable living from it, and I made a few to a high point.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through that in terms of stress and workload, but management feels right.
I always wanted to be a manager and since I've realized that, I now feel more satisfied with my world than ever before."

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot weather in the summer has boosted the profits of hard-to-find British pubs, but it has put more pressure on food chains.
Bar and pub groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but a 4.8 per cent drop in house-to-house earnings was seen, according to figures.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting company who collected the figures said: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England have stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to that of June which was in July, where they saw the previous award ceremony.
After the 1.8 per cent drop in the housing trade eaten in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Pubs and bars that sold drinks performed best by seeing more progress than they saw homes eat up from a loss.
He also suffered from pubs that focused on selling food because of the sun, although not as much as people who run houses to eat.
It seems that going out for a drink was just what people wanted to do.
Across the pubs and bars that are managed, there was a 6.6 percent increase in beverage sales for the month, while there was a three percent decrease in food."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hospitality analytics company said: "These results show a continuation of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events continue to be key factors in terms of sales in the market outside the home.
It is not surprising that eating house groups are still suffering, although a reduction of 4.8 percent a year after a year will be sure to be painful as well as constant cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for people who run food-centric homes selling food, and time and time will tell whether the more moderate temperature of August will give some of the rest it really needs."
In July, there was a 2.7 percent increase in sales in pubs and eateries, which included new ones opened. This reflected the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK catering and pub sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 action groups. They have a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and they are the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that there was an increase in "Fake Insta" pages.
The news has exacerbated concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty-one percent of students said they had a "main" account to show to parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has exacerbated concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "main" account suitable for showing to parents, while they also had some private ones.
A mother came across the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a child in her teens encouraging others to "trouble me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Mayors (HMC) of independent schools, has found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's worrying that so many children in their teens are being tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board.
At the governing body's annual general meeting, Doyle has been elected to be on the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those leading the field to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at the international level over the last decade.
"There is great respect for Eilid across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from having him on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the game in Scotland."
The American won the 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his other four Olympic gold medals, and he is now a regular on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a pool of temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I am improving or to what extent I am improving.
It's been a killing but I've completely improved, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing weightlifting exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is a wide range of online opinions about pump advertising that compares mothers to cattle
A variety of opinions online is the result of an advertisement by a pump company that almost compares mothers who feed on cattle are being bribed.
To mark the launch of what's known as the "world's first near-silent pump that can be worn first," tech goods company Elvie has released a cellular ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
There are four real mothers dancing in a sheep and cattle shed in it, to a track that contains words such as: "Yes, I'm hugging myself, but you don't see a tail" and "Fear not you noticed, these are not purses, but gifts."
The box goes on to say, "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding the baby, pump out, pump out, I'm covering the bubble."
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a hot topic online.
With 77,000 people watching the video and hundreds commenting, it has received mixed responses from viewers, with some saying it doesn't convey the dairy industry's "shame" seriously.
"It's a very bad decision when using cattle to advertise this product."
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie's pump almost fits neatly and visually inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mom)
Another said: "It is understandable that this is a tragedy for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a pump almost to mothers who are being kept their babies?"
Another added: "An ad that doesn't understand the world that it belongs to."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "overwhelmingly hilarious."
"This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I was still eating from the front.
The smell made me feel like I was in a bubble.
The ad is a bit hurtful but I took it for what it was.
"It's a great book," one wrote.
Another said: "This is a fun-filled ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or dolls) and feel like 'fourteen'.
"It's not enough to praise or judge the milk industry that the advertisement is."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump from the breast feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, does not have wires or tubes and it fits neatly inside a nursing bra. This gives the girls the freedom to move, to handle in their babies, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Executive Director of Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and concise launch.
By showing a similarity between the pruning and the pruning cattle we wanted to draw attention to the pruning pump and all its challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a fun and relevant way.
This isn't the first time Elaine has come to the fore.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the stage to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Mobile Children Moved Quietly to a Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children who are being held from fleeing has risen sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much. This is partly because the rigid rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been self-immigrants with no right to be in the country, and they have been concerned about jeopardising their right to stay in the country as they move forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that sponsors and other adults in the house would be expected to have to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency official, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of the same house as sponsors, live in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign offenders.
So we're still going after those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being retained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously customary, according to asylum workers.
Many of them will appear by video-conference call, rather than in person, in order to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered to be ineligible for assistance will be sent out of the country without age.
According to shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in recent months, the longer children stay in detention the more likely they are to feel anxious or low-spirited. This can lead to violent bullying or trying to escape.
Advocates say such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are battling.
Syria tells ‘settled moons’ from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, excused from fighting against terrorism, and will "deal with them appropriately."
"They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleared all the territories of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers who have invaded the country that has been destroyed by war.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed "a number of Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that encouraged refugees to keep up.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process for them to return," he said.
"They have made a very humane issue a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a clustering zone in the last important rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
As a result of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it was possible to avoid a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "permanent time limits" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which will "get them banned."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee, saying the panel's work would be "revising the existing articles of the constitution," and warned them not to interfere.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
If accepted, Mr. Trump could be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberators hope for sure, a high-profile and scandalous impeachment will soon end his presidency.
And that would, without a doubt, be the "most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak-hour viewers, which has grown from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, the program runner for the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," referring to a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the capital's destruction attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's fun in the middle of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, which can bring families who have immigrated back together, and the state of the wider world economy.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you realize you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of Washington experts argue about Bob Woodward's use of the words "intense background" as he tracks information for his book "Man," the short-haired jacket worn by Paul's ex-husband.
I wouldn't be able to watch Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's a reality show is that it feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the characters of Trump's show being filmed and played daily in the background.
You can't afford to miss a chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on Kauai's north beach, but he'd been lurking inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh on the verge of facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the vanguard.
"I remember when we were doing all the crazy programs there for a long time and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end for the West's salvation,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but the truth is that they're right."

Money from the outside flows into the mid-term electoral races in the House
It's no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania region is receiving a flood of money, thanks to the reshaping of congressional regions that means two contenders are in the race for the same seat.
The recently reconstituted Pittsburgh metropolitan region favors Democratic-leaning Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in last spring's special election.
Lamb is running against another contender, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which is quite close to the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconscionable unfairly favoured by the Republicans.
The race in the 17th new region has sparked a campaign finance battle between the main party finance branches, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a competition that received much attention in March in a special election to the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for more than a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
Politicians say that the Democrats are ahead of the game.
U.D. wonders about El Salvador's punishment for giving support to China, then withdraws
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, without much unfavourable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Myanmar until partners turned out the Trump Foundation management team.
State Department officials decided to call the heads of diplomatic missions back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent determinations to refuse recognition of Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, which included drug management, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and homicides.
As internal meetings moved forward, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting that was held last year that was considered a step forward in the Middle East.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials explained that they wanted the conference to go ahead, and so put an end to any consideration for the punishment of El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been briefed on the announcement of the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting.
And the three messengers returned from America quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new difficult messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the dispute described by the three U.S. officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to talk about the internal discussions on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on the condition that he was unknown to us.

It is possible that the next major event will be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump has obstructed justice, where there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller's report also reportedly discusses what Mr Trump's campaign planned with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability for that body, and he will prepare to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers in the long run and late.
There's a lot of uncertainty in that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that need to be made by all of us on either side of the Atlantic that will have an impact along the way.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We lost the opportunity, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years that had passed.
The course of history revolves around such points of formation, and the unbridled journey of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are facing a lot of these formative points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who manages Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has never been in deep waters since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and theorizing that he was unfit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the investigation the F.B.I. just asked of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
First of all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections in favor of Congress holding Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
A Jew from Czechoslovakia was my mother who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was at once occupying my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table that showed the swastika.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be hopeful for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team loyally before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians, following the equal game in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means they are in a good position to qualify from the European League Group G.
His knee injury meant that Graham Dorrans could not play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to accomplish great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
We started the game thinking that we could have something and we came away with a point.
We might have won in the end but, on the whole, an even game was a fair result more than likely.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday night, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game. But, with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there is a nice feeling in the place now.
The crew is good and the boys are enjoying themselves tremendously; the exercises are good.
Hopefully we can catch up now, forgetting about the last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep because of this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of how they wanted to get care, only a few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to get that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't let them know about your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how care is taken, because those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you think about how to pay those costs as well.
Your choices in terms of long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-for-money life insurance policy in order to pay for those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Take a look at your legal documents: Stop legal battles.
Make sure that you have a health care broker so that you appoint an individual you trust to oversee your medical care to make sure that professional workers comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Also, you should consider the authority for your financial matters.
You would choose an individual you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you can do so.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the health and safety issues?
Write those details in a written plan so that you're ready.
It's about more than financial issues, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?"
Who's going to take care of the dog?

A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers have described the shooting, which took place at around 02.30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With links being cut, rescue officials have not been able to obtain any information from the visibility of Donggala, an area in north Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have had to migrate after the earthquake hit.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi Central Province, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the Sulawesi Island, with a population target of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a prelude that extends over more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The prefecture, an administrative area under a province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic operators of the Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the other side of the island's coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Seismic Ring of Fire of the Pacific and is hit by earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck off the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A devastating Pidie Jaya earthquake struck in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people were reminded of the devastating earthquake and dangerous tsunami in 2004.
The tsunami was not caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded there temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting domestic violence reporting and denying the arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when he recognized a woman he was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone away from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Treatment Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 fund, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "decent, definitely" when asked where he was, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with Class B misconduct, which carries a day's sentence in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, assault on reporting the crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her husband told her that he had given her a hug.
Sarah Pilan was criticized by ex-military groups in 2016 after linking her son's dangerous behavior to PTSD that stems from her time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: cans are killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the Sulawesi district, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the most severe punishment for the man suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the ultimate punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rental trick by Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Midlands in Lower Manhattan, hitting the pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the maximum penalty, the pursuers will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight individuals "intentionally" and caused serious physical injuries "intentionally", according to the warning of intent to seek the maximum penalty, which has been filed.
Both of these courts are able to impose the maximum penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in order to defraud, charges that are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a conviction of felony.
Prosecutors said the attack required "significant defiance and planning", describing Saipov's attack as "fierce, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnuda's med."
Five of the victims were tourists from the Argentinian.
A decade has passed since New York's Southern District introduced the maximum penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was immediately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the sentence was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of plotting to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both of them were put to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who hails from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked to have an ISIS flag in his room at the hospital, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the ultimate punishment rather than receiving life sentences without the possibility of being released simply extends the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had already asked the pursuers not to seek the ultimate punishment.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to ‘act at the voice of the people’ today during a protest at the Dorian conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ from Eurosceptic members – as one of Theresa May’s MPs herself suggested should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
At the Birmingham rally, Peter Bone, one of the Conservative members of the back benches, said the UK would ‘go out’ now if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces when she re-establishes her highly divided ranks is based on Dorians who are in favour of Aros joining another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep up with his Chequers scheme amid attacks by people who are in favour of Brexit, people who are in favour of Aros and the European Union.
Coalitions have insisted that she will continue to try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the delay - forcing Eurosceptic and Labour members to choose between her package and a ‘no-show’.
Mr Bone said in the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘throw Chequers’.
He suggested that he should have made Mr Farage a lord and given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If it had been responsible, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand in favour of Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.’
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone disregarded suggestions that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.’
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory member in favour of Brexit, was also at the rally and told reporters: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular with the public, the Opposition is not going to vote in favour of the scheme, it is unpopular with our party and our active members who walk the streets to elect us in the first place.
Don't go to the polls and start listening to them."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
"We are acting on the voice of the people of the country who have secured a victory for us in terms of Brexit and we will continue to do so until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, people in favour of Staying through Birmingham accompanied before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A handful of Tory activists waved the Tories' flags against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
One of the Labour lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives' head because of the security issues they encountered with the party's app as the conference opened.
“There are those who tell us that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for trouble-free borders, for free borderless trade in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a complete mess.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is serious about applying for the post of President
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators, says she will "look closely at her bid to be president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe says the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly criticizes Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a state representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-chaired the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
There has been a lot of speculation that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she was meeting voters for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
She asked someone who was present whether she intended to stand for the post of president.
Warren said it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a girl on top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested Tyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET news conference at 11am.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man to be seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the South University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died immediately as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the police chiefs, told the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being on the scene, possessing a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and placed in custody in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot 6-inch young boy who grew up in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 opponents of the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team's order to help him win the front on Sebastian Vettel
It became apparent after Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team order would play a major part in the race.
From the post, Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two runs and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pool allowing Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been inevitable.
The Mercedes later went into the lap pool coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, unsatisfied, leaving the inside free to go after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he continued in his career to try to finish quickly and pass to Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
Eventually he came to the holes on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and was a generous man letting me pass.
The team has done a great job of getting one," Hamilton said.
That's a good body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Sen. Dianne Feinstein's head in a rally on Saturday for her torturing her that she did not share the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in North Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "bitter and mean and a liar."
The same thing that could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senedd, when you see the anger, when you see people who hate and are evil and are liars," he said.
"When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, over.
I didn't share the document."
Well, hold on a minute.
"We didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it, we didn't do it," he added.
Feinstein's letter included details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential and I did so as she had asked."
But the president didn't seem to believe him, and he paid attention during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you something, his body language was very poor.
She may not have, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's nomination, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three daughters, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to their own ends.
"They're determined to take the power back by any means necessary.
"You see the hate, the malaise, they don't care who they're hurting, who they've got to shake them up to get power and control," he said.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made a big loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won early on as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team's score before Dwyer regained the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard leveled the score for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams met this season, with the Giants beating the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide an even Cownie goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won first in the break as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard ensured they had an equal score with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee first in the game late in the second period and secured the win by scoring his team's fifth goal half way through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Can't on Plane Escape from Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people rises from the ground safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are stuck in a bubble in the city of Palu.
But although his co-workers have fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old boy, refused to leave his job at the extremely cryptic control tower in Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the flight at the time, was able to lift safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"It's heartbreaking to hear the news," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster-relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number is likely to continue to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and many bodies we have not yet reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached six meters have disrupted Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft come with support and supplies. . . .
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are taking away from the small supermarkets in every place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already dire, but it could get much worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to movement and transport.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok which caused 550 deaths.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that flew a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a man travelling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land in the Chuuk Island airfield.
Officials say seven people have been taken to a hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane was over the course of the flight.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a good thing," Jayne said.
Jaynes said he and other people had been able to walk through the water to their center to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said the plane's staff were agitating and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby kei and had helped save people by using a windboat to transport people to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane accidents registered with PNG in the last two decades but none of them included Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution filed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as a specialist witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis with Chambers on the night she died, going against her previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, saying he was not in town that day.
When the pursuers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's arms that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my arm was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He took his life," Hale said.
The defenseman will begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the judge later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Friesland, claims that hip hop has moved from its roots, which is political messaging and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other person?!
Nani from New York is pursuing a couple for his dismissal following a "hello" text message
Nani in New York is pursuing a couple for discrimination against her and dismissing her after she got a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she is "another black person."
The couple denies that they are gay, saying that the situation is as if someone is "trying to profit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she saw that childcare provider Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
Noting her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unfortunate," fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their old African-American grandmother had done a terrible job and that she was rather expecting Flippino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation because she was fired, and she's trying to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she's been hired to do initially, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing things like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is a case of discrimination."
The couple have criticized the claims as being racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they could not trust her after she got angry.
"My wife sent me something she didn't think she'd say.
She's not Hilarious.
We're not gay people," the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been unfair to, even if that was a mistake?
Your new-born baby?
I don't think."
Comparing the legal case to "a situation of someone trying to benefit," Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby after two weeks and she was in "a very difficult situation".
Are you going to follow someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still going ahead, it was a long time before the public court convicted the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to step into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
Now, it's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She said her father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a ten-year-old bear, would have received the same if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the books were published "feels like a nightmare."
She said her father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success quietly, describing the bear as "a very important member of the family".
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he's considering Paddington's success in that way.
Although his creation and his imagination was the work, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked desperately to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that things were very bad, and she wasn't expected to come through," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating were beginning to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died a little before that and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
A long time later, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her experience.
"Nobody knew," he said.
I kept my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two girls who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and had an infectious smile.
"Everyone remembers his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that that will have an impact again."
Ms Davis drew up the cards, "to let people know that there are people who can go to them and talk to them, even if they're friends.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, and she lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or low or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom one Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he made no eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said his death had been a huge shock to them, but they had to come through: "It's tearing a hole through my family.
It's breaking us into pieces.
We all have to fight and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins to investigate
"I thought, if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, a limited investigation in terms of scope - maybe we could secure a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee's "collapse" of scrutiny.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its meaning is related to timing.
Only five weeks to go until the mid-term elections, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the F.B.I. releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senedd, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee numbers 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Jim Jong-un came into force seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's unification administration, said there were 1,127 cases of escape last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tougher processes to control the borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates that people smugglers are raising are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the people who are fleeing North Korea will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country it is easier to cross than the highly protected IDP between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and it often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between North and South - which is still technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the declaratory discussions that had come to a halt.
This came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a heated discussion about working towards the elimination of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally exterminate ourselves at all," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'absolute', saying he's unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "absolutely" saying he was not fit, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribal Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called it 'absolute'," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and teasing at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were "destroying his good name in a consistent and opposing way" and that was organized by liberators who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's evidence proves he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows that it's inconsistent with those statements and the way Clinton supporters and the Democrats blamed it," he said.
Pelosi was asked if she would try to be confirmed, and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court or in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals for D.C.
Pelosi said she as a Democrat is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible cases against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This isn’t the time to have someone who is unreasonable and prejudiced in court waiting for us to say, ‘Are you that great?’” said Pelosi.
And girls need to talk about it.
It's a fair conversation, months and years of collusion accumulate, and it can't be removed without crying.
"We cry when we're mad," Ms. Steinem told her 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, but she's developed a technique and so, when she gets mad and starts crying, I'll tell her about it, you'll tell her who's complaining about it."
I'm sick of it."
And then she'll carry on.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to anger in part because they are, in essence, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were the most in it, and I cried out with bitterness beyond words, is an older woman holding me in the arms of my pillow - a cold manager who was always apprehensive of crying and screaming at me.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're a coward.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they've hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a carnage outside of a marriage to a man named Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very upset, realized that there was no reason she shouldn't think about applying for the post of chairman.
"I didn't think about the decision right," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another one.
They called us "The Seven Deadly Sins" and "The Seven Deadly Sins."
Because she was late in the campaign, she was on her way in terms of raising money, so she promised she wouldn't take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a terrible battle.
She noticed that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she announced her speech that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings became too much for her - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than the voters and critics, rather than the critics.
"You'd think my nerves were broken," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my embodied patron.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be in favor of Beijing
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war were enough to crush someone, and although the battle is not over, a gap between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new revenues affecting the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of items, taxing, for all intents and purposes, half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid back the money every time and, most recently, it has set tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match U.S. efforts and the world's largest economy is only one likely to give up soon.
Getting Washington to give up on it means surrendering to the demands, but publicly criticizing the U.S. would raise far too much shame on Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say if Beijing can get around it properly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies depend less on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic panic in both Asia is, in fact, much more dangerous than what viewers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace's narrator Abigail.
Syria 'ready' to accept asylum-seekers back, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to accept asylum seekers back voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to renovate the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions are right now for the reception of asylum seekers back to the country after having to flee from terrorism and the harmful economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There is a need for humanitarian aid for the six million people still living in the country.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive aid with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil, and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as the team of Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult tournament, but when the ball landed the star of the USA in the water on the 16th par-3 hole he had to give up the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, had starred in every round, becoming 1 of 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked down 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top scorer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who was more than likely playing in his last Ryder Cup.
And playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not one to cry as usual, but I can't help that today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so thankful for Thomas for my appointment and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said through his tears after Europe won.
He handed the baton to his compatriot John Ram and beat U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods as I grew up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old boy.
Woods lost every one of his four games in France, meaning that his record now in the Ryder Cup was 13-21-3.
And that's a strange statistic for one of the best players ever as he's won 14 championships in his career, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, the U.S. team had struggled throughout the weekend to find the clear way.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of this team, they fought hard.
We were in Europe in the early hours of the morning.
We did fight.
You have to pay tribute to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move on.
I love my 12 players and am proud to be a captain on them.
You have to raise your head to them.
"They played better than us."
