Inflation, in Europe, has skidded on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that falling interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "it is necessary to deter" inflation so as not to have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The futures market for cereals has increased by 88 percent and the soybean price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost nearly $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Reportedly Reported a Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance des jeunes démocrats) has increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Institut de polle) has never seen such low socialist support, namely 13 per cent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the faithful voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly severe has never been higher, it rises to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of the past spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population anticipates an aggravation and only a tenth anticipates an improvement in the situation.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather poorly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny while 38 percent support Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without changing government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent of those polled wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, the current rate is only 20 percent, and the relative majority (33 percent) believes that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be no doubt.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospitalization fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospitalization fees, respectively.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, although this year the VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, a value increase well above a thousand forints being displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, “which had already soared” in grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items bought well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this figure was 6,800 forints.)
Prices of Unicum and live fish remained close to last year's level, however prices of turkey net, walnut and poppy have risen sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed data from the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, we found bread from one kilo to only 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints per bottle.
Only this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest one of last year and the most expensive one of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has puzzled trade, with hypermarkets unable to visibly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was higher than the value of 1 720 forints in 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was higher by 1,630 forints than last year and the cheapest prices increased by 1,284 forints as well.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics found a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already well-priced last year, has increased by barely more than 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, the flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than the egg suppliers because they have managed to get the brutal increase in prices also accepted by the multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-preserved foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many Hospitals Are Saving on Disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by improper use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overcrowding of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the chief physician of the National Centre of Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants.
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The victim of a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do a major operation on him because of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, chief physician at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
That is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicemia, on the elderly, patients with low weight or with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, we should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only where we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances are not favorable, in Hungarian hospitals, to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
As this infection is manifested mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only occur if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the chief physician of the epidemiology center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and basic care, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
Many Hospitals Are Saving on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, patients should be away from each other by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save money on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is lower demonstrably or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not in a state of intoxication
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement was made.
It can be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunkenness or stupor, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the public ministry of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station in the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd arrondissement.
(By the way, the fact that he crossed the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of conducting the investigation.
Additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million credit line agreements in Budapest on Friday to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties with a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft Metro Line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would reconsider the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a haven for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular destination in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also more and more numerous to buy in the very cheap corner of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, with retail and office space promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea coast and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving a medium- or long-term gain.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly increasing due to an increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the communication of G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, they did not want to discuss exact figures, although they were ready to sign an agreement on reducing, by 2020, greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent compared to the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries, apart from reducing emissions, are committed to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) has announced.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its role as an admiral ship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the “After 2012 Agreement”, and was ready to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to take their adaptations.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol had been aiming for a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and that the total of the 15 EU members at that time had made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, the press release of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
The issue is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within the two-year timeframe that the new UN treaty will get, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values provided in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international reduction system.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
On the video-sharing site, units of the British Army communicate recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan have been uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is essential
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as Defence Headquarters in the spring of 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (IMF) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make known to the general public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by this channel costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements passed on television, according to a statement to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is bothered because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the fighting side.
In fact, many videos had already been posted showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has been packing up to upload these videos only recently.
Americans do the recruiting a little differently using the free downloadable America's Army shooting game. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tumbola and donuts in ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so enjoy the power.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year’s biggest Christmas party will be hosted by the Department of Defense, but it’s not the department’s employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The department has a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM celebration will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected to attend.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NF<0xC3><0x9C> Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
Renting the room costs one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Center for Economic Development, the company managing tenders.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C> but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, hosted a ball on St. Luke's Day on December 7.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the evening dress was not at all mandatory at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her co-workers to a Christmas party, but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall, which 436 employees are expected to attend.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees have celebrated Christmas in the same way every year.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, held every year, start with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have informed [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are coming together
The trade unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The League Unions will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health insurance, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health insurance will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike planned for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report going on strike for an indefinite period of time, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railways Union (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Union of Teachers and the Union of Democratic Teachers will strike for two hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Health and Social Sector Employees' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the pension to be put in place from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to pass into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Union Libre des Cheminots (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railways and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the country's risk
According to the Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the worsening of the ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to provoke this situation.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of the Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is exacerbated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, as a result of increased publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian right-wing radical and extreme groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 under the name of "National Association of Self-Defense".
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, law enforcement), armed if necessary, moreover, evoking the ineptitude of the police, the army,” they added.
They reported that everything was going according to the method that, based on the rancor of the political and party society, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil point of view.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of the registration of these associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighboring relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous riots of Roma that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to constitute a guard saying that the goal of the organization is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the constitution of their own guard as a resistance signalled the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, can be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director at Political Capital, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of the holiday and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so so that the alarm clocks can rest quietly.
In addition, in a year, we have a total of eleven holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is also the day commemorating the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is the Labor Day and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been making special regulations for days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not apply, however, to service societies, to institutions that are constantly in service, by their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences most people do rather overtime or take holidays that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the level of working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can horribly annoy colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these troubles or whether we rise to the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
Did you miss an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool, or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Do you remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking or they're right to be angry at you for stinging their good.
Do not bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and that you need it right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop potions from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares their intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse their trust!
Bury the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you declaring yourself sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or you feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you are not going to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to warn your boss and colleagues to prevent them from being surprised by your absence the next day.
Chilling, tingling, phone
You get into your job, but your co-workers' squeezing pulls you out of it?
Did you become, unintentionally, witness a conversation over the phone that you would have done better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with shouting, chanting, talking out loud (which you’re leading over their heads), kicking, big words, or loud voiced discontent.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, do not blame anyone for this forgetfulness!
Do not put it on the account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented disadvantages for others, correct the mistake!
Ask how you could make up for your mistake, make up for the neglect!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable at the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
Slowly moving forward into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a special melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm picking up the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of the whole hour, then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it looks like the plug is going to be different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger arrived from Pécs and he himself played in the group of Yonderboi before he embarked on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k).
Early training in small clubs began to be known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 as one of the fifty most important albums on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have unquestionably become “trendy” but no one has asked them if they want to wear this label well.
The band reacted properly, they released a new and better album.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It is that it was a line of the former group of Pecs of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
We are well with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for radio, Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to night, began to introduce the songs of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
However, a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is perceived only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and had a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At the beginning, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi’s because there are many of us leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi list, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar for the first time through the track of this song.
With this more popular style have you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought there was still something missing from that song.
The set of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang at night even the melody that the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time but of course we needed Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (with the exception of a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were in the back of the scene too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader is risking billions because of his inferiority complex
A covert fraudster.
The former employee of the French giant is Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, can in no way be considered incapable.
Unlike all the major banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, denouncing him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions generated a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is surpassing the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called “sub-prime” mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” says Kerviel, adding that he has, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to falsifying the reports so as not to be traced.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Those who risk nothing have nothing.
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought the simple fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He only got to his position gradually.
He started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university degree and my professional and personal career," Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he won his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
“As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes.”
This is when the start of the year comes.
He lost a billion dollars in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros due to him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion kroner under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage an amount of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should be provided with financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of a $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion) fraud.
However, he was later released and lived as a resident in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be re-imprisoned is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let the German finish his sentence at home, or else go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious societies and the accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest supporters.
Part of that money went to the funds that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n had created to fund his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget was adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, every chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The quarrels of politicians are much more interested in opinion than in abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of settling at once:
The first being the significant share of mandate fees imposed by the law, constituted not only by pensions, but also by social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" comprising the parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest anomaly.
This one is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in stalemate, over-indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they were able to repay these debts by mass selling the shares of the distribution systems, including those of energy, obtained from the State as part of privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If only official and verifiable facts are taken into account, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not without expectations.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls mainly on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, on a global scale, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately been unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been eliminated, if there is no change in the age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system in the near future, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only manage.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes the regular costs to be pushed back by the mandate costs.
The projected $70 billion deficit for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not wasted all the money they could.
If we really do not want to see the politicians in power become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
It is only the latter that will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight together the crisis of the financial markets.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be placed in the money markets through auctions.
It will be for the banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
As an example, the US Fed will auction off $40 billion and provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take action on this concerted point, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
“This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” writes Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to non-repayable loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more losses in the billions.
“If the central banks have chosen this approach, it’s that they have to really understand what can still happen,” said Amro Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market, was not brought down.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the US, Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by the central banks will help to ward off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be especially detrimental to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time came down on the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference that there is between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz of solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in the German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested persons can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of this climate are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they are therefore not ineffectual, they represent no end in danger and no cost.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous encroachment on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against an integralist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in a position to issue them with a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid permits will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, the authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has increased this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2000 customers per day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request the delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driver's license by the end of the year and take the road without a valid license will be subject to a fine starting in January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by taking an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine increases to 2500 kroner.
According to ancient information, even a person who would not circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his opinion, a document that people can decide if they want to have it or not.
It is not as with the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
It is sufficient to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons holding documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime risked sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting only the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials of more than 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people for participating in hold-ups, with the Superior Court today dealing with appeals from 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the accusation by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych, among other things, transmitted to the criminals information from police sources, covered the various hold-ups and helped the gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies of which the victims have, in most cases, suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a sighter for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a whole series of other people for other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has so far avoided Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej who are currently living in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: $12 million
The lawyer of the families of the victims Igor Veleba wants to get from the hospital of T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, this one is very very high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said at the exit of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report whose drafting was commissioned by the opposing party.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonov's family demanded one million crowns for each month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, although they were confronted with the remorse of not being able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they, remain less serene in the face of the experience of the trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening right now, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola from <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika from Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablonov.
At the end of October, the Governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina region, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by the Civil Liability Insurance Act.
In case of failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
So far, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated on the basis of the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Shelf and loss of the Kingdom of Wallachia (with the Kingdom of Wallachia)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka a perdu le litige au sujet de la marque of the Kingdom of Wallachia (Kingdom of Wallachia).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was actually he who had used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There’s almost a decade of work behind us.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kr<0xC3><0xA1>l (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> had crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, it had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD> passports appear.
From a humorous action originally came a lucrative business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders balances on the price of the visit to his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the show mane<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the project of the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kr<0xC3><0xA1>nivst<0xC3><0xAD>," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, requesting that the court today rejected it.
What could clear the case is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
He should bring out a new king.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>cko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of speed, of the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be classified as below average.
Now, there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is much better.
All the more so as the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining about, for example, headroom in the rear seats.
While there finished the complaints because the body combi means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see what's done
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems to me poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about seats or files too short is over.
The lateral guidance has also significantly improved compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is noticeable there as well.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to rate this as very accessible (also thanks to the swivel back ice) and a rather easy climb.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let’s stop at volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlada Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the case remaining after the roll-over of the backrests of the seats perfectly straight, or a very low walk.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that’s what a 1.6 should look like, which makes a family hatchback walk.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot blocked by a coil, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine amounting to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition, we have airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> at the end of the account.
This is a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia additional equipment and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which is causing concern among the rest of the population about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have even seen cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the natives turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where the conflict between Slovak-born immigrants and Slovak-born immigrants is beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, chicane and fights between the students have transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far that police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The defendant defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist words.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the survivors went so far as to qualify the conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and place of transhipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana’s Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Nacional hotel, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have long since, in such a salty and wet climate, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had come back from the plantations spread in the sweet shops on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how you can see on the go small locomotives whose contemporaries are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on a limestone soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons, and rocks rise in candlesticks from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile earth caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetal carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market of the slave trade and that of sugar that have brought it glory and wealth.
The wealth has been embodied in the beauty and character of the city-window of this small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed over the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massif Escambray, is a place so far apart that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth going to see also interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Valley of Sweets.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which is animated after sunset and where the music is deafening only in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed Cuba’s eastern shelf, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage list.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey to Columbus) and from the hill where the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several mountains table, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
On the subject of coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, a page full of all this could be filled.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say U.S.
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, influences the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, the representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved today also discuss future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the U.S. this week called through Defense Minister Robert Gates for NATO troops to greater activity, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the intensification of development aid.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, to 60 percent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that lasted three days.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts among the countries involved in the issue of whether all the allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called the German soldiers lazy this week.
“Afghan idlers discovered: Germans play while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on the counter-attack by posting the photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is on each Czech Republic.
Total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget savings, the ministry has reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
During the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state's debt dating back to early October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech Republic.
During the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border by a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Picor’s prediction is similar: “We could exceed a trillion by the end of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene is changing, that politicians are ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The state’s external debt has so far increased this year from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The debt of the state called negotiable reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt requirement for the state was 6.5 years.
“Total debt has increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a much too high figure.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by the bonds where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It follows from the government's strategy of financing and managing the state's debt for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected change in the economy of the state budget, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
Next, these are the maximum sources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for 43 billion crowns and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion crowns.
She appeared today in court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a whipping penalty.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asked her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the children’s mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend “My name is Mohamed”.
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he said.
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Recall that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the province’s future status at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake”, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We don’t foresee any immediate violence but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with re-mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, the West believes that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not act in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, at the Baden hotel where the “negotiations of the last chance” had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that led to killings and deportations".
The Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says it fears a “domino effect” in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
“The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made "in consultation" with Westerners.
Bush pulls out agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “road map” for peace they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues.”
This designation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and deal with all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and ongoing" and would make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set a deadline at the end of 2008 for his “vision of two co-existing Palestinian and Israeli states” to be implemented.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-language daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in every time in this type of diverse fact, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She wasn’t in intervention but on patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle from the Kawazaki brand, “unapproved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating “at a very fast pace”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right,” one police officer said.
The control of blood alcohol on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (previously smashed, star-studded windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to people in danger" to the IGPN, co-chaired with the departmental direction of public safety of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specified that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled for as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have left the scene very quickly, thus not lending help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out “any serious fault” with regard to this point.
“This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, which you have to be very careful about,” a police source said.
Liberation met with an eyewitness of those few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows overlooking the stage.
“We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagard policeman, who was barking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youths, the fourth was talking on the phone.
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the police officers left”.
They also performed heart massages in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was imposed two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency measures have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter retaliated by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court Bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reportedly held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyers’ movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and detritus to those who have sworn an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday night.
It was to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential, on October 6, by indirect vote, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army and become a civilian president “no longer holds” after the state of emergency was established, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) are still unplanned, according to a study conducted by the Institut national d’études démographiques (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for better "fecundity control", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Perhaps calculated in the near month for a couple out of five and if possible in the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station’s continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "crafted" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylindrical piece tasked with soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking station for the modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a 17.5-tonne solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, in order to position it at its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go shelling at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore tasked with “operating” the “wounded” solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of "strip" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the sas and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulator to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and “crafted” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts did not return the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS stock is currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating profit forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to offset the delay in delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further clarifications.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days after the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sent a televised message to voters on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the United Russia list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory promises to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not reveal anything about receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections with no strings attached,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from it.
It is a campaign fraught with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have been “never so dirty elections, even in the time of Yeltsin.”
After the crackdown on last weekend’s protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
<0xC2><0xAB> The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus »
Behind these suspenseless legislations are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot fight for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and at all powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both in the legislature and in the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel themselves masters of their fate,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society has lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has lagged behind the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “voluntarily renounce personal responsibility” which they had briefly demonstrated after the breakup of the USSR.
“What good to think about?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54 years old teacher: "What good to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were up to now only available for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his rightholders.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States having been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nomination documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find the civilians deported or subjected to forced labour and, possibly, to provide them with evidence of their detention, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Centre on Antisemitism at the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly 60 billion years.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade agreement greatly undermines both economies” and “India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or the second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants still trade each other annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission to the European Parliament.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was concerned to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual offer.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve intake during the maintenance period beginning on December 6th in a format that is consistent with the Bank's forecast for the next five years," the Bank said in a statement.
The bank says that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time that the BoE appears to be putting five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it “stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates” of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, a higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the money placed on the market by the Bank of England was accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the book against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favorable rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC reject consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text rejected about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition within a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the entirety of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming
Following many rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event-festival.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become entangled in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and are preparing to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, after making a name for itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban settings.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both a country festival impression to European and urban American."
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity to host this festival is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations were issued to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to the press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavoured, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it.
This mission of seduction is part of the duties of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the legs of the “Governor”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals of the West Coast, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be a matter of presenting the Quebec movies, highlighting them and making sure that the directors make interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be screened at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year on the stock market? The experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks after the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are looking at the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of short-term leaks into securities".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuanced that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new highs.
Intermoney’s Solana says “this year the big values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, said the increase will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months now and we hope that other manufacturers like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," he said.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do very well as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month for only two occasions.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the technology bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds by computer on its rally at the end of the year.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the brand Populaire Max, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening one afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for whether or not other organizations adhere to this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely the objective sought by the People's Bank.
Attract self-employed customers in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, head of commercial banking, said the renovation does not involve large investments, but hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Madrid's Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff external to the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco CEO, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
There was only one aspect to his joy: ‘what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have decreased less,’ he said.
However, he emphasized that in a low market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed on the stock exchange amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while the net revenues of television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to Telecinco's best relative evolution on the stock market is the important pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the 33% purchase of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
“We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with Endemol’s 33%.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to a decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which came into force on November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the agencies so that the markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided for specialized social reasons as well as to individuals or legal entities and creates a new type of financial advisory services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which face competition from current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose to the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
In passing through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, one of which highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management has taken advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices increased by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on December 14.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less of a surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," the economy minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42,000 million over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to over 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the Government's 100% guarantee of this money, which it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the goal of 30,000 million.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) per year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association’s offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (People's Party) early this morning because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the municipal council's secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May’s former right-wing MP Juan Morales, who until then had been the city councillor of the town hall, and who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the “manager” of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the City Council and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As indicated yesterday by the Chaine SER to the lawyer of the member of the 'people's party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the purpose of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
So far, eight people have been detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s bid for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the election
Former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the secretary of organization of the Spanish socialist party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will chair the Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic context.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that even if citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish socialist party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he gets the job, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "dominion".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is ruthlessly persecuting both the skeptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is the president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors it occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences this will cause.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where many officers were meeting at the time, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal enterprise of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after paying illegal commissions during the last period.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana's No. 1 Tribunal is investigating.
The first six inmates have now been transferred to a court order.
According to sources, Totana's former municipal councillor and currently an independent parliamentary member of the PP, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Group of Urban Offences of the Central Operative Unit (UCU) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Tot.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, which may have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday’s commentary published in Finland’s most important newspaper (certain top PISA news above the educational level in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the book’s critique:
"The content of the Philosophy course challenged public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Advisor, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato about what is written in the pages of the Helsingin daily Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.”

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of crimes on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store with a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. The theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than that imposed for the download (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
In the end, if my colleague is in the real one then someone exaggerates.

My attending physician told me of one of his articles on strange research entitled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is to say, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed they were getting the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and puts pressure on the governments involved.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible damages, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And that is that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the odds.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower casualty rate due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tended to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of drawbacks when signing an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as the low experience in driving and seniority of the driver's license.
While the ideal way to be well insured is to take out insurance at any risk, there are other, more economical options.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for free-of-charge all-risk insurance, so that they get the coverage of all-risk insurance at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount will be," said Luis Noguera, First Europa's head of online insurance in Spain.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, try to be careful and avoid damages as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase in the basic tariff.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera explains.
Beyond the age of 25, this becomes easier for drivers when signing a contract with insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose any risk insurance with franchise.
“Normally young people cannot enjoy the experience previously gained after an accident,” says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with deductibles (can be 300 euros), or third-party insurance extended from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have more casual driving and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” Noguera said.
For retirees, any risk insurance with deductibles is preferable (being 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us the most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow will compete next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified on the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC are scheduled to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the final eights.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game returns to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hope to qualify for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal by Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would return only to Shakhtar, in case Celtic would lose, to qualify for the eighth final to be able to continue the league of champions of UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their gig at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people have used up the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s is told.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that picks up their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show".
Sporty Spice, who was part of the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five or seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will be on display in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is raising the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risks of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s owned monopoly company supplying gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would raise its prices as planned to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would entail for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom’s supplies to Ukraine.
This led to the drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health "must control its foreign employees".
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-community employees to check if they have criminal precedents, the monitoring committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health did not have any specific data on the number of overseas employees.
His report nonetheless highlighted other critical controls, which were properly performed on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor in the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep, in the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October as he was suspected of being involved in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on previous criminal records, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of the UK.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Records Control, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
“Although we have found that certain information regarding staff has been verified, this is not done every time,” the report states.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff members is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings could bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities have said they employ 1,161 people overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, in part because of the problems of identifying staff with fixed-term contracts, who might or might not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas staff in the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
She added that the Scottish Government, allied to the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better execution of the recently updated pre-employment controls, which are valid for all employees, including overseas employees.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio-pic on Joy Division's latest singer, Ian Curts, has garnered 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench Named Best Actress for Her Role in ‘Notes on a Scandal’
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for allowing British film to be under international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, whose soundtrack was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just $3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, has won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best director starting.
Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his portrayals of brave characters, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British filmmaking.
The 50-year-old director, who has made films such as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of the star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the interior minister said that 18 of the arrested people belong to a cell headed by a “missile launcher expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the inmates appear to have conspired to assassinate clerics and armed forces.
The government has asked the clerics to do more against the Saudi-led Iraq, to join al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretical along the hard line of the Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, emboldened by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five... months," the interior minister's spokesman said on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 Medina members organized into a “media cell” to promote “takfiri thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the inmates, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation allied to a slower rotation has led Venus to a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate change.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium seized by police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the challenge as a presidential candidate to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions raised were as ridiculous as that from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate in the next election.
It is not known on what criteria CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear nice things: The government reported increases in approval when candidates spoke out rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegals regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to dig deeper into the subject.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they began to fight immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with concerns in particular about the toxic toys manufactured in China, or other fears of the outside world, favor Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the full content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, in a pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, would declare the death penalty painful though necessary.
When we insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said Jesus was too chic to run for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for subsidies led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling during Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party fail to agree on who is the best-known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly through a message of success about American greatness thus bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly judicious.
No sold decorations, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no sucked extra marital toe.
But here is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle Gordon Brown would have had a good time.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his election bill, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the verge of crack, has demonstrated a failure of the guidelines and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military spending: they have proclaimed that being defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (and his former head of vigilance) has made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People do not like politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any further purpose.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long-running investigation into the party’s funds for “cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr Brown is in is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party make believe.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown’s old Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collection who had talked about dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, resorting to an inquiry committee on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for the past six months, and preparing a good reform on the finances of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good lead in the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card Scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see buoyant fins, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the unrecoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
Fees and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, a tax agency, the third quarter's 3.89% insolvency rate is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and the confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of broadcasts for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair housing loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of cash than to the value of the estate, and therefore the fall in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to pay it all back.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of having a rapid resumption of actions.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of having a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America into recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify about their roles in a fraud committed by Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to the seven charges of alleged collusion fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s PLC group, have become famous across Britain due to extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, dubbed the “Natwest Three,” claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the stage director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him concoct bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest from the subsidiary's bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is jailed for three years and a month in a Texarkana prison.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting gimmicks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its canon speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in market value loss, and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were dismissed because of her death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither in nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs that many seats because it’s more of a family plane or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires’ Show, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was hosted by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all there,” said Nicole Marais, a representative for London jeweler Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare to be like their clients, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a veteran of the red carpet like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come up to a huge warehouse where are exposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and peluurs.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, proudly seated at the Royal Delf porcelain factory stand, in front of a hand-painted Raimbrant mural on blue tiles.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling”
Indeed, sellers here have stated that Russians with old capitals (10 to 15 years is too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, roam the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it wasn’t in cash,” he said.
“There’s more to it than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has erected four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with mass counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested for throwing masses of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karyev said.
Unauthorized Surgeon Suspected of Murder in New Jersey
It was the eve of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the glass bay of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, which police have not yet identified, resident at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo’s death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but which should solve this mysterious death that saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been the assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done anything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgery.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and having found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation nor even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro’s house where a faded rose rested in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and again there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates related to the effervescence of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the U.S. central bank’s pacifying vice president’s statements.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said those who decide, must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this tough turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of further financial conditions stiffening for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further declines in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil were accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a sale at the monthly three-tiered fund auctions issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a hefty rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets, causing credit tensions, have caused UK banks to have their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong rebound since November 12.
England faces an appeal for judgment against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be England’s No. 6 batter in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President and CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least on a part-time basis.
He who fails to win the number 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by lack of ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to bring Bopara out?
Is it fair compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives having obtained good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room only for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless they are given at least one chance?
Figures have their importance in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
If it is Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred scored against Australia in Australia may still be under.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start to the innings of Test 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his city of Middlesex player, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently flipped on a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his crewman who was watching him from a distance, to ask him “did he see this?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his fast pace allows him to do services that suit him, and he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the real art of selection?
I would be inclined to give his chance to Bopara, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is not committing crimes anymore!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of clerical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-backed militia allowed Al Qaeda to be driven out of the west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan's newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and at the sight of the continued formation of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” and collaborating with U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, has expressed the suspicion that Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister of Syria, has asked the Syrian government to limit the number of people allowed into the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house when I left.”
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will once again heighten sectarian tensions and bring the fighting back.
Small Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines with the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-destruction, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher secondary schools in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Thus, the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double-course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarr<0xC3><0xB3>is has forced the graduate schools to a marketing campaign in the subjects of engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the final year of kindergarten is exempt from the law - a model that meanwhile other federated states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students’ performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saar has not improved as much as other federated states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And despite Sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - you could otherwise earn points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon do tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour clock in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As reported by Venezuela's official newspaper, due to a new law, the clocks will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The leftist nationalist announced that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it, only because of my dignity,” said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on through a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The starting point of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly “crashed in the face” of Venezuela with this decision, Chavez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain also Chavez is in every mouth.
A new mobile phone ringtone is raging in the country: "Por qué no te silentas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was annoyed by the constant interrogations of left-wing populists and who told him to shut up.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a real lower value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild newspaper.
New charges may also apply in the case of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" that the planned fall in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial assistance, according to the SPD politician.
It was known on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like Earth than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirls of wind at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning strikes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today brought the proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud in the cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific journal ".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no more probes were on the way for the exploration of this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than initially assumed.
So the researchers found, in addition to the already known wind whirlwinds at the north pole, a swirl of clouds at the south pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italiana.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet qualified as an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, water has accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but has been lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler, demands an end to the parties' quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany's appearance and is summing up the grand coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the accusations that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of a single China.
“China knows that too,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "forward policy" on foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but according to Spiegel, it also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other current provinces.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be implemented so that social discontent in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, demanded the German Interior Minister.
Barricades that burn, breakers that shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also form in our country and is unleashed in violence.
We must take this seriously,” he told the “New Press” in Hanover.
Not all young individuals would be able to get away with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government are what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded.
Taking into account the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasizes that the proportion of unemployed among young people under the age of 25 from immigration would be above average.
Above all, there should be more space for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that there was more social control in families in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "But we must still be careful."
It should be "quickly given young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities in the post reported three arrests as well as some burned cars and garbage.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overflowed into Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there is nothing left to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After his deplorable intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The accusation of focusing too much on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and it just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to everyone how accurate this accusation was.
There was neither concrete interest nor little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements over and over again, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of himself - to have so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it clings to all-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
By doing so, she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional sentences for that.
In this matter, the number of times it makes lapses when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-accurate sentence.
She hesitates on unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking out on the first topic.
He reportedly made New York a “refugee for the underground,” Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The former governor of Massachusetts is accused of employing undocumented immigrants, and Giuliani responds by accusing him of using his own home as a haven for illegal immigrants.
Candidates mount the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via YouTube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have let Hitler come to power,” John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the lesson forcefully done by Vietnam’s veterans when he refuses to condemn what is called “waterboarding” as torture, an interrogation method that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented out or future tax hikes are denied, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are once again revealed.
"I made a mistake at the time," Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a flowing knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns as a civilian for the first time.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus succumbed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By removing Musharraf from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Soon after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had held after the state of emergency was established with lawyers from his ranks, rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock fathers are back.
Germany's supergroups of the 1970s replayed: the three members of the group Harmonia once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and above all their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old man in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the group Harmonia plays again has ensured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name resonates in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been sorely lacking for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always enjoyed more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the hall as interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in the pan-Gyric praise, the surprise had no limits.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory of this fact is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother briefly had trouble with Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
In the trash there was a fan of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
A lot of people keep Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band was suffering from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood did not serve alone in the search for itself.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of almost 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the realms of esotericism and ensured its existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the album Live from Griessem to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His label Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
subsidised publicly as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be defined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s sentence hovers in the room amid the singular sounds: “The only real music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of bazaar-wired tools serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the battery, to pull the instruments of unheard sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built themselves.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three of them are big tech financiers.
Even the choir of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been less sought after in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this now.
But what goes most naturally will be covered thoroughly on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can tap into the nerves of someone (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killing Peace", two films again tackle the Balkan War.
But they both don’t convince.
Either the projects are based too much on action and on the exchanges of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had lastly lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many cute and futile roles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why should today's films be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of nods: at bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins to his decline, has nevertheless kept some of his charms.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Killing Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless series of films missed about the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here Serbs are for once not presented as the sole causes of all ills, this film as flat as a telefilm gets lost far too quickly in the action and exchanges of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at bottom there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who set out to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military can’t do and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the cynical deserter with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosniak murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosniaks.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice of the Hague should be seized of the crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human preoccupation.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt in a rather intensive way because of secret political agreements.
But the good and the bad are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He talks about a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean."
Movies like “The Hunting Party” have exactly such tumbling heads, but they hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa.
Which is true every time: when a star is languishing on a crisis home or on a minefield, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler's List.
Some films have yet to mature - those that are worth classic works on Vietnam today "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have by no means been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we also know just too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delighted the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” actually became just as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn’t yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we shouldn't want to be good when we want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's takedown of Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with virulent criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Waterside Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, described an abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz calls on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday to his previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, about Munich's bid for the 2018 winter games.
This preference means for us, that in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F> said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD faction accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and ruled out housing construction," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always called for the Little Grasbrook to have an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, Germany, would have raised a lot of enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, had broken up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
He who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on the list of works by Warhol.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today results in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Museum Pontus H.
Ancient history is intertwined, a bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden cases, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, samples of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Eyewitnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol allowed, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have raised more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, wrongly, later that about a hundred wooden cases had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, that Warhol would then have sold it to him.
In truth, Hultén’s 105 crates were produced in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, Chief Curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum’s six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating from the year 1990, on the contrary, reveals that the paint was applied directly without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, so much so that Moderna Muse will collect them."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the “heavy charges” that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila are leaving.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same ones who had severed themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The loyal soldiers in power had stormed the hotel shortly before with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
About half of them were on Wednesday in front of the courts due to a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and had joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chairperson convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People are tired of it,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila's financial district was already the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke out nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured a stake of more than 20 percent from telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyout.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is said in the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed on the stock exchange 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesman said.
Both companies founded the joint-stock company MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not exercise their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
Both companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase participation in Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
Until now, United Internet and Drillisch Holding held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
