Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament has rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft cancellation of the paragraph on the indictment of Yulia Tymoshenko, the head of the opposition.
The deputies rejected at second reading the draft amendment aimed at the reduction of sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted woman in December.
Tymoshenko calls the regime’s political vendetta judgment and has provoked a process of suspicions of court bias also in the west.
The draft to repeal paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Category: Libyan victories
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined the winners.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but are they moderates or radicals?
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight you cut off your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, potential non-respecters of the faith are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
There will be such an order in Libya that we cannot represent it and certainly would not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
So when it comes to finding the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "cruises".
Without land tenure, oil companies would easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will eventually be able to boast of self-interested protection of human rights.
As little as these followers of sharia prevent us from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics has passed on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states published the GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have earlier published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better placed than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (there was a question of the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to the data planned and periodically recalculated.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on bonds over ten years is 28.45%
Yields on bonds from Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football team has achieved its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also defended with a good deal of luck in the second part of his qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech national team also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification in the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defense.
The winners of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
For the first few minutes, we played football.
Both teams found it difficult to mount combinations and the game was mainly centered around the center line.
The pressure from the national footballers did not penetrate the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
They have thus openly expressed that they will defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest report that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
There has been a report in Israel of a possible attack by Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the U.S. and Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are overweight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese women had french fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big kids sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have signed up for this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed indicated, for example, eating breakfast 5 times a day – in the case of lunch – snack – dinner, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition,” says one of the survey results.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been noted is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children consume unhealthy fries more often.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drinks sugary drinks (70%) every day.
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal, in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favorite dishes there are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a high preference for sweet lemonades," the survey found.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading towards health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not a coincidence' awareness session, there was a strong will to move towards healthy eating," the survey results say.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen next.
The presentations of three professionals in the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we get to final exams, the more practical exercises and information we can expect.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "drunk".
This time we have with director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) treated the way to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus managed to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too visibly the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not fit at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you won’t regret it because the clothing that falls flawlessly is priceless.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in the one that constantly slips, wraps and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker-style outfit, with pieces of sewn fabric, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
At the bottom of my mind, it’s a pleasure, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds in recent times (don’t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Also thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physique but creates, for example, the productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us all about it.
But that... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single outfit in a different way.
Variability is a prime example of this.
Like for example this trench coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with shoes and take it as a dress.
Or just lift up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
“Play with that,” he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contravene it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains frivolous.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to pass to the second rank).
And if someone does a styling on our part, we then have to rely on the fact that it dictates us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than the one it actually has.
It then remains for us to navigate on Google and make sure if the boulevard information states the celebrity in question, whether she has gained weight or fattened etc...
Honza and Mario put us on the heart Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not flatter themselves, to keep their opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can’t just throw it all away and say, ‘My God, what a horror.’
“You’ll find some things that you’ll find nice and him you’ll advise on what to wear them with,” Mario says.
This one showed us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to the clearly defined things such as scissors, peeling rollers or nursing pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if they are not too large or can be removed from the kite.
So that we are not just people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly look like shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The countess I'm talking about isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of classes
I am beginning to understand that doing styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is fighting across America.
Revision
Originally a hassle-free race turns into a set of stupid mistakes by people who have nothing to do with a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills to some extent the ambition of everyone but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the older Need for Speed racing series and to come out a kind of game from playable games that would not count only with points.
So we were curious how the added passages are going to be during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible faineantism on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken on the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also quite nice even if the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasing.
In addition, the tests are occasionally embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Apart from this, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a small number of them, but that is enough.
There are moments you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then again you expect another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who get into the game and try to make you the difficult situation.
The novelty is the passages outside the vehicle.
It’s more of an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (to be specific, there are only three).
The result is just like that because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at the moment there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As for the realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, collisions are not yet fully developed.
We don’t expect this game to be a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don’t have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, it’s not completely good.
During the tight overtakings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy volts.
Or it ends up in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes reboots don't help and you have to find the solution by remembering the route piece in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same actions end up in the same places.
For example, there are certain curves that you have to go through in a certain way otherwise it does not happen.
Otherwise, you will encounter "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either put yourself aside and bypass them or brake.
It does not matter if you go in front of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is most annoying at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a number of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something exciting and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it is a pity because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you do not have time to follow everything that happens.
And it does not matter if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You should pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic rides on very technical drives for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult moves to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a metro train that sends the car directly to the scrapyard.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What's bothering is that in more extreme situations, the imagery doesn't hold up and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes to hit your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will be 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envy her, she showed how she takes her motto "comprehensive and open about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, the critics echoed that he’s a fad, that he’s a roundabout, that he can’t fill any missions, and I have to say that he took everyone’s breath away because he holds his role to perfection.”
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards unity and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis states, such as China or the In.
No one wants to ban us from our sirecky (cooked dough cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that she has lived, lives and will live in a time close to the European Council.
She called the Czech presidency of two years ago a success.
The Czechs have resolved the growing financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be solved even now.
It is also necessary to approve the new seven-month budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As the budget appears to be slim and in view of savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make sirecky.
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is, according to her, the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Poles, Magyars, Slovaks come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Vicenova, in the near future it is new tough fiscal rules that await member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
In the first place it was said that countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want it remain in their corner."
“There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe,” Vicenova said.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to search for the word that expresses IBM’s strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be “the long-term.”
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a company felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will grow (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the company culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and merchants.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in discovering talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, online brainstorming from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a safe position in the field of business.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company but a company that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM – or the “Big Blue,” as it is commonly called in the United States in terms of its slogan – has grown into one of the world’s largest companies in a hundred years.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
His discoveries include, for example, the ticket dispenser, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second-largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple) with $220 billion this year, when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and the time - for example, IBM did not succeed in betting on an OS/2 operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on moving forward you can’t emotionally stay stuck on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the rival Microsoft that basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A perspective technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preponderant place.
However, back in 1990, it was with more than the motivator of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Beginning in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during which time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of perspective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating on the orders of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who also increased his investment during the Great Depression.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
IBM's stock price has grown by 120 percent since 2008, and the firm's net profit continues to grow.
The logo of IBM is to change everything but not its values.
It can be expected for this that this flexible giant will master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights into the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it was originally called the Computation Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the 80's of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then cast a shadow over the firm's founder - it was Watson's ideas that have so far shaped the company's identity and culture.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce – from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to $9 million and the firm began expanding to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management, it was his son who occupied the director's chair, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos—on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM for the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
In terms of commerce, IBM recently developed a “Smarter Commerce” platform that helps marketers manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that is responsible for speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova asylum in summer in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted on moving from Ricany after 30 days, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s bond and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, adding that she had separated from her husband but that they remained only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has put a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, like each other, are able to get them "out of their way".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that manage to pump blood from the veins of men.
The Purchases
Does your half tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and bundle at the time of sale?
In your case, we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the shop window wiper, to look for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for the man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting for you at the entrance.
Constant Dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start doing sports?"
"Are you kidding me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not a question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more women become poisonous.
Odor and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless ride.
Washing the windows, vacuuming, cleaning the floors, dusting, stripping the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, plastered the window of the living room, and that this gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer precisely from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"But this worn-out overclothing in the trash."
"Are you going to put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this sap work on your partner in this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persipation, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly drawn to relationships and thus are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will let a small harmless persifrage escape here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, perspire, even despise others and are especially dangerous to their surroundings - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr participated twice in the Philadelphia victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again leading the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who again made one more pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great night.
“I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.
"I heard it."
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his Giroux action scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind Hurricanes goals for the palette and presented it to goaltender Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said of his centre.
“I never thought I’d end up playing with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy about that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shootout she ends up with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read didn’t rule out other complications that ended in two versus one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
“He tapped on the pallet, I took some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," Voracek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a 2:3 penalty shootout.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick which mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost points as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement by replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth Winnipeg attack and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a westward inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to “politically incorrect” people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the journeys of the Czechs have undergone a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million vacation days in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in neighbouring Western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with him his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy from the Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased, which has caused another important moment around 1997.
As a result of increasing demand for travel travel, travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter links that, thanks to contracts, have dramatically reduced costs compared to before.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections to virtually most of the developed countries around the world except for the US, which later facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to the faraway warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to be fully included in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including ancillary charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this risks ending in a situation without a "pat" solution.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and there is a risk that Ivan Hasek's successor to head the Football Association of the Czech Republic will not yet be known after yet another General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on what voting rules should be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football return to divergences between the Association's chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to deal with the election.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the officials invested with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still disagreements about the election rules.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round that of the candidates who will have received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech party is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote percentages.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous towers and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian party and who better not to change the regulation and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the election settlement established by the statutes benefits the most Pelta among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet wild ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who is a first-time candidate and who in his presentations has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future as a whole and in a constructive way.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone".
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more room for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professionally and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
“It’s not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the rules on drawing.”
"This may again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the executive committee on the field of retaliation.
In the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik is going to fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen footballers head Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I don't run for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of AFRT who would a priori be given a favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that in case he wins the election, he would hold this position of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would well see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at the moment."
“I would like to change this image,” he added.
What, it is said, especially bothers Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates ' General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, that would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was uttered a few years ago during a wiretap as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away with nothing.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik wins Thursday's vote, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able to."
“I don’t put my nose in what I don’t know,” says Paclik, who in September drew a lot of attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and since last year he also leads the Plzen club which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would restrain the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, who is not seeking his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power in high-level politics would make it possible to obtain more money from the tax on games for sport.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president should address."
“If it’s about the tax on gambling as stated by political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my Plzen club actions to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that are expected to put an end to the pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to quarrels about the regulation for elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of today's football performance should calm this pre-vote war.
Pelta, before the September election that did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the management of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to Jablonec's club, having worked for many years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone saw them.”
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken all the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I’m ready to take all the responsibilities if that doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledges with respect to his law training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also has not long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and he's had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said at his opponent's address but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
It should be a showcase of football.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
“I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all the football,” the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as the head of football would not bring any change of people.
“I should get to know all the employees,” he told Strahov, where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," Pelta said optimistically two days before the likely defining day for his career as a public servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please many people, it seems.
However, Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members deals with a specific area."
“And I’m going to distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward.”
“A lot of people won’t be happy because it’s going to be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He has stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each and every one of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I don’t have to give up because they would give up, too.”
"It's a confidence I can't betray," he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“There’s been a lot of de facto work over the last two years and I don’t want to let it fall.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a number of things, but I certainly can’t stand one.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would be just a president for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would find themselves in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of president, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with television and on the law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football team would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
“No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year.”
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
UFO optic paddlers, Budapest's beautiful swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after touring the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soft water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the past 18 months, there’s one item she shouldn’t miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretched out on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Bath Jewels). The municipal indoor pools of Munich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in the sport but he feels drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It's irritating that swimming fans should just look at blue tiles and take in the squalor of Javel's water while joggers breathe in the scent of spruce forests or can listen to the gazing of the park's joyous birds.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should actually always be so ugly," she said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils – wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects on the other side however the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkaloid and (V<0xC3><0xA1>r) bu<0xC3><0xAD>d<0xC3><0xB6>lf in the form of buitain terosi and (V<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>r) in the form of buitasz in the .
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich bath you can see the whole city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the pianiment.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur smell, from the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool – a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded plot of land.
The bath designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
Taking a look through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed the opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The thermal palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a great achievement to merge such different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural Speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
The Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group’s leader then wants to draw consequences from it.
Hamburg –
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices up and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign actually aligns with Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from the offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no case is worth putting into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how much the banks of today are harming the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before he leaves office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he hardly has to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would cancel investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many customers of the bank would also suffer personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, terminate all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their entourage, 49% answered that they would consider canceling their account to change bank establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion That Moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and holds the place of exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bold and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer is famous for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
To this day, construction is considered an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the train station south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang artworks, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, he now bears the name of "House of the 21st century" and in the future will be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck from any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among other things in her youth as an art skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she particularly successfully carried out the work of transformational and public protection from established politicians and patronage to public men's and women's s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a cafe and a bookshop are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict surveillance, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and through his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a chasm in energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced with a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made way for the new operation, a screened light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against rust of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive were to be found, and which also please the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “coming from Brussels,” said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of “Drop-in-the-City.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And maybe another stroke of luck will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in the millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter season-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung previously reported, citing an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and quays is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of the snow and ice quays until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube, the head of the railway station, warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacked, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot to do for years, given that it has to check the ICE train axles much more often at the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank is paying millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of the head Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if Deutsche Bank’s problems were not enough already, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses large banks of having to induce cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and drove banks down.
“We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties having to start proceedings in court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in New York.
The Bank did not admit any fault in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. co-operative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect client deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now made are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks apart and in the summer it assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit unions are at the root of this.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events already date back a few years, at the moment there is a stormy wind blowing over American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals for redress or to sanction defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in kind in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had dismissed the applications as unwarranted and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal amounts in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad forecasts.
However, he has read IBM's reports and changed his mind about investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
As a result, IBM's IT business is now entitled to be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed today at CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services as the operation of accounting centers.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Buffett, on the other hand, is more concerned with rail freight, with manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as stakes in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola and the Munich Re, the former Munich R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and had made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” also known as IBM, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkish media doubted the state of German law.
A newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population are reacting with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the long-held dead spectrum is re-emerged: since the incendiary attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "This was the title of the Internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned manner: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony marking the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" does not deprive itself of its unique conditions.
This is the title of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it has not already come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in some suspected far-right circles, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least some rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be squandered, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armaments."
"That will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened our feeling in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mostly the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be estimated on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks is towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandal bank of Lake Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July, that he would occupy in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, hailed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently-obtained solidity and has passed from kind remarks on future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the Turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the bank’s security systems and set fire to around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
The head of the board of UBS Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the UBS board has since been seen as suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
All of a sudden he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich tells: "I always took UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have simply been wrong at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli resigned in a surprising way, which until then was considered a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, we found out why he had left.
The bank’s division had flared up with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she did indeed find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was passed in silence, to the point that we never even learned its name.
But this was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce again billions in losses, the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state, given its investment mistakes.
The national bank bought from UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times Switzerland's economic performance (see graph).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with wealthy clients: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost credibility in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud assistance.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate history of securities dealers: a single securities dealer burns 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something is not going around.
And it is published: with the risk management in investment bank it still does not seem to work.
“In the case of Adoboli, it has been found that risk management has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
And the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure of it: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have the control of risk in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long since assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong image of the Swiss private bank - it is only slightly larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse palace to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another strayed from the market – or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Crédit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, eventually like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he believes - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And yet they have long adapted to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then derailed: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for little Switzerland - and has steadily registered an increase.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of UBS completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with the strong point of asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who understands very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli to the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group always said the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already been taken.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
Corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed up and passed value documents based on U.S. mortgages – but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
“Still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The bigger the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Jobs at UBS have become ejectable and so far are bankable.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be transitional when the bank abruptly parted ways with its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he has made a commitment: he must lead the business of UBS in a sustainable way, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to a state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: “it is not yet clear if Europe would be strong enough to do anything to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His more than $10 billion investment in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed him to score nearly 1%, against the trend of business management.

Smart corneas are spreading in cities
In many places, ferrets are considered a "bird problem°" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not let themselves be chased from cities for a long time.
Some love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The corneas have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents multiply because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on corneas, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the weeds out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature protectors based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected ferns: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, setting up, and slaughtering typical pruning trees made life difficult for birds.
The corneas are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the massacre of the corneas in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," noted Leer's town and landscape planner Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver.
The destruction of nests by pressurized water or by felling trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing, and they are spreading to other places.”
Eviction is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of animal eviction with aversive packaging and eye-catching offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens propounded "information panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Training-Educational Baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent ferrets.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "That's a lot of communication, those birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The ferrets not only use working tools to arrive at a feast, but they themselves make their tools as tools of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four ferocity, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the clever cornices were then required to solve a more tricky problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four ferrets are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the European Championship 2012
The hopes of a blow from the Bosnians and the Turks remained unfulfilled.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifying rounds of the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal swept against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the knockout round by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was also nothing more burning in the 0-0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland taking a 1:1 (1:0) draw against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter-penalty hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) have twice made a shortcut to Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities of distance shooting and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English Championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark awarded an 11-meter hand-playing penalty after a Fabio Coentrao action that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech blocked a last-minute goal with a reflex by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface just next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossbow had to come to the rescue of the already shot down world-class keeper of the Czechs, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the third of the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team to coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of with a 4-0 success the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed to top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defense of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first goal.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and clinched the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the next few years and will nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenue to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded revenue of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
The personal mass shooting
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," begins with a long list of characters that will hold your heart.
A tip to get started: carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an extraordinary book which he describes, with exactitude, as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." It contains "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
“Beauty and Grief” summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulances and salesmen.
Some of them will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some of whom will lose members, go mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund’s book departs from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that the First World War can only be summed up by the terrible war of trenches on the Western front.
"Beauty and Grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordite.
When cannon shots are heard in the distance, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or do you run?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been stifled by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried skin from potatoes; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive toward savagery and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a vernissage is not yours and does not claim to be such a vernissity.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is in great danger of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When you're resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience," he wrote.
This is, unfortunately, rather comparable to “a convicted man strangled in secret.”
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls “a new species within the early-century bestiary: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter.”
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
“The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness.”
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task as a human being.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way war has “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory," or Erich Maria Remarque's "To the West Nothing New," rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I’ve read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized with your hands this page where there is a list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the park Zuccotti would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department's regulations and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the progress of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against the riots — anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly moving large numbers of police — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said one regular, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
“The few police officers I know who were called didn’t know they were going to Zuccotti Park,” the person said.
"The only people who know they're going to be there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from around the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people go and come to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages flashing from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched before 1:45 a.m., police said, leaving time for the occupants to gather their belongings.
Other teams of police were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the chief of the police department, said the move was only for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was harshly detained by the officers.
Browne said the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the protesters’ thick business clutter, including luggage, plastic turf and sacks of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the images were posted on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "public order disorder and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer to have been on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "didn't direct operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as Pine Street, to the south.
Police have been seen expanding the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
About 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, others were spotted cracking tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came up while flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The School Aid Union is suing the city for redundancies.
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies, disproportionately impacting schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The lawsuits are probably the union's ultimate weapon, the 37th District Council, in an attempt to get the redundancies canceled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, coordinators of parents and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7. The union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by the workers' groups, and which would have allowed the last budget to be cut.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that school aid redundancies were not specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a notice of complaint, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant, and the plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and is therefore unable to comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and just a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school assistants have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of the southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants at Harlem’s 36 public school, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutors say that “It’s not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap.”
Public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents’ coordinators.
The memo used the term "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Sixty-six parent coordinators have been fired," and "not just because of overreach."
Completed mission: Congress finds agreement on the question of Libya
In the end, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have required a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
Congress’ indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Chairman Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Representatives only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters — especially the new Republicans who want to gild their CV — the chance to boast of being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat – Arizona) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang Broadway’s “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and said she wanted to recover first and foremost rather than return to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on ABC's 20/20 television alongside Diane Sawyer, she struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show tackled his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "rather well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a wide scar on the forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There's been a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” Kelly said.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-suits stood at his feet to cheer him up.
“Military men and women are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military official attending the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were presented as some sort of orphan,” the high-ranking military official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have established between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military officials say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear unappreciative or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they were confronted by insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt a few interviewers were subtly asking him if he would be able to keep up with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
“When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls when speaking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did for World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure to fight against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go on trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant on the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She returned to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
“It was an alarm,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texans have put their concerns aside.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other service members, some still in service and others not, will anxiously await the court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not having stopped the generalization of rapes within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the trial.
Susan Burke says she resents the gallant military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to "eradicate" the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the plaintiffs in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active-duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to war, this distinction is only inscribed on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in making contact with local women.
As a result, of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat situations.
“It’s time for the military to modernize,” said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in the fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the not-for-profit Vietnam Veterans of America foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network's Service for Military Rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with claims for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also looks at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the rape less than an hour after the events.
That night, she said, she was asked to recount her rape 11 times in detail to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sits in front of a judge, at a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was rendered,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start getting contractions, so I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and other plaintiffs will advance or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavy against them ... but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform,” she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t that difficult to find them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’s think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked were about their level of education, their own attitudes towards violence and their own optimism towards violence.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, thanks to “Likes”, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in search, increasing the number of search jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were much more likely to be alcoholics than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle-based Children’s Research Institute.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site’s data team has studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine’s Day, the rate of participation in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available – digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher being able to study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going over the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he told a packed audience of 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a speech with him on paper, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for an additional twelve weeks, forbade him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found it cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy and also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the entire nation.
“I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it’s not,” a relative of a victim said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs that will air this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much that creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram improver - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease leaving them to think that a brilliant idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of geyser work."
In 1995, Bob Cringley developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video was found in the director’s garage.
This slightly edited video is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringley’s questions, giving him elbow strokes to speed it up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then immediately implements them.
Here’s a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“All these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" assessed at a glance, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into telephone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been the subject of many writings before, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” says Jobs, laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we knew how to come up with a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful story that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go out laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett's approach):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager that I was went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he sets up to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember some big fights... I was yelled at and told that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and saw a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that turned out to be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are blowing up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it’s these types of people] who end up running businesses and product staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have made ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas having dinner with opponents of health law as court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court meets in private to consider the issue of political disagreement, namely whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were spotted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a 26-state lawsuit challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 a.m. is expected next March, and the result will likely be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue over the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Solicitor General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another law firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a staunch opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would doubtless argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising by law-related organizations and others even though the judge may not be an intervener, guest of honor, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the case’s law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the Code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Just as incredible is who Boeing got this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisles.
It is the Dubai-based Emirates airline that has passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So they not only have the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel – usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs – would not be so harmful to them since the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates order reinforces Boeing's predominance in the heavy-lift aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to encroach on rival Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus announced it was delaying the start of the largest version of the A350, which directly rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its debut to increase its momentum following the demand from its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to reach $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly defeated in the elections of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid to become governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Initial results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio in an interview Monday following the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral officers... They took the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out just a little bit from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party candidate, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections may seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging ahead of next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to the aid of the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone exit the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the general manager of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers should “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and noted that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has dangerously skyrocketed and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy is going into recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag suggested that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a slowdown in foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day, or even less.
“One day they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to have "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD’s forecasts for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “loss risks” due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from an economic reversal and major capital flight.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defensive Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, including civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but is now worried that an additional $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to agree on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied in this way without discernment, would render most of our ships and our construction projects unworkable — you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness."
The reductions would eventually affect combat troops, Panetta continues.
“Although the wartime financing of the accounts of foreign contingency operations is not directly affected by the seizure, the war effort would be negatively affected by the serious disruptions in the basic budgets,” Panetta warned.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war.”
"Salary management staff would be reduced, resulting in payment delays to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of sequestration of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of Panetta's letter.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not one we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it shouldn’t have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ recent warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the top of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen — a military man with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks at the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed, ill-prepared, and unable force to deal with potential adversaries.”
"De facto, she's inviting aggression."
In an addendum to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could “generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in world wide; and unacceptable assumed risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go down the drain, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how much deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has come across as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign finance related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying in his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on the tests of the school and the university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout out: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, especially in psychology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been debunked.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t blush, blush, or always agitate.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast and ever-evolving body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are able to read others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered on them" while women tell more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that lies tend to be more than lies).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is called "establishing benchmark data".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally stirs their feet constantly so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see them stir their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal deceptive behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief from "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Questioners often falsely state that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be honest... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing the skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan to be routed after U.S. late approval threat
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - angering trade unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to the reroutes.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, vast sources of underground water.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have pushed back any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, it would have to go through six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A family in New York claims that Disco diva Patti LaBelle, who was thrown into a riot in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw them out of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" rant scared 18-month-old Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their Riverside boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter down for a while.
“Someone came up behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went looking for her,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
“She said to me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter by the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘I don’t care what you say or think.’
She became enraged and began to use swear words - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with bottled water.
She said that at this point, Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother – who was still holding Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms – and had to be held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for the children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate change has crippled the economy
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez’s management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations in terms of the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed in the main economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing trillions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical decline of 31.16 percent in the other affected countries.
According to the report by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops were damaged and the main crops were damaged.
The first decrease in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, 18 cents per quarter. The rate of unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, is 6 percents per month. The rate of unemployment in the first three quarters of the year has been accelerated, because from January to March, the rate of unemployment increased from 5 percents per month to 5 percents per month.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which is the loss of liquidity in the market due to a resource restriction by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illegal way it is not easy for them to invest in it,” he said.
Detained migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of Seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is made worse by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and the lack of serious, another reason for the state's shift is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the same period of 3 million years the same 143 million dollars.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, registered mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Let this
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July to the public congress the approval of a 3 trillion pesos state loan, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the state congress was of no more than 2,600 billion pesos.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés’ Government demonstrates a lack of capacity to manage the Government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and especially the good already synchronized march of this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better."
Slow economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year held back the state’s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is not running fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of e flow in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot of work to be done," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident of Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a pick-up truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and in the co-pilot’s seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Offences.
Debts towards contributions to works
The social works contemplated in programs such as H<0xC3><0xA1>bitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished where to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because the Government of the State has failed to meet its obligations to provide contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is going to end soon they did not give us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record delays, we started the works and we have a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has averted the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been collected.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cafetel), contrary to the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also decided to release the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that if he did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing change, he argued, would delay the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It can not be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress in a form, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assures.
We analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 8 thousand votes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Electoral Institute (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve either his Political Constitution or State Electoral Code or State Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to come into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel had omitted them from the public notice of the Law.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state’s representative for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “sanction or challenge” them.
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out the partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting minutes and counting in the ballot box is not in the President's office; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the proceedings.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election ballots may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed winner of the respective election and the candidate who won the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party or representatives who represent the party that is represented.
The total count of the election may also be made if at the end of the common count it results that the difference between the supposed winner candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate is seconded, in which case the electoral packages that were rejected will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant-colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes alongside other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues in the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the Bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that <0x60><0x60>to his family and friends,'' said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and took great care of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, for they said that he even had a bad truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion on which he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for his parent’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His Last Farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, as Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3>n Cortés, as the head of which was Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force and the Mexican Air Force.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his other students.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the stroke of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who have passed through this place have observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee portal was widely open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with suspenders.
A meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to in-situ data, the three people had been murdered in another location because no in-situ sockets were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized crime group to the other, except for a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first act on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
Three buildings and a cell phone were confiscated; they claimed they were part of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that took place on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., military personnel made a surveillance route to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The “frame is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the instability of the markets put the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian boss Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good result,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat-majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support for implementing what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups, and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the new prime minister's success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.9 trillion, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the election.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spaniards is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten took part in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 15:05 hours, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, FIFA's number one monthly ranking, count a wide register of inter-selection games of class A, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity in league championships and national cups and competitions in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifying rounds of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, head coach of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's vanguard, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
The centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left-hand side J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 attendances and goaltender Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet started.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of their two-decade work celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent in Costa Rica once on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it’s exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity in the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so much time has had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered a couple of giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for that?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people as well.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it feel like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that has emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with everyone’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, not to mention the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the amazing person that Andy was, and how fun it was to work with, and how fun it was to laugh at all.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the ones that came out at the same time and, if it’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s a music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that qualify as very dark songs, even though these may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deep dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those songs probably represent that to me.
I also think we can be happy and even that way we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori Hospitalized Again for Medical Examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for muscle strength loss that he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various ailments, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times of tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreas cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving time in the National Police Special Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be “proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations,” according to information published by the South American country’s presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax-exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber goes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, was designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s specialist press officer in Spain, during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", because so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a peek at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustache plumber must navigate platforms mined from danger to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that called for Portillo to be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeys the independence of the judiciary and executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure "he did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done involves an executive approach after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional proceedings to judge the former proxy for the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolved for embezzlement of $120 million from the Department of Defense when he was president, which was the pre-extradition trial, but the Department of Public Prosecutions appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
This is in addition to the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are poorly educated, unemployed, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and current eco-socialist municipal councilor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the General Director of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-festivals, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street lived ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied at noon yesterday and where they organized micro-festivals that desperate neighbors, in judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From this day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and some of the water, except to paint the walls and leave residue of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverage cans.
The first three apartments were the scene of the feasts of the masses, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied his business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property were unfair to her, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last few weeks.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months that he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had last week called for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of life in common and civility that it caused residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be ruthless against the antisocial behavior generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of the convocation beyond the controversy on the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all the doors of access to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient cast of elect speak when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green house p<0xC3><0xA2>tés was not carried out at the end.
“We have to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of these "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, overcoming it.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can cause real disasters.”
Speaking more on the issue, Modol believes that, by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola area "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Board of Directors of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe-conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("any success", he says) that we have had to create: "We architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the basis of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-sectional competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can collide in the program and definition with that of the neighboring door architect.
In his opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal power attorney granted the mayor’s brother’s pardon for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the legal power of Casino Red granted him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s required him to pay an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the PANiste mayor and on September 2, he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's Office stopped the corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal centre allegedly for having made the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by District Second Criminal Court Clerk Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonas' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gaming house in exchange for his operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been recovered and who associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
In accordance with file 197/2011, Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal is granted legal pardon and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for the damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been pardoned legally and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations done in the impact area do not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For now, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruising speed and this happened on a soft ground ascending.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the TBS, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for takeoff, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low-altitude cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the place of the accident there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in a wider area than the surrounding area, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found around the accident, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents' protocol that will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital des Specialités of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the eligible or non-eligible population to attend the IMSS participating sports units in Valle de México, where the evidence is given to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and that is to know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify among Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (we seek to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez reported that this investigation is the result of health professionals’ concern for alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there has also been a dramatic increase,” the IMSS specialist pointed out.
He said the rationale for searching for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that one consumes (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect whether they present a degree of overweight or obesity.
She even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential way, and the doctors hand it over in writing to the parents, who explain each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat paste with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic protocol analyzed.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the pitfalls
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who has ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement could be completed, it would be possible to reduce the amount of tar.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera has estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a lower molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México are mostly covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass by generating effort, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would propagate better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, of sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes cracks.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first that spoils is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of breakage and therefore the thickness of each layer of paving must always be related to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent formation of breakage.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to research and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the pitfalls easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to get the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle receives her 14th princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico is mounted with the crown and the scepter, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina who have found themselves near the crown but have been proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1988, Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1987), Gabriela (1986, Gabriela (1986, Gabriela (1986, Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1968, Gabriela, Gabriela (1986), Gabriela (1986), Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela, Gabriela
Today the big question that many people ask is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Colvaro and Natali.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? asked by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it's a form of culturalization, definitely I believe the book that marked my childhood is 'The Little Prince', it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
This answer did not please firstly because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain concretely how each book quoted had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses launched is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't stage it".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two coronation day parades.
Although at both shows she seemed confident of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN’s “Como en casa” (Coming Home) program, said that the fact that Melina had been named princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the queen crown.”
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jurors Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country’s social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his defects from behind and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen’s trainer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, “but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day”.
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that Valle's mistake was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“Surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came up a cruel prediction that was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was a little gift that Raymundo was making to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typewriter has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4, a CTI fingerprintist from Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typewriters working in local ITC offices, this week it was the turn of Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
Early in his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in Choc<0xC3><0xB3> municipalities, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in fingerprintoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as this one was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typewriter from Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprintoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts,” he recalls.
Footprints can also screen or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a relative may be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
An ITC fingerprintist explained that "the fingerprints of objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a stripper or strip is used to remove them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declensioners’ database, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers,” the ITC expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that one touches does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
'Indignant' defies authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday defied New York authorities by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were shaking in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the “indignant” to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has come to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "indignant" occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned precinct - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
A few protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time, and they even handed it over to police officers who were monitoring the square, which caused “certain small clashes,” Bray said, denouncing the fact that some officials had hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members or applying "laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to move in with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn in place Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was becoming “a place where people didn’t come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people,” because “some stores had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life.”
“This morning’s evacuation at dawn was repugnant and demonstrates that at bottom Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
In addition to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be appearing on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant to Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in a cradle representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Noel program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "pute" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, recovering even after the devastating earthquake that became the country’s worst nuclear disaster since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo estimated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rates.
In addition, the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The yen's stigmatization
Tokyo bounced back to the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refugee values” elected by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the troubled US forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor performance between July and September on the yen.
While markets continue to be based in the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda’s Government is not lowering the guard.
“We need to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries had shown clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in the level 100, n dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds the doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday reported that there is no alternative to the new election for structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his designation will be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new measures required for austerity.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the Staff Code of Discipline and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not raise any doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the bodies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by Papandreou’s all-out referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign “a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible”.
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika's inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses the "preponderant" place of Spain in terms of this type of finances
Spain "has reached a preponderant place globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being.
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has the goal of "reducing the dollar by half the volume of people who live".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new and better loans", especially for the poor.
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we are facing a lot of challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families will come out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, underlined Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought her yesterday the qualification of "head of the family" gathered in Vallado de la Paquerres.
Finally, Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredit presupposes "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes, to which Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, the very Europhile finance minister, were entitled, at the end of their speeches, then a few hours later, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's - and the motion's - guiding idea is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
“The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the motions adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to put the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening the weight of Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty prone to criticize arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the pit.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the disease stop fraud represent?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less foreshadowing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on stopping disease.
First, for the purpose of budget savings: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of absence on private employees before taking care of a work stoppage.
In other words, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks provoking anger, but that would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of uncompensated absence in the event of a stoppage of work (they do not have until now a period of absence, versus three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the topic of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to work stoppages.
“The controls are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you get caught, you’ll pay back,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL’s mic on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the ad effects seem to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of job stop fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% were related to maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were related to sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health care costs.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides certain gaps: another survey, published in 2007 by career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any days off sick leave.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was of less than 8 days duration, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined to stop working than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness stop fraud represents very little in the face of working in the dark.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that the checks on sick leave are systematic for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 completed for short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of "inappropriate or unjustified" cases out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little in comparison, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion in tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to get its economy back on track.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos told Parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the Eurozone "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Refuses New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the goals of reducing deficits and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is necessary, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Across the country, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, said Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, in a teleconference yesterday, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Downie said.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia.
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
For those who committed assisted suicide, 41 percent of those surveyed said they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care for a patient, the situation is less clear, say the report's authors.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts who signed the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But, "in society," he says, "there are labels and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to step down
Damas denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday over Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, have taken a stand in favor of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, told the BBC in an interview.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in the exchange of fire and shelling of heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria “will not bow,” he added, assuring that “ourdic plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he said was paranoid.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November and including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities affected by the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, demanded some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with political parties yesterday before meeting trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet made up of technocrats from outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important programme with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, MP for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President-designate of the Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, of the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying to himself “certainly that the markets will be patient and will understand”.
His appointment by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but concern resumed especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate is expected to form a team that includes mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies" in it.
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative session, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Once he took office, Mr Monti committed himself to working urgently and with the aim of making Italy a "redemptive player" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance goal in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new austerity measures.
The "patron of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "period change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) builds on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents emanating from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of explosive synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within his military nuclear program".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or made little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," the human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant."
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, the head of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could involve improving police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" make it possible to follow more legibly, live the activity of other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else’s message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users were debating at the same time "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” @jemb123 writes.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” @dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria (country)
Inscription of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of Austria's ruling Social Democrat/Christian Democrat grand coalition decided on Tuesday to include a "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and thus avoid possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Austria.
“If Austria’s creditworthiness was lowered by a single tap, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria follows up on a request from the euro area summit in Brussels on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of equal value by the end of 2012.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to raise public debt to 60% by 2020/21, as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of vigour since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, doped with purchases from investors who see it as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is rolled over on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro has fallen under the token bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency harms the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of Japanese firms' revenues from abroad, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan has been struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Noda said, fearing that the yen's rise will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy rebounded in the third quarter – 1.5% from the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption from disaster-stricken households.
But the prime minister said the yen’s price tag did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” hinting that no further monetary easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
The rates are rising, the stock markets are bouncing
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little deeper into negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yielded 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions on the yields of euro area borrowing states in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion,” says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn renewed fears from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes set on Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow fluctuation corridor until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell behind after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing, among other things, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates from Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
Greece’s new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 would be the “main task” of his government.
Spain finds itself in the line of sight of the markets, while legislative elections are being held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between Germany and Spain's 10-year bonds has reached a new, higher historical level.
In anticipation of the growth figures of the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee downwardly revised the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth one that most worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral meeting should be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place where nuclear power is located.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores the full economic, social and environmental implications of the options proposed.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a missing topic in the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find an alternative source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their fleet by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, which focuses on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal-fired power plants.
In a few months, all of these bad effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be considered.
European champion of wind power, of which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; according to which its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest a fundamental opposition to this energy, the polls show it.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them highly creative of non-delocalizable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services annually.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of production of miracle electricity, no more than there is a diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing plants as well as the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the freeway to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let partisan emotion, dogmas and maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the collection of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming at the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be shown to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande speaks out against banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paying electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent economic knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the impact of migration on the global economy.
Restricting immigration anemic growth and harm to employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they risk substituting for national workers, particularly the low-skilled, who are putting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly practicing trades in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow job offers.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenues minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average over the course of his or her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an “instrument of oppression” as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and above all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true Greek referendum has had in this regard the value of a double revelator: that of the need for a powerful return to politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-singing to the absolute European monarch or a united leap in the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bends to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
Because it is together, that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After fighting for a long time this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
Let's go.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
The "contactless" smart cards are generalizing
The global smart card trade show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end on an increase of 11% of global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most important segment is that of contactless technology that makes it possible to pay for public transport or pay for purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to move at higher speeds, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” says Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They're late."
“But they should finally have a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to next June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is expanding
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation,” he explained without further ado.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January last year reportedly uncovered some of the gateways.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their captors in an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has lived long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we should probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect has been receiving outside financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressed Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of uninteresting enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia while its activists engage in the fight against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is invading the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police HQ in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, with al-Shebab Somalis operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans – often unsupported – were used.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the “Grand Old Party,” threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them “for manipulation of their currency,” a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
So much the worse if it has to involve the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flattens” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-best-placed candidate, has an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, on his misrepresentations in Libya, thus labeling him weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is rather positive about Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to entrapment.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
Nord Stream, the new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia to Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be delivered, which is the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same track.
For Gazprom, the completion on time and in time of this huge construction site looks like a victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new Germano-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, in supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in winning its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of this gas pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete sheathed steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up on it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state corporation settle permanently off their coasts.
“In the event of a breakdown, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide by a meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Germany’s E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands’ Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company, for twenty renewable years, the total capacity for gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was provided to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are safe to bear their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand name.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces the businessman as well as the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now counts almost 100 and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also released a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand is available in a wide range of media.
A success that made enviable: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Disheartening?
“No,” points out <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress made over the past 15 years is significant.”
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
“However, there is still a lot to be done.”
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles to accessing employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and out of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, so many criteria that make returning to work singularly difficult, and that "constitute the knot of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for objective brakes.
It remains the unsaid, the mentality that evolves, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of the disability", with "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, people with mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The proof: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates into a real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Que du happiness"
Before facing the Blues Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker’s mood swing against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to move forward,” Lillois said.
As for the contrast between his services in the club and in the selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Managed against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brighten".
Without omitting, however, the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
In front of him are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami).
"We've crossed paths before."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, spoke of "pride."
"Fierté" de disputer "un match de gala".
"Fierté" also noted -as a "neighbor" - that France has "returned to a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You're going to realize it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal’s Paulo Bento is optimistic about his return to Bosnia (22h00) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, of which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to kick off.
Given the away match (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved him.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal on the outside.”
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously announces itself "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
The null reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and to win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal on the outside,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you are realistic this time.
